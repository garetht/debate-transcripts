      "background_text": "THE 64-SQUARE MADHOUSE by FRITZ LEIBER The machine was not perfect. It\n\n could be tricked. It could make\n\n mistakes. And\u2014it could learn!\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1962.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Silently, so as not to shock anyone with illusions about well dressed  young women, Sandra Lea Grayling cursed the day she had persuaded the Chicago Space Mirror that there would be all sorts of human interest  stories to be picked up at the first international grandmaster chess  tournament in which an electronic computing machine was entered.\n\n\n Not that there weren't enough humans around, it was the interest that  was in doubt. The large hall was crammed with energetic dark-suited  men of whom a disproportionately large number were bald, wore glasses,  were faintly untidy and indefinably shabby, had Slavic or Scandinavian  features, and talked foreign languages.\n\n\n They yakked interminably. The only ones who didn't were scurrying  individuals with the eager-zombie look of officials.\n\n\n Chess sets were everywhere\u2014big ones on tables, still bigger  diagram-type electric ones on walls, small peg-in sets dragged from  side pockets and manipulated rapidly as part of the conversational  ritual and still smaller folding sets in which the pieces were the tiny  magnetized disks used for playing in free-fall.\n\n\n There were signs featuring largely mysterious combinations of letters:  FIDE, WBM, USCF, USSF, USSR and UNESCO. Sandra felt fairly sure about  the last three.\n\n\n The many clocks, bedside table size, would have struck a familiar  note except that they had little red flags and wheels sprinkled over  their faces and they were all in pairs, two clocks to a case. That  Siamese-twin clocks should be essential to a chess tournament struck  Sandra as a particularly maddening circumstance. Her last assignment had been to interview the pilot pair riding the  first American manned circum-lunar satellite\u2014and the five alternate  pairs who hadn't made the flight. This tournament hall seemed to Sandra  much further out of the world.\n\n\n Overheard scraps of conversation in reasonably intelligible English  were not particularly helpful. Samples:\n\n\n \"They say the Machine has been programmed to play nothing but pure  Barcza System and Indian Defenses\u2014and the Dragon Formation if anyone  pushes the King Pawn.\"\n\n\n \"Hah! In that case....\"\n\n\n \"The Russians have come with ten trunkfuls of prepared variations and  they'll gang up on the Machine at adjournments. What can one New Jersey  computer do against four Russian grandmasters?\"\n\n\n \"I heard the Russians have been programmed\u2014with hypnotic cramming and  somno-briefing. Votbinnik had a nervous breakdown.\"\n\n\n \"Why, the Machine hasn't even a Haupturnier or an intercollegiate  won. It'll over its head be playing.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, but maybe like Capa at San Sebastian or Morphy or Willie Angler  at New York. The Russians will look like potzers.\"\n\n\n \"Have you studied the scores of the match between Moon Base and  Circum-Terra?\"\n\n\n \"Not worth the trouble. The play was feeble. Barely Expert Rating.\"\n\n\n Sandra's chief difficulty was that she knew absolutely nothing about  the game of chess\u2014a point that she had slid over in conferring with  the powers at the Space Mirror , but that now had begun to weigh on  her. How wonderful it would be, she dreamed, to walk out this minute,  find a quiet bar and get pie-eyed in an evil, ladylike way. \"Perhaps mademoiselle would welcome a drink?\"\n\n\n \"You're durn tootin' she would!\" Sandra replied in a rush, and then  looked down apprehensively at the person who had read her thoughts.\n\n\n It was a small sprightly elderly man who looked like a somewhat  thinned down Peter Lorre\u2014there was that same impression of the happy  Slavic elf. What was left of his white hair was cut very short,  making a silvery nap. His pince-nez had quite thick lenses. But in  sharp contrast to the somberly clad men around them, he was wearing  a pearl-gray suit of almost exactly the same shade as Sandra's\u2014a  circumstance that created for her the illusion that they were fellow  conspirators.\n\n\n \"Hey, wait a minute,\" she protested just the same. He had already taken  her arm and was piloting her toward the nearest flight of low wide  stairs. \"How did you know I wanted a drink?\"\n\n\n \"I could see that mademoiselle was having difficulty swallowing,\" he  replied, keeping them moving. \"Pardon me for feasting my eyes on your  lovely throat.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't suppose they'd serve drinks here.\"\n\n\n \"But of course.\" They were already mounting the stairs. \"What would  chess be without coffee or schnapps?\"\n\n\n \"Okay, lead on,\" Sandra said. \"You're the doctor.\"\n\n\n \"Doctor?\" He smiled widely. \"You know, I like being called that.\"\n\n\n \"Then the name is yours as long as you want it\u2014Doc.\" Meanwhile the happy little man had edged them into the first of a small  cluster of tables, where a dark-suited jabbering trio was just rising.  He snapped his fingers and hissed through his teeth. A white-aproned  waiter materialized.\n\n\n \"For myself black coffee,\" he said. \"For mademoiselle rhine wine and  seltzer?\"\n\n\n \"That'd go fine.\" Sandra leaned back. \"Confidentially, Doc, I was  having trouble swallowing ... well, just about everything here.\"\n\n\n He nodded. \"You are not the first to be shocked and horrified by  chess,\" he assured her. \"It is a curse of the intellect. It is a game  for lunatics\u2014or else it creates them. But what brings a sane and  beautiful young lady to this 64-square madhouse?\"\n\n\n Sandra briefly told him her story and her predicament. By the time they  were served, Doc had absorbed the one and assessed the other.\n\n\n \"You have one great advantage,\" he told her. \"You know nothing  whatsoever of chess\u2014so you will be able to write about it  understandably for your readers.\" He swallowed half his demitasse and  smacked his lips. \"As for the Machine\u2014you do know, I suppose, that  it is not a humanoid metal robot, walking about clanking and squeaking  like a late medieval knight in armor?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Doc, but....\" Sandra found difficulty in phrasing the question.\n\n\n \"Wait.\" He lifted a finger. \"I think I know what you're going to ask.  You want to know why, if the Machine works at all, it doesn't work  perfectly, so that it always wins and there is no contest. Right?\"\n\n\n Sandra grinned and nodded. Doc's ability to interpret her mind was as  comforting as the bubbly, mildly astringent mixture she was sipping.\n\n\n He removed his pince-nez, massaged the bridge of his nose and replaced  them.\n\n\n \"If you had,\" he said, \"a billion computers all as fast as the Machine,  it would take them all the time there ever will be in the universe just  to play through all the possible games of chess, not to mention the  time needed to classify those games into branching families of wins for  White, wins for Black and draws, and the additional time required to  trace out chains of key-moves leading always to wins. So the Machine  can't play chess like God. What the Machine can do is examine all the  likely lines of play for about eight moves ahead\u2014that is, four moves  each for White and Black\u2014and then decide which is the best move on the  basis of capturing enemy pieces, working toward checkmate, establishing  a powerful central position and so on.\" \"That sounds like the way a man would play a game,\" Sandra observed.  \"Look ahead a little way and try to make a plan. You know, like getting  out trumps in bridge or setting up a finesse.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" Doc beamed at her approvingly. \"The Machine is like a  man. A rather peculiar and not exactly pleasant man. A man who always  abides by sound principles, who is utterly incapable of flights of  genius, but who never makes a mistake. You see, you are finding human  interest already, even in the Machine.\"\n\n\n Sandra nodded. \"Does a human chess player\u2014a grandmaster, I mean\u2014ever  look eight moves ahead in a game?\"\n\n\n \"Most assuredly he does! In crucial situations, say where there's a  chance of winning at once by trapping the enemy king, he examines  many more moves ahead than that\u2014thirty or forty even. The Machine  is probably programmed to recognize such situations and do something  of the same sort, though we can't be sure from the information World  Business Machines has released. But in most chess positions the  possibilities are so very nearly unlimited that even a grandmaster can  only look a very few moves ahead and must rely on his judgment and  experience and artistry. The equivalent of those in the Machine is the  directions fed into it before it plays a game.\"\n\n\n \"You mean the programming?\"\n\n\n \"Indeed yes! The programming is the crux of the problem of the  chess-playing computer. The first practical model, reported by  Bernstein and Roberts of IBM in 1958 and which looked four moves  ahead, was programmed so that it had a greedy worried tendency to grab  at enemy pieces and to retreat its own whenever they were attacked. It  had a personality like that of a certain kind of chess-playing dub\u2014a  dull-brained woodpusher afraid to take the slightest risk of losing  material\u2014but a dub who could almost always beat an utter novice.  The WBM machine here in the hall operates about a million times as  fast. Don't ask me how, I'm no physicist, but it depends on the new  transistors and something they call hypervelocity, which in turn  depends on keeping parts of the Machine at a temperature near absolute  zero. However, the result is that the Machine can see eight moves ahead  and is capable of being programmed much more craftily.\"\n\n\n \"A million times as fast as the first machine, you say, Doc? And yet it  only sees twice as many moves ahead?\" Sandra objected.\n\n\n \"There is a geometrical progression involved there,\" he told her  with a smile. \"Believe me, eight moves ahead is a lot of moves when  you remember that the Machine is errorlessly examining every one of  thousands of variations. Flesh-and-blood chess masters have lost games  by blunders they could have avoided by looking only one or two moves  ahead. The Machine will make no such oversights. Once again, you see,  you have the human factor, in this case working for the Machine.\"\n\n\n \"Savilly, I have been looking allplace for you!\"\n\n\n A stocky, bull-faced man with a great bristling shock of black,  gray-flecked hair had halted abruptly by their table. He bent over Doc  and began to whisper explosively in a guttural foreign tongue. Sandra's gaze traveled beyond the balustrade. Now that she could look  down at it, the central hall seemed less confusedly crowded. In the  middle, toward the far end, were five small tables spaced rather widely  apart and with a chessboard and men and one of the Siamese clocks set  out on each. To either side of the hall were tiers of temporary seats,  about half of them occupied. There were at least as many more people  still wandering about.\n\n\n On the far wall was a big electric scoreboard and also, above the  corresponding tables, five large dully glassy chessboards, the White  squares in light gray, the Black squares in dark.\n\n\n One of the five wall chessboards was considerably larger than the other  four\u2014the one above the Machine.\n\n\n Sandra looked with quickening interest at the console of the Machine\u2014a  bank of keys and some half-dozen panels of rows and rows of tiny  telltale lights, all dark at the moment. A thick red velvet cord on  little brass standards ran around the Machine at a distance of about  ten feet. Inside the cord were only a few gray-smocked men. Two of  them had just laid a black cable to the nearest chess table and were  attaching it to the Siamese clock.\n\n\n Sandra tried to think of a being who always checked everything, but  only within limits beyond which his thoughts never ventured, and who  never made a mistake....\n\n\n \"Miss Grayling! May I present to you Igor Jandorf.\"\n\n\n She turned back quickly with a smile and a nod.\n\n\n \"I should tell you, Igor,\" Doc continued, \"that Miss Grayling  represents a large and influential Midwestern newspaper. Perhaps you  have a message for her readers.\"\n\n\n The shock-headed man's eyes flashed. \"I most certainly do!\" At that  moment the waiter arrived with a second coffee and wine-and-seltzer.  Jandorf seized Doc's new demitasse, drained it, set it back on the tray  with a flourish and drew himself up. \"Tell your readers, Miss Grayling,\" he proclaimed, fiercely arching his  eyebrows at her and actually slapping his chest, \"that I, Igor Jandorf,  will defeat the Machine by the living force of my human personality!  Already I have offered to play it an informal game blindfold\u2014I, who  have played 50 blindfold games simultaneously! Its owners refuse me. I  have challenged it also to a few games of rapid-transit\u2014an offer no  true grandmaster would dare ignore. Again they refuse me. I predict  that the Machine will play like a great oaf\u2014at least against me .  Repeat: I, Igor Jandorf, by the living force of my human personality,  will defeat the Machine. Do you have that? You can remember it?\"\n\n\n \"Oh yes,\" Sandra assured him, \"but there are some other questions I  very much want to ask you, Mr. Jandorf.\"\n\n\n \"I am sorry, Miss Grayling, but I must clear my mind now. In ten  minutes they start the clocks.\"\n\n\n While Sandra arranged for an interview with Jandorf after the day's  playing session, Doc reordered his coffee.\n\n\n \"One expects it of Jandorf,\" he explained to Sandra with a philosophic  shrug when the shock-headed man was gone. \"At least he didn't take your  wine-and-seltzer. Or did he? One tip I have for you: don't call a chess  master Mister, call him Master. They all eat it up.\"\n\n\n \"Gee, Doc, I don't know how to thank you for everything. I hope I  haven't offended Mis\u2014Master Jandorf so that he doesn't\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about that. Wild horses couldn't keep Jandorf away from a  press interview. You know, his rapid-transit challenge was cunning.  That's a minor variety of chess where each player gets only ten seconds  to make a move. Which I don't suppose would give the Machine time to  look three moves ahead. Chess players would say that the Machine has a  very slow sight of the board. This tournament is being played at the  usual international rate of 15 moves an hour, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is that why they've got all those crazy clocks?\" Sandra interrupted.\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. Chess clocks measure the time each player takes in making his  moves. When a player makes a move he presses a button that shuts his  clock off and turns his opponent's on. If a player uses too much time,  he loses as surely as if he were checkmated. Now since the Machine  will almost certainly be programmed to take an equal amount of time  on successive moves, a rate of 15 moves an hour means it will have 4  minutes a move\u2014and it will need every second of them! Incidentally  it was typical Jandorf bravado to make a point of a blindfold  challenge\u2014just as if the Machine weren't playing blindfold itself. Or is the Machine blindfold? How do you think of it?\"\n\n\n \"Gosh, I don't know. Say, Doc, is it really true that Master Jandorf  has played 50 games at once blindfolded? I can't believe that.\" \"Of course not!\" Doc assured her. \"It was only 49 and he lost two of  those and drew five. Jandorf always exaggerates. It's in his blood.\"\n\n\n \"He's one of the Russians, isn't he?\" Sandra asked. \"Igor?\"\n\n\n Doc chuckled. \"Not exactly,\" he said gently. \"He is originally a Pole  and now he has Argentinian citizenship. You have a program, don't you?\"\n\n\n Sandra started to hunt through her pocketbook, but just then two lists  of names lit up on the big electric scoreboard. THE PLAYERS William Angler, USA\n\n Bela Grabo, Hungary\n\n Ivan Jal, USSR\n\n Igor Jandorf, Argentina\n\n Dr. S. Krakatower, France\n\n Vassily Lysmov, USSR\n\n The Machine, USA (programmed by Simon Great)\n\n Maxim Serek, USSR\n\n Moses Sherevsky, USA\n\n Mikhail Votbinnik, USSR Tournament Director : Dr. Jan Vanderhoef FIRST ROUND PAIRINGS Sherevsky vs. Serek\n\n Jal vs. Angler\n\n Jandorf vs. Votbinnik\n\n Lysmov vs. Krakatower\n\n Grabo vs. Machine\n\n\n \"Cripes, Doc, they all sound like they were Russians,\" Sandra said  after a bit. \"Except this Willie Angler. Oh, he's the boy wonder,  isn't he?\"\n\n\n Doc nodded. \"Not such a boy any longer, though. He's.... Well, speak of  the Devil's children.... Miss Grayling, I have the honor of presenting  to you the only grandmaster ever to have been ex-chess-champion of the  United States while still technically a minor\u2014Master William Augustus  Angler.\"\n\n\n A tall, sharply-dressed young man with a hatchet face pressed the old  man back into his chair.\n\n\n \"How are you, Savvy, old boy old boy?\" he demanded. \"Still chasing the  girls, I see.\"\n\n\n \"Please, Willie, get off me.\"\n\n\n \"Can't take it, huh?\" Angler straightened up somewhat. \"Hey waiter!  Where's that chocolate malt? I don't want it next year. About that ex- , though. I was swindled, Savvy. I was robbed.\"\n\n\n \"Willie!\" Doc said with some asperity. \"Miss Grayling is a journalist.  She would like to have a statement from you as to how you will play  against the Machine.\" Angler grinned and shook his head sadly. \"Poor old Machine,\" he said.  \"I don't know why they take so much trouble polishing up that pile of  tin just so that I can give it a hit in the head. I got a hatful of  moves it'll burn out all its tubes trying to answer. And if it gets too  fresh, how about you and me giving its low-temperature section the  hotfoot, Savvy? The money WBM's putting up is okay, though. That first  prize will just fit the big hole in my bank account.\"\n\n\n \"I know you haven't the time now, Master Angler,\" Sandra said rapidly,  \"but if after the playing session you could grant me\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sorry, babe,\" Angler broke in with a wave of dismissal. \"I'm dated up  for two months in advance. Waiter! I'm here, not there!\" And he went  charging off.\n\n\n Doc and Sandra looked at each other and smiled.\n\n\n \"Chess masters aren't exactly humble people, are they?\" she said.\n\n\n Doc's smile became tinged with sad understanding. \"You must excuse  them, though,\" he said. \"They really get so little recognition or  recompense. This tournament is an exception. And it takes a great deal  of ego to play greatly.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so. So World Business Machines is responsible for this  tournament?\"\n\n\n \"Correct. Their advertising department is interested in the prestige.  They want to score a point over their great rival.\"\n\n\n \"But if the Machine plays badly it will be a black eye for them,\"  Sandra pointed out.\n\n\n \"True,\" Doc agreed thoughtfully. \"WBM must feel very sure.... It's  the prize money they've put up, of course, that's brought the world's  greatest players here. Otherwise half of them would be holding off  in the best temperamental-artist style. For chess players the prize  money is fabulous\u2014$35,000, with $15,000 for first place, and all  expenses paid for all players. There's never been anything like it.  Soviet Russia is the only country that has ever supported and rewarded  her best chess players at all adequately. I think the Russian players  are here because UNESCO and FIDE (that's Federation Internationale  des Echecs \u2014the international chess organization) are also backing  the tournament. And perhaps because the Kremlin is hungry for a little  prestige now that its space program is sagging.\"\n\n\n \"But if a Russian doesn't take first place it will be a black eye for  them.\"\n\n\n Doc frowned. \"True, in a sense. They must feel very sure.... Here  they are now.\" Four men were crossing the center of the hall, which was clearing,  toward the tables at the other end. Doubtless they just happened to be  going two by two in close formation, but it gave Sandra the feeling of  a phalanx.\n\n\n \"The first two are Lysmov and Votbinnik,\" Doc told her. \"It isn't often  that you see the current champion of the world\u2014Votbinnik\u2014and an  ex-champion arm in arm. There are two other persons in the tournament  who have held that honor\u2014Jal and Vanderhoef the director, way back.\"\n\n\n \"Will whoever wins this tournament become champion?\"\n\n\n \"Oh no. That's decided by two-player matches\u2014a very long  business\u2014after elimination tournaments between leading contenders.  This tournament is a round robin: each player plays one game with every  other player. That means nine rounds.\"\n\n\n \"Anyway there are an awful lot of Russians in the tournament,\"  Sandra said, consulting her program. \"Four out of ten have USSR after  them. And Bela Grabo, Hungary\u2014that's a satellite. And Sherevsky and  Krakatower are Russian-sounding names.\"\n\n\n \"The proportion of Soviet to American entries in the tournament  represents pretty fairly the general difference in playing strength  between the two countries,\" Doc said judiciously. \"Chess mastery  moves from land to land with the years. Way back it was the Moslems  and the Hindus and Persians. Then Italy and Spain. A little over a  hundred years ago it was France and England. Then Germany, Austria  and the New World. Now it's Russia\u2014including of course the Russians  who have run away from Russia. But don't think there aren't a lot of  good Anglo-Saxon types who are masters of the first water. In fact,  there are a lot of them here around us, though perhaps you don't  think so. It's just that if you play a lot of chess you get to looking  Russian. Once it probably made you look Italian. Do you see that short  bald-headed man?\"\n\n\n \"You mean the one facing the Machine and talking to Jandorf?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Now that's one with a lot of human interest. Moses Sherevsky.  Been champion of the United States many times. A very strict Orthodox  Jew. Can't play chess on Fridays or on Saturdays before sundown.\" He  chuckled. \"Why, there's even a story going around that one rabbi told  Sherevsky it would be unlawful for him to play against the Machine  because it is technically a golem \u2014the clay Frankenstein's monster of  Hebrew legend.\"\n\n\n Sandra asked, \"What about Grabo and Krakatower?\" Doc gave a short scornful laugh. \"Krakatower! Don't pay any attention  to him . A senile has-been, it's a scandal he's been allowed to play  in this tournament! He must have pulled all sorts of strings. Told them  that his lifelong services to chess had won him the honor and that they  had to have a member of the so-called Old Guard. Maybe he even got down  on his knees and cried\u2014and all the time his eyes on that expense money  and the last-place consolation prize! Yet dreaming schizophrenically  of beating them all! Please, don't get me started on Dirty Old  Krakatower.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Doc. He sounds like he would make an interesting  article? Can you point him out to me?\"\n\n\n \"You can tell him by his long white beard with coffee stains. I don't  see it anywhere, though. Perhaps he's shaved it off for the occasion.  It would be like that antique womanizer to develop senile delusions of  youthfulness.\"\n\n\n \"And Grabo?\" Sandra pressed, suppressing a smile at the intensity of  Doc's animosity.\n\n\n Doc's eyes grew thoughtful. \"About Bela Grabo (why are three out of  four Hungarians named Bela?) I will tell you only this: That he is a  very brilliant player and that the Machine is very lucky to have drawn  him as its first opponent.\"\n\n\n He would not amplify his statement. Sandra studied the Scoreboard again.\n\n\n \"This Simon Great who's down as programming the Machine. He's a famous  physicist, I suppose?\"\n\n\n \"By no means. That was the trouble with some of the early chess-playing  machines\u2014they were programmed by scientists. No, Simon Great is a  psychologist who at one time was a leading contender for the world's  chess championship. I think WBM was surprisingly shrewd to pick him  for the programming job. Let me tell you\u2014No, better yet\u2014\"\n\n\n Doc shot to his feet, stretched an arm on high and called out sharply,  \"Simon!\"\n\n\n A man some four tables away waved back and a moment later came over.\n\n\n \"What is it, Savilly?\" he asked. \"There's hardly any time, you know.\" The newcomer was of middle height, compact of figure and feature, with  graying hair cut short and combed sharply back.\n\n\n Doc spoke his piece for Sandra.\n\n\n Simon Great smiled thinly. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"But I am making no  predictions and we are giving out no advance information on the  programming of the Machine. As you know, I have had to fight the  Players' Committee tooth and nail on all sorts of points about that  and they have won most of them. I am not permitted to re-program the  Machine at adjournments\u2014only between games (I did insist on that and  get it!) And if the Machine breaks down during a game, its clock keeps  running on it. My men are permitted to make repairs\u2014if they can work  fast enough.\"\n\n\n \"That makes it very tough on you,\" Sandra put in. \"The Machine isn't  allowed any weaknesses.\"\n\n\n Great nodded soberly. \"And now I must go. They've almost finished the  count-down, as one of my technicians keeps on calling it. Very pleased  to have met you, Miss Grayling\u2014I'll check with our PR man on that  interview. Be seeing you, Savvy.\"\n\n\n The tiers of seats were filled now and the central space almost clear.  Officials were shooing off a few knots of lingerers. Several of the  grandmasters, including all four Russians, were seated at their tables.  Press and company cameras were flashing. The four smaller wallboards  lit up with the pieces in the opening position\u2014white for White and red  for Black. Simon Great stepped over the red velvet cord and more flash  bulbs went off.\n\n\n \"You know, Doc,\" Sandra said, \"I'm a dog to suggest this, but what  if this whole thing were a big fake? What if Simon Great were really  playing the Machine's moves? There would surely be some way for his  electricians to rig\u2014\"\n\n\n Doc laughed happily\u2014and so loudly that some people at the adjoining  tables frowned.\n\n\n \"Miss Grayling, that is a wonderful idea! I will probably steal it for  a short story. I still manage to write and place a few in England.  No, I do not think that is at all likely. WBM would never risk such  a fraud. Great is completely out of practice for actual tournament  play, though not for chess-thinking. The difference in style between  a computer and a man would be evident to any expert. Great's own style  is remembered and would be recognized\u2014though, come to think of it, his  style was often described as being machinelike....\" For a moment Doc's  eyes became thoughtful. Then he smiled again. \"But no, the idea is  impossible. Vanderhoef as Tournament Director has played two or three  games with the Machine to assure himself that it operates legitimately  and has grandmaster skill.\"\n\n\n \"Did the Machine beat him?\" Sandra asked. Doc shrugged. \"The scores weren't released. It was very hush-hush.  But about your idea, Miss Grayling\u2014did you ever read about Maelzel's  famous chess-playing automaton of the 19th Century? That one too was  supposed to work by machinery (cogs and gears, not electricity) but  actually it had a man hidden inside it\u2014your Edgar Poe exposed the  fraud in a famous article. In my story I think the chess robot will  break down while it is being demonstrated to a millionaire purchaser  and the young inventor will have to win its game for it to cover up  and swing the deal. Only the millionaire's daughter, who is really a  better player than either of them ... yes, yes! Your Ambrose Bierce  too wrote a story about a chess-playing robot of the clickety-clank-grr  kind who murdered his creator, crushing him like an iron grizzly bear  when the man won a game from him. Tell me, Miss Grayling, do you find  yourself imagining this Machine putting out angry tendrils to strangle  its opponents, or beaming rays of death and hypnotism at them? I can  imagine....\"\n\n\n While Doc chattered happily on about chess-playing robots and chess  stories, Sandra found herself thinking about him. A writer of some sort  evidently and a terrific chess buff. Perhaps he was an actual medical  doctor. She'd read something about two or three coming over with the  Russian squad. But Doc certainly didn't sound like a Soviet citizen.\n\n\n He was older than she'd first assumed. She could see that now that  she was listening to him less and looking at him more. Tired, too.  Only his dark-circled eyes shone with unquenchable youth. A useful old  guy, whoever he was. An hour ago she'd been sure she was going to muff  this assignment completely and now she had it laid out cold. For the  umpteenth time in her career Sandra shied away from the guilty thought  that she wasn't a writer at all or even a reporter, she just used  dime-a-dozen female attractiveness to rope a susceptible man (young,  old, American, Russian) and pick his brain....\n\n\n She realized suddenly that the whole hall had become very quiet.\n\n\n Doc was the only person still talking and people were again looking at  them disapprovingly. All five wallboards were lit up and the changed  position of a few pieces showed that opening moves had been made on  four of them, including the Machine's. The central space between  the tiers of seats was completely clear now, except for one man  hurrying across it in their direction with the rapid yet quiet, almost  tip-toe walk that seemed to mark all the officials. Like morticians'  assistants , she thought. He rapidly mounted the stairs and halted at  the top to look around searchingly. His gaze lighted on their table,  his eyebrows went up, and he made a beeline for Doc. Sandra wondered if  she should warn him that he was about to be shushed.\n\n\n The official laid a hand on Doc's shoulder. \"Sir!\" he said agitatedly.  \"Do you realize that they've started your clock, Dr. Krakatower?\" ",

It\n\n could be tricked. It could make\n\n mistakes. And\u2014it could learn!\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1962.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Silently, so as not to shock anyone with illusions about well dressed  young women, Sandra Lea Grayling cursed the day she had persuaded the Chicago Space Mirror that there would be all sorts of human interest  stories to be picked up at the first international grandmaster chess  tournament in which an electronic computing machine was entered.\n\n\n Not that there weren't enough humans around, it was the interest that  was in doubt. The large hall was crammed with energetic dark-suited  men of whom a disproportionately large number were bald, wore glasses,  were faintly untidy and indefinably shabby, had Slavic or Scandinavian  features, and talked foreign languages.\n\n\n They yakked interminably. The only ones who didn't were scurrying  individuals with the eager-zombie look of officials.\n\n\n Chess sets were everywhere\u2014big ones on tables, still bigger  diagram-type electric ones on walls, small peg-in sets dragged from  side pockets and manipulated rapidly as part of the conversational  ritual and still smaller folding sets in which the pieces were the tiny  magnetized disks used for playing in free-fall.\n\n\n There were signs featuring largely mysterious combinations of letters:  FIDE, WBM, USCF, USSF, USSR and UNESCO. Sandra felt fairly sure about  the last three.\n\n\n The many clocks, bedside table size, would have struck a familiar  note except that they had little red flags and wheels sprinkled over  their faces and they were all in pairs, two clocks to a case. That  Siamese-twin clocks should be essential to a chess tournament struck  Sandra as a particularly maddening circumstance. Her last assignment had been to interview the pilot pair riding the  first American manned circum-lunar satellite\u2014and the five alternate  pairs who hadn't made the flight. This tournament hall seemed to Sandra  much further out of the world.\n\n\n Overheard scraps of conversation in reasonably intelligible English  were not particularly helpful. Samples:\n\n\n \"They say the Machine has been programmed to play nothing but pure  Barcza System and Indian Defenses\u2014and the Dragon Formation if anyone  pushes the King Pawn.\"\n\n\n \"Hah! In that case....\"\n\n\n \"The Russians have come with ten trunkfuls of prepared variations and  they'll gang up on the Machine at adjournments. What can one New Jersey  computer do against four Russian grandmasters?\"\n\n\n \"I heard the Russians have been programmed\u2014with hypnotic cramming and  somno-briefing. Votbinnik had a nervous breakdown.\"\n\n\n \"Why, the Machine hasn't even a Haupturnier or an intercollegiate  won. It'll over its head be playing.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, but maybe like Capa at San Sebastian or Morphy or Willie Angler  at New York. The Russians will look like potzers.\"\n\n\n \"Have you studied the scores of the match between Moon Base and  Circum-Terra?\"\n\n\n \"Not worth the trouble. The play was feeble. Barely Expert Rating.\"\n\n\n Sandra's chief difficulty was that she knew absolutely nothing about  the game of chess\u2014a point that she had slid over in conferring with  the powers at the Space Mirror , but that now had begun to weigh on  her. How wonderful it would be, she dreamed, to walk out this minute,  find a quiet bar and get pie-eyed in an evil, ladylike way. \"Perhaps mademoiselle would welcome a drink?\"\n\n\n \"You're durn tootin' she would!\" Sandra replied in a rush, and then  looked down apprehensively at the person who had read her thoughts.\n\n\n It was a small sprightly elderly man who looked like a somewhat  thinned down Peter Lorre\u2014there was that same impression of the happy  Slavic elf. What was left of his white hair was cut very short,  making a silvery nap. His pince-nez had quite thick lenses. But in  sharp contrast to the somberly clad men around them, he was wearing  a pearl-gray suit of almost exactly the same shade as Sandra's\u2014a  circumstance that created for her the illusion that they were fellow  conspirators.\n\n\n \"Hey, wait a minute,\" she protested just the same. He had already taken  her arm and was piloting her toward the nearest flight of low wide  stairs. \"How did you know I wanted a drink?\"\n\n\n \"I could see that mademoiselle was having difficulty swallowing,\" he  replied, keeping them moving. \"Pardon me for feasting my eyes on your  lovely throat.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't suppose they'd serve drinks here.\"\n\n\n \"But of course.\" They were already mounting the stairs. \"What would  chess be without coffee or schnapps?\"\n\n\n \"Okay, lead on,\" Sandra said. \"You're the doctor.\"\n\n\n \"Doctor?\" He smiled widely. \"You know, I like being called that.\"\n\n\n \"Then the name is yours as long as you want it\u2014Doc.\" Meanwhile the happy little man had edged them into the first of a small  cluster of tables, where a dark-suited jabbering trio was just rising.  He snapped his fingers and hissed through his teeth. A white-aproned  waiter materialized.\n\n\n \"For myself black coffee,\" he said. \"For mademoiselle rhine wine and  seltzer?\"\n\n\n \"That'd go fine.\" Sandra leaned back. \"Confidentially, Doc, I was  having trouble swallowing ... well, just about everything here.\"\n\n\n He nodded. \"You are not the first to be shocked and horrified by  chess,\" he assured her. \"It is a curse of the intellect. It is a game  for lunatics\u2014or else it creates them. But what brings a sane and  beautiful young lady to this 64-square madhouse?\"\n\n\n Sandra briefly told him her story and her predicament. By the time they  were served, Doc had absorbed the one and assessed the other.\n\n\n \"You have one great advantage,\" he told her. \"You know nothing  whatsoever of chess\u2014so you will be able to write about it  understandably for your readers.\" He swallowed half his demitasse and  smacked his lips. \"As for the Machine\u2014you do know, I suppose, that  it is not a humanoid metal robot, walking about clanking and squeaking  like a late medieval knight in armor?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Doc, but....\" Sandra found difficulty in phrasing the question.\n\n\n \"Wait.\" He lifted a finger. \"I think I know what you're going to ask.  You want to know why, if the Machine works at all, it doesn't work  perfectly, so that it always wins and there is no contest. Right?\"\n\n\n Sandra grinned and nodded. Doc's ability to interpret her mind was as  comforting as the bubbly, mildly astringent mixture she was sipping.\n\n\n He removed his pince-nez, massaged the bridge of his nose and replaced  them.\n\n\n \"If you had,\" he said, \"a billion computers all as fast as the Machine,  it would take them all the time there ever will be in the universe just  to play through all the possible games of chess, not to mention the  time needed to classify those games into branching families of wins for  White, wins for Black and draws, and the additional time required to  trace out chains of key-moves leading always to wins. So the Machine  can't play chess like God. What the Machine can do is examine all the  likely lines of play for about eight moves ahead\u2014that is, four moves  each for White and Black\u2014and then decide which is the best move on the  basis of capturing enemy pieces, working toward checkmate, establishing  a powerful central position and so on.\" \"That sounds like the way a man would play a game,\" Sandra observed.  \"Look ahead a little way and try to make a plan. You know, like getting  out trumps in bridge or setting up a finesse.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" Doc beamed at her approvingly. \"The Machine is like a  man. A rather peculiar and not exactly pleasant man. A man who always  abides by sound principles, who is utterly incapable of flights of  genius, but who never makes a mistake. You see, you are finding human  interest already, even in the Machine.\"\n\n\n Sandra nodded. \"Does a human chess player\u2014a grandmaster, I mean\u2014ever  look eight moves ahead in a game?\"\n\n\n \"Most assuredly he does! In crucial situations, say where there's a  chance of winning at once by trapping the enemy king, he examines  many more moves ahead than that\u2014thirty or forty even. The Machine  is probably programmed to recognize such situations and do something  of the same sort, though we can't be sure from the information World  Business Machines has released. But in most chess positions the  possibilities are so very nearly unlimited that even a grandmaster can  only look a very few moves ahead and must rely on his judgment and  experience and artistry. The equivalent of those in the Machine is the  directions fed into it before it plays a game.\"\n\n\n \"You mean the programming?\"\n\n\n \"Indeed yes! The programming is the crux of the problem of the  chess-playing computer. The first practical model, reported by  Bernstein and Roberts of IBM in 1958 and which looked four moves  ahead, was programmed so that it had a greedy worried tendency to grab  at enemy pieces and to retreat its own whenever they were attacked. It  had a personality like that of a certain kind of chess-playing dub\u2014a  dull-brained woodpusher afraid to take the slightest risk of losing  material\u2014but a dub who could almost always beat an utter novice.  The WBM machine here in the hall operates about a million times as  fast. Don't ask me how, I'm no physicist, but it depends on the new  transistors and something they call hypervelocity, which in turn  depends on keeping parts of the Machine at a temperature near absolute  zero. However, the result is that the Machine can see eight moves ahead  and is capable of being programmed much more craftily.\"\n\n\n \"A million times as fast as the first machine, you say, Doc? And yet it  only sees twice as many moves ahead?\" Sandra objected.\n\n\n \"There is a geometrical progression involved there,\" he told her  with a smile. \"Believe me, eight moves ahead is a lot of moves when  you remember that the Machine is errorlessly examining every one of  thousands of variations. Flesh-and-blood chess masters have lost games  by blunders they could have avoided by looking only one or two moves  ahead. The Machine will make no such oversights. Once again, you see,  you have the human factor, in this case working for the Machine.\"\n\n\n \"Savilly, I have been looking allplace for you!\"\n\n\n A stocky, bull-faced man with a great bristling shock of black,  gray-flecked hair had halted abruptly by their table. He bent over Doc  and began to whisper explosively in a guttural foreign tongue. Sandra's gaze traveled beyond the balustrade. Now that she could look  down at it, the central hall seemed less confusedly crowded. In the  middle, toward the far end, were five small tables spaced rather widely  apart and with a chessboard and men and one of the Siamese clocks set  out on each. To either side of the hall were tiers of temporary seats,  about half of them occupied. There were at least as many more people  still wandering about.\n\n\n On the far wall was a big electric scoreboard and also, above the  corresponding tables, five large dully glassy chessboards, the White  squares in light gray, the Black squares in dark.\n\n\n One of the five wall chessboards was considerably larger than the other  four\u2014the one above the Machine.\n\n\n Sandra looked with quickening interest at the console of the Machine\u2014a  bank of keys and some half-dozen panels of rows and rows of tiny  telltale lights, all dark at the moment. A thick red velvet cord on  little brass standards ran around the Machine at a distance of about  ten feet. Inside the cord were only a few gray-smocked men. Two of  them had just laid a black cable to the nearest chess table and were  attaching it to the Siamese clock.\n\n\n Sandra tried to think of a being who always checked everything, but  only within limits beyond which his thoughts never ventured, and who  never made a mistake....\n\n\n \"Miss Grayling! May I present to you Igor Jandorf.\"\n\n\n She turned back quickly with a smile and a nod.\n\n\n \"I should tell you, Igor,\" Doc continued, \"that Miss Grayling  represents a large and influential Midwestern newspaper. Perhaps you  have a message for her readers.\"\n\n\n The shock-headed man's eyes flashed. \"I most certainly do!\" At that  moment the waiter arrived with a second coffee and wine-and-seltzer.  Jandorf seized Doc's new demitasse, drained it, set it back on the tray  with a flourish and drew himself up. \"Tell your readers, Miss Grayling,\" he proclaimed, fiercely arching his  eyebrows at her and actually slapping his chest, \"that I, Igor Jandorf,  will defeat the Machine by the living force of my human personality!  Already I have offered to play it an informal game blindfold\u2014I, who  have played 50 blindfold games simultaneously! Its owners refuse me. I  have challenged it also to a few games of rapid-transit\u2014an offer no  true grandmaster would dare ignore. Again they refuse me. I predict  that the Machine will play like a great oaf\u2014at least against me .  Repeat: I, Igor Jandorf, by the living force of my human personality,  will defeat the Machine. Do you have that? You can remember it?\"\n\n\n \"Oh yes,\" Sandra assured him, \"but there are some other questions I  very much want to ask you, Mr. Jandorf.\"\n\n\n \"I am sorry, Miss Grayling, but I must clear my mind now. In ten  minutes they start the clocks.\"\n\n\n While Sandra arranged for an interview with Jandorf after the day's  playing session, Doc reordered his coffee.\n\n\n \"One expects it of Jandorf,\" he explained to Sandra with a philosophic  shrug when the shock-headed man was gone. \"At least he didn't take your  wine-and-seltzer. Or did he? One tip I have for you: don't call a chess  master Mister, call him Master. They all eat it up.\"\n\n\n \"Gee, Doc, I don't know how to thank you for everything. I hope I  haven't offended Mis\u2014Master Jandorf so that he doesn't\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about that. Wild horses couldn't keep Jandorf away from a  press interview. You know, his rapid-transit challenge was cunning.  That's a minor variety of chess where each player gets only ten seconds  to make a move. Which I don't suppose would give the Machine time to  look three moves ahead. Chess players would say that the Machine has a  very slow sight of the board. This tournament is being played at the  usual international rate of 15 moves an hour, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is that why they've got all those crazy clocks?\" Sandra interrupted.\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. Chess clocks measure the time each player takes in making his  moves. When a player makes a move he presses a button that shuts his  clock off and turns his opponent's on. If a player uses too much time,  he loses as surely as if he were checkmated. Now since the Machine  will almost certainly be programmed to take an equal amount of time  on successive moves, a rate of 15 moves an hour means it will have 4  minutes a move\u2014and it will need every second of them! Incidentally  it was typical Jandorf bravado to make a point of a blindfold  challenge\u2014just as if the Machine weren't playing blindfold itself. Or is the Machine blindfold? How do you think of it?\"\n\n\n \"Gosh, I don't know. Say, Doc, is it really true that Master Jandorf  has played 50 games at once blindfolded? I can't believe that.\" \"Of course not!\" Doc assured her. \"It was only 49 and he lost two of  those and drew five. Jandorf always exaggerates. It's in his blood.\"\n\n\n \"He's one of the Russians, isn't he?\" Sandra asked. \"Igor?\"\n\n\n Doc chuckled. \"Not exactly,\" he said gently. \"He is originally a Pole  and now he has Argentinian citizenship. You have a program, don't you?\"\n\n\n Sandra started to hunt through her pocketbook, but just then two lists  of names lit up on the big electric scoreboard. THE PLAYERS William Angler, USA\n\n Bela Grabo, Hungary\n\n Ivan Jal, USSR\n\n Igor Jandorf, Argentina\n\n Dr. S.

Oh, he's the boy wonder,  isn't he?\"\n\n\n Doc nodded. \"Not such a boy any longer, though. He's.... Well, speak of  the Devil's children.... Miss Grayling, I have the honor of presenting  to you the only grandmaster ever to have been ex-chess-champion of the  United States while still technically a minor\u2014Master William Augustus  Angler.\"\n\n\n A tall, sharply-dressed young man with a hatchet face pressed the old  man back into his chair.\n\n\n \"How are you, Savvy, old boy old boy?\" he demanded. \"Still chasing the  girls, I see.\"\n\n\n \"Please, Willie, get off me.\"\n\n\n \"Can't take it, huh?\" Angler straightened up somewhat. \"Hey waiter!  Where's that chocolate malt? I don't want it next year. About that ex- , though. I was swindled, Savvy. I was robbed.\"\n\n\n \"Willie!\" Doc said with some asperity. \"Miss Grayling is a journalist.  She would like to have a statement from you as to how you will play  against the Machine.\" Angler grinned and shook his head sadly. \"Poor old Machine,\" he said.  \"I don't know why they take so much trouble polishing up that pile of  tin just so that I can give it a hit in the head. I got a hatful of  moves it'll burn out all its tubes trying to answer. And if it gets too  fresh, how about you and me giving its low-temperature section the  hotfoot, Savvy? The money WBM's putting up is okay, though. That first  prize will just fit the big hole in my bank account.\"\n\n\n \"I know you haven't the time now, Master Angler,\" Sandra said rapidly,  \"but if after the playing session you could grant me\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sorry, babe,\" Angler broke in with a wave of dismissal. \"I'm dated up  for two months in advance. Waiter! I'm here, not there!\" And he went  charging off.\n\n\n Doc and Sandra looked at each other and smiled.\n\n\n \"Chess masters aren't exactly humble people, are they?\" she said.\n\n\n Doc's smile became tinged with sad understanding. \"You must excuse  them, though,\" he said. \"They really get so little recognition or  recompense. This tournament is an exception. And it takes a great deal  of ego to play greatly.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so. So World Business Machines is responsible for this  tournament?\"\n\n\n \"Correct. Their advertising department is interested in the prestige.  They want to score a point over their great rival.\"\n\n\n \"But if the Machine plays badly it will be a black eye for them,\"  Sandra pointed out.\n\n\n \"True,\" Doc agreed thoughtfully. \"WBM must feel very sure.... It's  the prize money they've put up, of course, that's brought the world's  greatest players here. Otherwise half of them would be holding off  in the best temperamental-artist style. For chess players the prize  money is fabulous\u2014$35,000, with $15,000 for first place, and all  expenses paid for all players. There's never been anything like it.  Soviet Russia is the only country that has ever supported and rewarded  her best chess players at all adequately. I think the Russian players  are here because UNESCO and FIDE (that's Federation Internationale  des Echecs \u2014the international chess organization) are also backing  the tournament. And perhaps because the Kremlin is hungry for a little  prestige now that its space program is sagging.\"\n\n\n \"But if a Russian doesn't take first place it will be a black eye for  them.\"\n\n\n Doc frowned. \"True, in a sense. They must feel very sure.... Here  they are now.\" Four men were crossing the center of the hall, which was clearing,  toward the tables at the other end. Doubtless they just happened to be  going two by two in close formation, but it gave Sandra the feeling of  a phalanx.\n\n\n \"The first two are Lysmov and Votbinnik,\" Doc told her. \"It isn't often  that you see the current champion of the world\u2014Votbinnik\u2014and an  ex-champion arm in arm. There are two other persons in the tournament  who have held that honor\u2014Jal and Vanderhoef the director, way back.\"\n\n\n \"Will whoever wins this tournament become champion?\"\n\n\n \"Oh no. That's decided by two-player matches\u2014a very long  business\u2014after elimination tournaments between leading contenders.  This tournament is a round robin: each player plays one game with every  other player. That means nine rounds.\"\n\n\n \"Anyway there are an awful lot of Russians in the tournament,\"  Sandra said, consulting her program. \"Four out of ten have USSR after  them. And Bela Grabo, Hungary\u2014that's a satellite. And Sherevsky and  Krakatower are Russian-sounding names.\"\n\n\n \"The proportion of Soviet to American entries in the tournament  represents pretty fairly the general difference in playing strength  between the two countries,\" Doc said judiciously. \"Chess mastery  moves from land to land with the years. Way back it was the Moslems  and the Hindus and Persians. Then Italy and Spain. A little over a  hundred years ago it was France and England. Then Germany, Austria  and the New World. Now it's Russia\u2014including of course the Russians  who have run away from Russia. But don't think there aren't a lot of  good Anglo-Saxon types who are masters of the first water. In fact,  there are a lot of them here around us, though perhaps you don't  think so. It's just that if you play a lot of chess you get to looking  Russian. Once it probably made you look Italian. Do you see that short  bald-headed man?\"\n\n\n \"You mean the one facing the Machine and talking to Jandorf?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Now that's one with a lot of human interest. Moses Sherevsky.  Been champion of the United States many times. A very strict Orthodox  Jew. Can't play chess on Fridays or on Saturdays before sundown.\" He  chuckled. \"Why, there's even a story going around that one rabbi told  Sherevsky it would be unlawful for him to play against the Machine  because it is technically a golem \u2014the clay Frankenstein's monster of  Hebrew legend.\"\n\n\n Sandra asked, \"What about Grabo and Krakatower?\" Doc gave a short scornful laugh. \"Krakatower! Don't pay any attention  to him . A senile has-been, it's a scandal he's been allowed to play  in this tournament! He must have pulled all sorts of strings. Told them  that his lifelong services to chess had won him the honor and that they  had to have a member of the so-called Old Guard. Maybe he even got down  on his knees and cried\u2014and all the time his eyes on that expense money  and the last-place consolation prize! Yet dreaming schizophrenically  of beating them all! Please, don't get me started on Dirty Old  Krakatower.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Doc. He sounds like he would make an interesting  article? Can you point him out to me?\"\n\n\n \"You can tell him by his long white beard with coffee stains. I don't  see it anywhere, though. Perhaps he's shaved it off for the occasion.  It would be like that antique womanizer to develop senile delusions of  youthfulness.\"\n\n\n \"And Grabo?\" Sandra pressed, suppressing a smile at the intensity of  Doc's animosity.\n\n\n Doc's eyes grew thoughtful. \"About Bela Grabo (why are three out of  four Hungarians named Bela?) I will tell you only this: That he is a  very brilliant player and that the Machine is very lucky to have drawn  him as its first opponent.\"\n\n\n He would not amplify his statement. Sandra studied the Scoreboard again.\n\n\n \"This Simon Great who's down as programming the Machine. He's a famous  physicist, I suppose?\"\n\n\n \"By no means. That was the trouble with some of the early chess-playing  machines\u2014they were programmed by scientists. No, Simon Great is a  psychologist who at one time was a leading contender for the world's  chess championship. I think WBM was surprisingly shrewd to pick him  for the programming job. Let me tell you\u2014No, better yet\u2014\"\n\n\n Doc shot to his feet, stretched an arm on high and called out sharply,  \"Simon!\"\n\n\n A man some four tables away waved back and a moment later came over.\n\n\n \"What is it, Savilly?\" he asked. \"There's hardly any time, you know.\" The newcomer was of middle height, compact of figure and feature, with  graying hair cut short and combed sharply back.\n\n\n Doc spoke his piece for Sandra.\n\n\n Simon Great smiled thinly. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"But I am making no  predictions and we are giving out no advance information on the  programming of the Machine. As you know, I have had to fight the  Players' Committee tooth and nail on all sorts of points about that  and they have won most of them. I am not permitted to re-program the  Machine at adjournments\u2014only between games (I did insist on that and  get it!) And if the Machine breaks down during a game, its clock keeps  running on it. My men are permitted to make repairs\u2014if they can work  fast enough.\"\n\n\n \"That makes it very tough on you,\" Sandra put in. \"The Machine isn't  allowed any weaknesses.\"\n\n\n Great nodded soberly. \"And now I must go. They've almost finished the  count-down, as one of my technicians keeps on calling it. Very pleased  to have met you, Miss Grayling\u2014I'll check with our PR man on that  interview. Be seeing you, Savvy.\"\n\n\n The tiers of seats were filled now and the central space almost clear.  Officials were shooing off a few knots of lingerers. Several of the  grandmasters, including all four Russians, were seated at their tables.  Press and company cameras were flashing. The four smaller wallboards  lit up with the pieces in the opening position\u2014white for White and red  for Black. Simon Great stepped over the red velvet cord and more flash  bulbs went off.\n\n\n \"You know, Doc,\" Sandra said, \"I'm a dog to suggest this, but what  if this whole thing were a big fake? What if Simon Great were really  playing the Machine's moves? There would surely be some way for his  electricians to rig\u2014\"\n\n\n Doc laughed happily\u2014and so loudly that some people at the adjoining  tables frowned.\n\n\n \"Miss Grayling, that is a wonderful idea! I will probably steal it for  a short story. I still manage to write and place a few in England.  No, I do not think that is at all likely. WBM would never risk such  a fraud. Great is completely out of practice for actual tournament  play, though not for chess-thinking. The difference in style between  a computer and a man would be evident to any expert. Great's own style  is remembered and would be recognized\u2014though, come to think of it, his  style was often described as being machinelike....\" For a moment Doc's  eyes became thoughtful. Then he smiled again. \"But no, the idea is  impossible. Vanderhoef as Tournament Director has played two or three  games with the Machine to assure himself that it operates legitimately  and has grandmaster skill.\"\n\n\n \"Did the Machine beat him?\" Sandra asked. Doc shrugged. \"The scores weren't released. It was very hush-hush.  But about your idea, Miss Grayling\u2014did you ever read about Maelzel's  famous chess-playing automaton of the 19th Century? That one too was  supposed to work by machinery (cogs and gears, not electricity) but  actually it had a man hidden inside it\u2014your Edgar Poe exposed the  fraud in a famous article. In my story I think the chess robot will  break down while it is being demonstrated to a millionaire purchaser  and the young inventor will have to win its game for it to cover up  and swing the deal. Only the millionaire's daughter, who is really a  better player than either of them ... yes, yes! Your Ambrose Bierce  too wrote a story about a chess-playing robot of the clickety-clank-grr  kind who murdered his creator, crushing him like an iron grizzly bear  when the man won a game from him. Tell me, Miss Grayling, do you find  yourself imagining this Machine putting out angry tendrils to strangle  its opponents, or beaming rays of death and hypnotism at them? I can  imagine....\"\n\n\n While Doc chattered happily on about chess-playing robots and chess  stories, Sandra found herself thinking about him. A writer of some sort  evidently and a terrific chess buff. Perhaps he was an actual medical  doctor. She'd read something about two or three coming over with the  Russian squad. But Doc certainly didn't sound like a Soviet citizen.\n\n\n He was older than she'd first assumed. She could see that now that  she was listening to him less and looking at him more. Tired, too.  Only his dark-circled eyes shone with unquenchable youth. A useful old  guy, whoever he was. An hour ago she'd been sure she was going to muff  this assignment completely and now she had it laid out cold. For the  umpteenth time in her career Sandra shied away from the guilty thought  that she wasn't a writer at all or even a reporter, she just used  dime-a-dozen female attractiveness to rope a susceptible man (young,  old, American, Russian) and pick his brain....\n\n\n She realized suddenly that the whole hall had become very quiet.\n\n\n Doc was the only person still talking and people were again looking at  them disapprovingly. All five wallboards were lit up and the changed  position of a few pieces showed that opening moves had been made on  four of them, including the Machine's. The central space between  the tiers of seats was completely clear now, except for one man  hurrying across it in their direction with the rapid yet quiet, almost  tip-toe walk that seemed to mark all the officials. Like morticians'  assistants , she thought. He rapidly mounted the stairs and halted at  the top to look around searchingly. His gaze lighted on their table,  his eyebrows went up, and he made a beeline for Doc. Sandra wondered if  she should warn him that he was about to be shushed.\n\n\n The official laid a hand on Doc's shoulder. \"Sir!\" he said agitatedly.  \"Do you realize that they've started your clock, Dr. Krakatower?\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat statement would many of the chess players at the tournament NOT agree with?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Chess is a tedious game.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The Machine is impossible to win against.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The Machine is impossible to win against.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The Machine is impossible to win against.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It\n\n could be tricked. It could make\n\n mistakes. And\u2014it could learn!\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1962.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Silently, so as not to shock anyone with illusions about well dressed  young women, Sandra Lea Grayling cursed the day she had persuaded the Chicago Space Mirror that there would be all sorts of human interest  stories to be picked up at the first international grandmaster chess  tournament in which an electronic computing machine was entered.\n\n\n Not that there weren't enough humans around, it was the interest that  was in doubt. The large hall was crammed with energetic dark-suited  men of whom a disproportionately large number were bald, wore glasses,  were faintly untidy and indefinably shabby, had Slavic or Scandinavian  features, and talked foreign languages.\n\n\n They yakked interminably. The only ones who didn't were scurrying  individuals with the eager-zombie look of officials.\n\n\n Chess sets were everywhere\u2014big ones on tables, still bigger  diagram-type electric ones on walls, small peg-in sets dragged from  side pockets and manipulated rapidly as part of the conversational  ritual and still smaller folding sets in which the pieces were the tiny  magnetized disks used for playing in free-fall.\n\n\n There were signs featuring largely mysterious combinations of letters:  FIDE, WBM, USCF, USSF, USSR and UNESCO. Sandra felt fairly sure about  the last three.\n\n\n The many clocks, bedside table size, would have struck a familiar  note except that they had little red flags and wheels sprinkled over  their faces and they were all in pairs, two clocks to a case. That  Siamese-twin clocks should be essential to a chess tournament struck  Sandra as a particularly maddening circumstance. Her last assignment had been to interview the pilot pair riding the  first American manned circum-lunar satellite\u2014and the five alternate  pairs who hadn't made the flight. This tournament hall seemed to Sandra  much further out of the world.\n\n\n Overheard scraps of conversation in reasonably intelligible English  were not particularly helpful. Samples:\n\n\n \"They say the Machine has been programmed to play nothing but pure  Barcza System and Indian Defenses\u2014and the Dragon Formation if anyone  pushes the King Pawn.\"\n\n\n \"Hah! In that case....\"\n\n\n \"The Russians have come with ten trunkfuls of prepared variations and  they'll gang up on the Machine at adjournments. What can one New Jersey  computer do against four Russian grandmasters?\"\n\n\n \"I heard the Russians have been programmed\u2014with hypnotic cramming and  somno-briefing. Votbinnik had a nervous breakdown.\"\n\n\n \"Why, the Machine hasn't even a Haupturnier or an intercollegiate  won. It'll over its head be playing.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, but maybe like Capa at San Sebastian or Morphy or Willie Angler  at New York. The Russians will look like potzers.\"\n\n\n \"Have you studied the scores of the match between Moon Base and  Circum-Terra?\"\n\n\n \"Not worth the trouble. The play was feeble. Barely Expert Rating.\"\n\n\n Sandra's chief difficulty was that she knew absolutely nothing about  the game of chess\u2014a point that she had slid over in conferring with  the powers at the Space Mirror , but that now had begun to weigh on  her. How wonderful it would be, she dreamed, to walk out this minute,  find a quiet bar and get pie-eyed in an evil, ladylike way. \"Perhaps mademoiselle would welcome a drink?\"\n\n\n \"You're durn tootin' she would!\" Sandra replied in a rush, and then  looked down apprehensively at the person who had read her thoughts.\n\n\n It was a small sprightly elderly man who looked like a somewhat  thinned down Peter Lorre\u2014there was that same impression of the happy  Slavic elf. What was left of his white hair was cut very short,  making a silvery nap. His pince-nez had quite thick lenses. But in  sharp contrast to the somberly clad men around them, he was wearing  a pearl-gray suit of almost exactly the same shade as Sandra's\u2014a  circumstance that created for her the illusion that they were fellow  conspirators.\n\n\n \"Hey, wait a minute,\" she protested just the same. He had already taken  her arm and was piloting her toward the nearest flight of low wide  stairs. \"How did you know I wanted a drink?\"\n\n\n \"I could see that mademoiselle was having difficulty swallowing,\" he  replied, keeping them moving. \"Pardon me for feasting my eyes on your  lovely throat.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't suppose they'd serve drinks here.\"\n\n\n \"But of course.\" They were already mounting the stairs. \"What would  chess be without coffee or schnapps?\"\n\n\n \"Okay, lead on,\" Sandra said. \"You're the doctor.\"\n\n\n \"Doctor?\" He smiled widely. \"You know, I like being called that.\"\n\n\n \"Then the name is yours as long as you want it\u2014Doc.\" Meanwhile the happy little man had edged them into the first of a small  cluster of tables, where a dark-suited jabbering trio was just rising.  He snapped his fingers and hissed through his teeth. A white-aproned  waiter materialized.\n\n\n \"For myself black coffee,\" he said. \"For mademoiselle rhine wine and  seltzer?\"\n\n\n \"That'd go fine.\" Sandra leaned back. \"Confidentially, Doc, I was  having trouble swallowing ... well, just about everything here.\"\n\n\n He nodded. \"You are not the first to be shocked and horrified by  chess,\" he assured her. \"It is a curse of the intellect. It is a game  for lunatics\u2014or else it creates them. But what brings a sane and  beautiful young lady to this 64-square madhouse?\"\n\n\n Sandra briefly told him her story and her predicament. By the time they  were served, Doc had absorbed the one and assessed the other.\n\n\n \"You have one great advantage,\" he told her. \"You know nothing  whatsoever of chess\u2014so you will be able to write about it  understandably for your readers.\" He swallowed half his demitasse and  smacked his lips. \"As for the Machine\u2014you do know, I suppose, that  it is not a humanoid metal robot, walking about clanking and squeaking  like a late medieval knight in armor?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Doc, but....\" Sandra found difficulty in phrasing the question.\n\n\n \"Wait.\" He lifted a finger. \"I think I know what you're going to ask.  You want to know why, if the Machine works at all, it doesn't work  perfectly, so that it always wins and there is no contest. Right?\"\n\n\n Sandra grinned and nodded. Doc's ability to interpret her mind was as  comforting as the bubbly, mildly astringent mixture she was sipping.\n\n\n He removed his pince-nez, massaged the bridge of his nose and replaced  them.\n\n\n \"If you had,\" he said, \"a billion computers all as fast as the Machine,  it would take them all the time there ever will be in the universe just  to play through all the possible games of chess, not to mention the  time needed to classify those games into branching families of wins for  White, wins for Black and draws, and the additional time required to  trace out chains of key-moves leading always to wins. So the Machine  can't play chess like God. What the Machine can do is examine all the  likely lines of play for about eight moves ahead\u2014that is, four moves  each for White and Black\u2014and then decide which is the best move on the  basis of capturing enemy pieces, working toward checkmate, establishing  a powerful central position and so on.\" \"That sounds like the way a man would play a game,\" Sandra observed.  \"Look ahead a little way and try to make a plan. You know, like getting  out trumps in bridge or setting up a finesse.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" Doc beamed at her approvingly. \"The Machine is like a  man. A rather peculiar and not exactly pleasant man. A man who always  abides by sound principles, who is utterly incapable of flights of  genius, but who never makes a mistake. You see, you are finding human  interest already, even in the Machine.\"\n\n\n Sandra nodded. \"Does a human chess player\u2014a grandmaster, I mean\u2014ever  look eight moves ahead in a game?\"\n\n\n \"Most assuredly he does! In crucial situations, say where there's a  chance of winning at once by trapping the enemy king, he examines  many more moves ahead than that\u2014thirty or forty even. The Machine  is probably programmed to recognize such situations and do something  of the same sort, though we can't be sure from the information World  Business Machines has released. But in most chess positions the  possibilities are so very nearly unlimited that even a grandmaster can  only look a very few moves ahead and must rely on his judgment and  experience and artistry. The equivalent of those in the Machine is the  directions fed into it before it plays a game.\"\n\n\n \"You mean the programming?\"\n\n\n \"Indeed yes! The programming is the crux of the problem of the  chess-playing computer. The first practical model, reported by  Bernstein and Roberts of IBM in 1958 and which looked four moves  ahead, was programmed so that it had a greedy worried tendency to grab  at enemy pieces and to retreat its own whenever they were attacked. It  had a personality like that of a certain kind of chess-playing dub\u2014a  dull-brained woodpusher afraid to take the slightest risk of losing  material\u2014but a dub who could almost always beat an utter novice.  The WBM machine here in the hall operates about a million times as  fast. Don't ask me how, I'm no physicist, but it depends on the new  transistors and something they call hypervelocity, which in turn  depends on keeping parts of the Machine at a temperature near absolute  zero. However, the result is that the Machine can see eight moves ahead  and is capable of being programmed much more craftily.\"\n\n\n \"A million times as fast as the first machine, you say, Doc? And yet it  only sees twice as many moves ahead?\" Sandra objected.\n\n\n \"There is a geometrical progression involved there,\" he told her  with a smile. \"Believe me, eight moves ahead is a lot of moves when  you remember that the Machine is errorlessly examining every one of  thousands of variations. Flesh-and-blood chess masters have lost games  by blunders they could have avoided by looking only one or two moves  ahead. The Machine will make no such oversights. Once again, you see,  you have the human factor, in this case working for the Machine.\"\n\n\n \"Savilly, I have been looking allplace for you!\"\n\n\n A stocky, bull-faced man with a great bristling shock of black,  gray-flecked hair had halted abruptly by their table. He bent over Doc  and began to whisper explosively in a guttural foreign tongue. Sandra's gaze traveled beyond the balustrade. Now that she could look  down at it, the central hall seemed less confusedly crowded. In the  middle, toward the far end, were five small tables spaced rather widely  apart and with a chessboard and men and one of the Siamese clocks set  out on each. To either side of the hall were tiers of temporary seats,  about half of them occupied. There were at least as many more people  still wandering about.\n\n\n On the far wall was a big electric scoreboard and also, above the  corresponding tables, five large dully glassy chessboards, the White  squares in light gray, the Black squares in dark.\n\n\n One of the five wall chessboards was considerably larger than the other  four\u2014the one above the Machine.\n\n\n Sandra looked with quickening interest at the console of the Machine\u2014a  bank of keys and some half-dozen panels of rows and rows of tiny  telltale lights, all dark at the moment. A thick red velvet cord on  little brass standards ran around the Machine at a distance of about  ten feet. Inside the cord were only a few gray-smocked men. Two of  them had just laid a black cable to the nearest chess table and were  attaching it to the Siamese clock.\n\n\n Sandra tried to think of a being who always checked everything, but  only within limits beyond which his thoughts never ventured, and who  never made a mistake....\n\n\n \"Miss Grayling! May I present to you Igor Jandorf.\"\n\n\n She turned back quickly with a smile and a nod.\n\n\n \"I should tell you, Igor,\" Doc continued, \"that Miss Grayling  represents a large and influential Midwestern newspaper. Perhaps you  have a message for her readers.\"\n\n\n The shock-headed man's eyes flashed. \"I most certainly do!\" At that  moment the waiter arrived with a second coffee and wine-and-seltzer.  Jandorf seized Doc's new demitasse, drained it, set it back on the tray  with a flourish and drew himself up. \"Tell your readers, Miss Grayling,\" he proclaimed, fiercely arching his  eyebrows at her and actually slapping his chest, \"that I, Igor Jandorf,  will defeat the Machine by the living force of my human personality!  Already I have offered to play it an informal game blindfold\u2014I, who  have played 50 blindfold games simultaneously! Its owners refuse me. I  have challenged it also to a few games of rapid-transit\u2014an offer no  true grandmaster would dare ignore. Again they refuse me. I predict  that the Machine will play like a great oaf\u2014at least against me .  Repeat: I, Igor Jandorf, by the living force of my human personality,  will defeat the Machine. Do you have that? You can remember it?\"\n\n\n \"Oh yes,\" Sandra assured him, \"but there are some other questions I  very much want to ask you, Mr. Jandorf.\"\n\n\n \"I am sorry, Miss Grayling, but I must clear my mind now. In ten  minutes they start the clocks.\"\n\n\n While Sandra arranged for an interview with Jandorf after the day's  playing session, Doc reordered his coffee.\n\n\n \"One expects it of Jandorf,\" he explained to Sandra with a philosophic  shrug when the shock-headed man was gone. \"At least he didn't take your  wine-and-seltzer. Or did he? One tip I have for you: don't call a chess  master Mister, call him Master. They all eat it up.\"\n\n\n \"Gee, Doc, I don't know how to thank you for everything. I hope I  haven't offended Mis\u2014Master Jandorf so that he doesn't\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about that. Wild horses couldn't keep Jandorf away from a  press interview. You know, his rapid-transit challenge was cunning.  That's a minor variety of chess where each player gets only ten seconds  to make a move. Which I don't suppose would give the Machine time to  look three moves ahead. Chess players would say that the Machine has a  very slow sight of the board. This tournament is being played at the  usual international rate of 15 moves an hour, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is that why they've got all those crazy clocks?\" Sandra interrupted.\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. Chess clocks measure the time each player takes in making his  moves. When a player makes a move he presses a button that shuts his  clock off and turns his opponent's on. If a player uses too much time,  he loses as surely as if he were checkmated. Now since the Machine  will almost certainly be programmed to take an equal amount of time  on successive moves, a rate of 15 moves an hour means it will have 4  minutes a move\u2014and it will need every second of them! Incidentally  it was typical Jandorf bravado to make a point of a blindfold  challenge\u2014just as if the Machine weren't playing blindfold itself. Or is the Machine blindfold? How do you think of it?\"\n\n\n \"Gosh, I don't know. Say, Doc, is it really true that Master Jandorf  has played 50 games at once blindfolded? I can't believe that.\" \"Of course not!\" Doc assured her. \"It was only 49 and he lost two of  those and drew five. Jandorf always exaggerates. It's in his blood.\"\n\n\n \"He's one of the Russians, isn't he?\" Sandra asked. \"Igor?\"\n\n\n Doc chuckled. \"Not exactly,\" he said gently. \"He is originally a Pole  and now he has Argentinian citizenship. You have a program, don't you?\"\n\n\n Sandra started to hunt through her pocketbook, but just then two lists  of names lit up on the big electric scoreboard. THE PLAYERS William Angler, USA\n\n Bela Grabo, Hungary\n\n Ivan Jal, USSR\n\n Igor Jandorf, Argentina\n\n Dr. S.

Oh, he's the boy wonder,  isn't he?\"\n\n\n Doc nodded. \"Not such a boy any longer, though. He's.... Well, speak of  the Devil's children.... Miss Grayling, I have the honor of presenting  to you the only grandmaster ever to have been ex-chess-champion of the  United States while still technically a minor\u2014Master William Augustus  Angler.\"\n\n\n A tall, sharply-dressed young man with a hatchet face pressed the old  man back into his chair.\n\n\n \"How are you, Savvy, old boy old boy?\" he demanded. \"Still chasing the  girls, I see.\"\n\n\n \"Please, Willie, get off me.\"\n\n\n \"Can't take it, huh?\" Angler straightened up somewhat. \"Hey waiter!  Where's that chocolate malt? I don't want it next year. About that ex- , though. I was swindled, Savvy. I was robbed.\"\n\n\n \"Willie!\" Doc said with some asperity. \"Miss Grayling is a journalist.  She would like to have a statement from you as to how you will play  against the Machine.\" Angler grinned and shook his head sadly. \"Poor old Machine,\" he said.  \"I don't know why they take so much trouble polishing up that pile of  tin just so that I can give it a hit in the head. I got a hatful of  moves it'll burn out all its tubes trying to answer. And if it gets too  fresh, how about you and me giving its low-temperature section the  hotfoot, Savvy? The money WBM's putting up is okay, though. That first  prize will just fit the big hole in my bank account.\"\n\n\n \"I know you haven't the time now, Master Angler,\" Sandra said rapidly,  \"but if after the playing session you could grant me\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sorry, babe,\" Angler broke in with a wave of dismissal. \"I'm dated up  for two months in advance. Waiter! I'm here, not there!\" And he went  charging off.\n\n\n Doc and Sandra looked at each other and smiled.\n\n\n \"Chess masters aren't exactly humble people, are they?\" she said.\n\n\n Doc's smile became tinged with sad understanding. \"You must excuse  them, though,\" he said. \"They really get so little recognition or  recompense. This tournament is an exception. And it takes a great deal  of ego to play greatly.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so. So World Business Machines is responsible for this  tournament?\"\n\n\n \"Correct. Their advertising department is interested in the prestige.  They want to score a point over their great rival.\"\n\n\n \"But if the Machine plays badly it will be a black eye for them,\"  Sandra pointed out.\n\n\n \"True,\" Doc agreed thoughtfully. \"WBM must feel very sure.... It's  the prize money they've put up, of course, that's brought the world's  greatest players here. Otherwise half of them would be holding off  in the best temperamental-artist style. For chess players the prize  money is fabulous\u2014$35,000, with $15,000 for first place, and all  expenses paid for all players. There's never been anything like it.  Soviet Russia is the only country that has ever supported and rewarded  her best chess players at all adequately. I think the Russian players  are here because UNESCO and FIDE (that's Federation Internationale  des Echecs \u2014the international chess organization) are also backing  the tournament. And perhaps because the Kremlin is hungry for a little  prestige now that its space program is sagging.\"\n\n\n \"But if a Russian doesn't take first place it will be a black eye for  them.\"\n\n\n Doc frowned. \"True, in a sense. They must feel very sure.... Here  they are now.\" Four men were crossing the center of the hall, which was clearing,  toward the tables at the other end. Doubtless they just happened to be  going two by two in close formation, but it gave Sandra the feeling of  a phalanx.\n\n\n \"The first two are Lysmov and Votbinnik,\" Doc told her. \"It isn't often  that you see the current champion of the world\u2014Votbinnik\u2014and an  ex-champion arm in arm. There are two other persons in the tournament  who have held that honor\u2014Jal and Vanderhoef the director, way back.\"\n\n\n \"Will whoever wins this tournament become champion?\"\n\n\n \"Oh no. That's decided by two-player matches\u2014a very long  business\u2014after elimination tournaments between leading contenders.  This tournament is a round robin: each player plays one game with every  other player. That means nine rounds.\"\n\n\n \"Anyway there are an awful lot of Russians in the tournament,\"  Sandra said, consulting her program. \"Four out of ten have USSR after  them. And Bela Grabo, Hungary\u2014that's a satellite. And Sherevsky and  Krakatower are Russian-sounding names.\"\n\n\n \"The proportion of Soviet to American entries in the tournament  represents pretty fairly the general difference in playing strength  between the two countries,\" Doc said judiciously. \"Chess mastery  moves from land to land with the years. Way back it was the Moslems  and the Hindus and Persians. Then Italy and Spain. A little over a  hundred years ago it was France and England. Then Germany, Austria  and the New World. Now it's Russia\u2014including of course the Russians  who have run away from Russia. But don't think there aren't a lot of  good Anglo-Saxon types who are masters of the first water. In fact,  there are a lot of them here around us, though perhaps you don't  think so. It's just that if you play a lot of chess you get to looking  Russian. Once it probably made you look Italian. Do you see that short  bald-headed man?\"\n\n\n \"You mean the one facing the Machine and talking to Jandorf?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Now that's one with a lot of human interest. Moses Sherevsky.  Been champion of the United States many times. A very strict Orthodox  Jew. Can't play chess on Fridays or on Saturdays before sundown.\" He  chuckled. \"Why, there's even a story going around that one rabbi told  Sherevsky it would be unlawful for him to play against the Machine  because it is technically a golem \u2014the clay Frankenstein's monster of  Hebrew legend.\"\n\n\n Sandra asked, \"What about Grabo and Krakatower?\" Doc gave a short scornful laugh. \"Krakatower! Don't pay any attention  to him . A senile has-been, it's a scandal he's been allowed to play  in this tournament! He must have pulled all sorts of strings. Told them  that his lifelong services to chess had won him the honor and that they  had to have a member of the so-called Old Guard. Maybe he even got down  on his knees and cried\u2014and all the time his eyes on that expense money  and the last-place consolation prize! Yet dreaming schizophrenically  of beating them all! Please, don't get me started on Dirty Old  Krakatower.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Doc. He sounds like he would make an interesting  article? Can you point him out to me?\"\n\n\n \"You can tell him by his long white beard with coffee stains. I don't  see it anywhere, though. Perhaps he's shaved it off for the occasion.  It would be like that antique womanizer to develop senile delusions of  youthfulness.\"\n\n\n \"And Grabo?\" Sandra pressed, suppressing a smile at the intensity of  Doc's animosity.\n\n\n Doc's eyes grew thoughtful. \"About Bela Grabo (why are three out of  four Hungarians named Bela?) I will tell you only this: That he is a  very brilliant player and that the Machine is very lucky to have drawn  him as its first opponent.\"\n\n\n He would not amplify his statement. Sandra studied the Scoreboard again.\n\n\n \"This Simon Great who's down as programming the Machine. He's a famous  physicist, I suppose?\"\n\n\n \"By no means. That was the trouble with some of the early chess-playing  machines\u2014they were programmed by scientists. No, Simon Great is a  psychologist who at one time was a leading contender for the world's  chess championship. I think WBM was surprisingly shrewd to pick him  for the programming job. Let me tell you\u2014No, better yet\u2014\"\n\n\n Doc shot to his feet, stretched an arm on high and called out sharply,  \"Simon!\"\n\n\n A man some four tables away waved back and a moment later came over.\n\n\n \"What is it, Savilly?\" he asked. \"There's hardly any time, you know.\" The newcomer was of middle height, compact of figure and feature, with  graying hair cut short and combed sharply back.\n\n\n Doc spoke his piece for Sandra.\n\n\n Simon Great smiled thinly. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"But I am making no  predictions and we are giving out no advance information on the  programming of the Machine. As you know, I have had to fight the  Players' Committee tooth and nail on all sorts of points about that  and they have won most of them. I am not permitted to re-program the  Machine at adjournments\u2014only between games (I did insist on that and  get it!) And if the Machine breaks down during a game, its clock keeps  running on it. My men are permitted to make repairs\u2014if they can work  fast enough.\"\n\n\n \"That makes it very tough on you,\" Sandra put in. \"The Machine isn't  allowed any weaknesses.\"\n\n\n Great nodded soberly. \"And now I must go. They've almost finished the  count-down, as one of my technicians keeps on calling it. Very pleased  to have met you, Miss Grayling\u2014I'll check with our PR man on that  interview. Be seeing you, Savvy.\"\n\n\n The tiers of seats were filled now and the central space almost clear.  Officials were shooing off a few knots of lingerers. Several of the  grandmasters, including all four Russians, were seated at their tables.  Press and company cameras were flashing. The four smaller wallboards  lit up with the pieces in the opening position\u2014white for White and red  for Black. Simon Great stepped over the red velvet cord and more flash  bulbs went off.\n\n\n \"You know, Doc,\" Sandra said, \"I'm a dog to suggest this, but what  if this whole thing were a big fake? What if Simon Great were really  playing the Machine's moves? There would surely be some way for his  electricians to rig\u2014\"\n\n\n Doc laughed happily\u2014and so loudly that some people at the adjoining  tables frowned.\n\n\n \"Miss Grayling, that is a wonderful idea! I will probably steal it for  a short story. I still manage to write and place a few in England.  No, I do not think that is at all likely. WBM would never risk such  a fraud. Great is completely out of practice for actual tournament  play, though not for chess-thinking. The difference in style between  a computer and a man would be evident to any expert. Great's own style  is remembered and would be recognized\u2014though, come to think of it, his  style was often described as being machinelike....\" For a moment Doc's  eyes became thoughtful. Then he smiled again. \"But no, the idea is  impossible. Vanderhoef as Tournament Director has played two or three  games with the Machine to assure himself that it operates legitimately  and has grandmaster skill.\"\n\n\n \"Did the Machine beat him?\" Sandra asked. Doc shrugged. \"The scores weren't released. It was very hush-hush.  But about your idea, Miss Grayling\u2014did you ever read about Maelzel's  famous chess-playing automaton of the 19th Century? That one too was  supposed to work by machinery (cogs and gears, not electricity) but  actually it had a man hidden inside it\u2014your Edgar Poe exposed the  fraud in a famous article. In my story I think the chess robot will  break down while it is being demonstrated to a millionaire purchaser  and the young inventor will have to win its game for it to cover up  and swing the deal. Only the millionaire's daughter, who is really a  better player than either of them ... yes, yes! Your Ambrose Bierce  too wrote a story about a chess-playing robot of the clickety-clank-grr  kind who murdered his creator, crushing him like an iron grizzly bear  when the man won a game from him. Tell me, Miss Grayling, do you find  yourself imagining this Machine putting out angry tendrils to strangle  its opponents, or beaming rays of death and hypnotism at them? I can  imagine....\"\n\n\n While Doc chattered happily on about chess-playing robots and chess  stories, Sandra found herself thinking about him. A writer of some sort  evidently and a terrific chess buff. Perhaps he was an actual medical  doctor. She'd read something about two or three coming over with the  Russian squad. But Doc certainly didn't sound like a Soviet citizen.\n\n\n He was older than she'd first assumed. She could see that now that  she was listening to him less and looking at him more. Tired, too.  Only his dark-circled eyes shone with unquenchable youth. A useful old  guy, whoever he was. An hour ago she'd been sure she was going to muff  this assignment completely and now she had it laid out cold. For the  umpteenth time in her career Sandra shied away from the guilty thought  that she wasn't a writer at all or even a reporter, she just used  dime-a-dozen female attractiveness to rope a susceptible man (young,  old, American, Russian) and pick his brain....\n\n\n She realized suddenly that the whole hall had become very quiet.\n\n\n Doc was the only person still talking and people were again looking at  them disapprovingly. All five wallboards were lit up and the changed  position of a few pieces showed that opening moves had been made on  four of them, including the Machine's. The central space between  the tiers of seats was completely clear now, except for one man  hurrying across it in their direction with the rapid yet quiet, almost  tip-toe walk that seemed to mark all the officials. Like morticians'  assistants , she thought. He rapidly mounted the stairs and halted at  the top to look around searchingly. His gaze lighted on their table,  his eyebrows went up, and he made a beeline for Doc. Sandra wondered if  she should warn him that he was about to be shushed.\n\n\n The official laid a hand on Doc's shoulder. \"Sir!\" he said agitatedly.  \"Do you realize that they've started your clock, Dr. Krakatower?\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat statement would many of the chess players at the tournament NOT agree with?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Chess is a tedious game.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The Machine is impossible to win against.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The Machine is impossible to win against.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The Machine is impossible to win against.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
