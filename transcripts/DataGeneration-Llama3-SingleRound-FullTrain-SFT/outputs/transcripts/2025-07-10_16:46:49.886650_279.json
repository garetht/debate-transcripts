      "background_text": "Every writer must seek his own Flowery Kingdom in imagination's wide  demesne, and if that search can begin and end on Earth his problem has  been greatly simplified. In post-war Japan Walt Sheldon has found not only  serenity, but complete freedom to write undisturbed about the things he  treasures most. A one-time Air Force officer, he has turned to fantasy in  his lighter moments, to bring us such brightly sparkling little gems as this. houlihan's   equation by ... Walt Sheldon The tiny spaceship had been built for a journey to a star. But its  small, mischievous pilots had a rendezvous with destiny\u2014on Earth. I\u00a0must  admit that at first I  wasn't sure I was hearing those  noises. It was in a park near the  nuclear propulsion center\u2014a cool,  green spot, with the leaves all telling  each other to hush, be quiet,  and the soft breeze stirring them up  again. I had known precisely such  a secluded little green sanctuary just  over the hill from Mr. Riordan's  farm when I was a boy.\n\n\n Now it was a place I came to  when I had a problem to thrash out.  That morning I had been trying to  work out an equation to give the  coefficient of discharge for the matter  in combustion. You may call it  gas, if you wish, for we treated it  like gas at the center for convenience\u2014as  it came from the rocket  tubes in our engine.\n\n\n Without this coefficient to give  us control, we would have lacked a  workable equation when we set  about putting the first moon rocket  around those extraordinary engines  of ours, which were still in the undeveloped  blueprint stage.\n\n\n I see I shall have to explain this,  although I had hoped to get right  along with my story. When you  start from scratch, matter discharged  from any orifice has a velocity directly  proportional to the square  root of the pressure-head driving it.  But when you actually put things  together, contractions or expansions  in the gas, surface roughness  and other factors make the velocity  a bit smaller.\n\n\n At the terrible discharge speed  of nuclear explosion\u2014which is  what the drive amounts to despite  the fact that it is simply water in  which nuclear salts have been previously  dissolved\u2014this small factor  makes quite a difference. I had  to figure everything into it\u2014diameter  of the nozzle, sharpness of the  edge, the velocity of approach to the  point of discharge, atomic weight  and structure\u2014 Oh, there is so  much of this that if you're not a  nuclear engineer yourself it's certain  to weary you.\n\n\n Perhaps you had better take my  word for it that without this equation\u2014correctly  stated, mind you\u2014mankind  would be well advised not  to make a first trip to the moon.  And all this talk of coefficients and  equations sits strangely, you might  say, upon the tongue of a man  named Kevin Francis Houlihan.  But I am, after all, a scientist. If I  had not been a specialist in my field  I would hardly have found myself  engaged in vital research at the  center.\n\n\n Anyway, I heard these little  noises in the park. They sounded  like small working sounds, blending  in eerily mysterious fashion with a  chorus of small voices. I thought at  first it might be children at play,  but then at the time I was a bit  absent-minded. I tiptoed to the edge  of the trees, not wanting to deprive  any small scalawags of their pleasure,  and peered out between the  branches. And what do you suppose  I saw? Not children, but a  group of little people, hard at work.\n\n\n There was a leader, an older one  with a crank face. He was beating  the air with his arms and piping:  \"Over here, now! All right, bring  those electrical connections over  here\u2014and see you're not slow as  treacle about it!\"\n\n\n There were perhaps fifty of the  little people. I was more than startled  by it, too. I had not seen little  people in\u2014oh, close to thirty years.  I had seen them first as a boy of  eight, and then, very briefly again,  on my tenth birthday. And I had  become convinced they could never be seen here in America. I had  never seen them so busy, either.  They were building something in  the middle of the glade. It was long  and shiny and upright and a little  over five feet in height.\n\n\n \"Come along now, people!\" said  this crotchety one, looking straight  at me. \"Stop starin' and get to  work! You'll not be needin' to  mind that man standin' there! You  know he can't see nor hear us!\"\n\n\n Oh, it was good to hear the rich  old tongue again. I smiled, and the  foreman of the leprechauns\u2014if  that's what he was\u2014saw me smile  and became stiff and alert for a moment,  as though suspecting that perhaps  I actually could see him. Then  he shrugged and turned away, clearly  deeming such a thing impossible.\n\n\n I said, \"Just a minute, friend,  and I'll beg your pardon. It so happens  I can see you.\"\n\n\n He whirled to face me again,  staring open-mouthed. Then he  said, \"What? What's that, now?\"\n\n\n \"I can see you,\" I said.\n\n\n \"Ohhh!\" he said and put his  palms to his cheekbones. \"Saints be  with us! He's a believer! Run everybody\u2014run  for your lives!\"\n\n\n And they all began running, in  as many directions as there were  little souls. They began to scurry  behind the trees and bushes, and a  sloping embankment nearby.\n\n\n \"No, wait!\" I said. \"Don't go  away! I'll not be hurting you!\"\n\n\n They continued to scurry.\n\n\n I knew what it was they feared.  \"I don't intend catching one of  you!\" I said. \"Come back, you daft  little creatures!\"\n\n\n But the glade was silent, and they  had all disappeared. They thought I  wanted their crock of gold, of  course. I'd be entitled to it if I could  catch one and keep him. Or so the  legends affirmed, though I've wondered  often about the truth of them.  But I was after no gold. I only wanted  to hear the music of an Irish  tongue. I was lonely here in America,  even if I had latched on to a fine  job of work for almost shamefully  generous pay. You see, in a place as  full of science as the nuclear propulsion  center there is not much  time for the old things. I very much  wanted to talk to the little people.\n\n\n I walked over to the center of  the glade where the curious shiny  object was standing. It was as  smooth as glass and shaped like a  huge cigar. There were a pair of  triangular fins down at the bottom,  and stubby wings amidships. Of  course it was a spaceship, or a  miniature replica of one. I looked  at it more closely. Everything seemed  almost miraculously complete  and workable.\n\n\n I shook my head in wonder, then  stepped back from the spaceship  and looked about the glade. I knew  they were all hiding nearby, watching  me apprehensively. I lifted my  head to them.\n\n\n \"Listen to me now, little people!\"  I called out. \"My name's  Houlihan of the Roscommon Houlihans.  I am descended from King  Niall himself\u2014or so at least my  father used to say! Come on out  now, and pass the time o' day!\"\n\n\n Then I waited, but they didn't  answer. The little people always  had been shy. Yet without reaching  a decision in so many words I knew  suddenly that I had to talk to them.  I'd come to the glen to work out a  knotty problem, and I was up  against a blank wall. Simply because  I was so lonely that my mind had  become clogged.\n\n\n I knew that if I could just once  hear the old tongue again, and talk  about the old things, I might be able  to think the problem through to a  satisfactory conclusion.\n\n\n So I stepped back to the tiny  spaceship, and this time I struck it  a resounding blow with my fist.  \"Hear me now, little people! If you  don't show yourselves and come out  and talk to me, I'll wreck this spaceship  from stem to stern!\" I heard only the leaves rustling  softly.\n\n\n \"Do you understand? I'll give  you until I count three to make an  appearance! One!\"\n\n\n The glade remained deathly silent.\n\n\n \"Two!\"\n\n\n I thought I heard a stirring somewhere,  as if a small, brittle twig had  snapped in the underbrush.\n\n\n \" Three! \"\n\n\n And with that the little people  suddenly appeared.\n\n\n The leader\u2014he seemed more  wizened and bent than before\u2014approached  me slowly and warily as I  stood there. The others all followed  at a safe distance. I smiled to reassure  them and then waved my arm  in a friendly gesture of greeting.\n\n\n \"Good morning,\" I said.\n\n\n \"Good morning,\" the foreman  said with some caution. \"My name  is Keech.\"\n\n\n \"And mine's Houlihan, as I've  told you. Are you convinced now  that I have no intention of doing  you any injury?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Houlihan,\" said Keech,  drawing a kind of peppered dignity  up about himself, \"in such matters  I am never fully convinced. After  living for many centuries I am all  too acutely aware of the perversity  of human nature.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"Well, as you will  quickly see, all I want to do is  talk.\" I nodded as I spoke, and sat  down cross-legged upon the grass.\n\n\n \"Any Irishman wants to talk, Mr.  Houlihan.\"\n\n\n \"And often that's all he wants,\"  I said. \"Sit down with me now, and  stop staring as if I were a snake  returned to the Island.\"\n\n\n He shook his head and remained  standing. \"Have your say, Mr.  Houlihan. And afterward we'll appreciate  it if you'll go away and  leave us to our work.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now, your work,\" I said,  and glanced at the spaceship.  \"That's exactly what's got me curious.\"\n\n\n The others had edged in a bit  now and were standing in a circle,  intently staring at me. I took out my  pipe. \"Why,\" I asked, \"would a  group of little people be building a  spaceship here in America\u2014out in  this lonely place?\"\n\n\n Keech stared back without much  expression, and said, \"I've been  wondering how you guessed it was  a spaceship. I was surprised enough  when you told me you could see us  but not overwhelmingly so. I've run  into believers before who could see  the little people. It happens every  so often, though not as frequently  as it did a century ago. But knowing  a spaceship at first glance! Well, I  must confess that does astonish  me.\"\n\n\n \"And why wouldn't I know a  spaceship when I see one?\" I said.  \"It just so happens I'm a doctor of  science.\"\n\n\n \"A doctor of science, now,\" said  Keech.\n\n\n \"Invited by the American government  to work on the first moon  rocket here at the nuclear propulsion  center. Since it's no secret I  can advise you of it.\"\n\n\n \"A scientist, is it,\" said Keech.  \"Well, now, that's very interesting.\"\n\n\n \"I'll make no apologies for it,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Oh, there's no need for apology,\"  said Keech. \"Though in truth  we prefer poets to scientists. But it  has just now crossed my mind, Mr.  Houlihan that you, being a scientist,  might be of help to us.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" I asked.\n\n\n \"Well, I might try starting at the  beginning,\" he replied.\n\n\n \"You might,\" I said. \"A man  usually does.\"\n\n\n Keech took out his own pipe\u2014a  clay dudeen\u2014and looked hopeful.  I gave him a pinch of tobacco from  my pouch. \"Well, now,\" he said,  \"first of all you're no doubt surprised  to find us here in America.\"\n\n\n \"I am surprised from time to  time to find myself here,\" I said.  \"But continue.\"\n\n\n \"We had to come here,\" said  Keech, \"to learn how to make a  spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"A spaceship, now,\" I said, unconsciously  adopting some of the  old manner.\n\n\n \"Leprechauns are not really mechanically  inclined,\" said Keech.  \"Their major passions are music  and laughter and mischief, as anyone  knows.\"\n\n\n \"Myself included,\" I agreed.  \"Then why do you need a spaceship?\"\n\n\n \"Well, if I may use an old expression,  we've had a feelin' lately  that we're not long for this world.  Or let me put it this way. We feel  the world isn't long for itself.\"\n\n\n I scratched my cheek. \"How  would a man unravel a statement  such as that?\"\n\n\n \"It's very simple. With all the  super weapons you mortals have  developed, there's the distinct possibility  you might be blowin' us all  up in the process of destroying  yourselves.\"\n\n\n \"There is that possibility,\" I said.\n\n\n \"Well, then, as I say,\" said  Keech, \"the little people have decided  to leave the planet in a spaceship.  Which we're buildin' here and  now. We've spied upon you and  learned how to do it. Well\u2014almost  how to do it. We haven't learned  yet how to control the power\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold on, now,\" I said. \"Leaving  the planet, you say. And where  would you be going?\"\n\n\n \"There's another committee  working on that. 'Tis not our concern.  I was inclined to suggest the  constellation Orion, which sounds  as though it has a good Irish name,  but I was hooted down. Be that as it  may, my own job was to go into  your nuclear center, learn how to  make the ship, and proceed with its  construction. Naturally, we didn't  understand all of your high-flyin'  science, but some of our people are  pretty clever at gettin' up replicas  of things.\"\n\n\n \"You mean you've been spying  on us at the center all this time? Do  you know, we often had the feeling  we were being watched, but we  thought it was by the Russians.  There's one thing which puzzles  me, though. If you've been constantly  around us\u2014and I'm still  able to see the little people\u2014why  did I never see you before?\"\n\n\n \"It may be we never crossed your  path. It may be you can only see us  when you're thinkin' of us, and of  course truly believin' in us. I don't  know\u2014'tis a thing of the mind, and  not important at the moment.  What's important is for us to get  our first ship to workin' properly  and then we'll be on our way.\"\n\n\n \"You're determined to go.\"\n\n\n \"Truly we are, Mr. Houlihan.  Now\u2014to business. Just during  these last few minutes a certain matter  has crossed my mind. That's  why I'm wastin' all this time with  you, sir. You say you are a scientist.\"\n\n\n \"A nuclear engineer.\"\n\n\n \"Well, then, it may be that you  can help us\u2014now that you know  we're here.\"\n\n\n \"Help you?\"\n\n\n \"The power control, Mr. Houlihan.  As I understand it, 'tis necessary  to know at any instant exactly  how much thrust is bein' delivered  through the little holes in back.  And on paper it looks simple  enough\u2014the square of somethin' or  other. I've got the figures jotted in  a book when I need 'em. But when  you get to doin' it it doesn't come  out exactly as it does on paper.\"\n\n\n \"You're referring to the necessity  for a coefficient of discharge.\"\n\n\n \"Whatever it might be named,\"  said Keech, shrugging. \"'Tis the  one thing we lack. I suppose eventually  you people will be gettin'  around to it. But meanwhile we  need it right now, if we're to make  our ship move.\"\n\n\n \"And you want me to help you  with this?\"\n\n\n \"That is exactly what crossed my  mind.\"\n\n\n I nodded and looked grave and  kneaded my chin for a moment softly.  \"Well, now, Keech,\" I said  finally, \"why should I help you?\"\n\n\n \"Ha!\" said Keech, grinning, but  not with humor, \"the avarice of  humans! I knew it! Well, Mr. Houlihan,  I'll give you reason enough.  The pot o' gold, Mr. Houlihan!\"\n\n\n \"The one at the end of the rainbow?\"\n\n\n \"It's not at the end of the rainbow.  That's a grandmother's tale.  Nor is it actually in an earthen  crock. But there's gold, all right,  enough to make you rich for the  rest of your life. And I'll make you  a proposition.\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"We'll not be needin' gold where  we're goin'. It's yours if you show  us how to make our ship work.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now, that's quite an  offer,\" I said. Keech had the goodness  to be quiet while I sat and  thought for a while. My pipe had  gone out and I lit it again. I finally  said, \"Let's have a look at your  ship's drive and see what we can  see.\"\n\n\n \"You accept the proposition  then?\"\n\n\n \"Let's have a look,\" I said, and  that was all.\n\n\n Well, we had a look, and then  several looks, and before the morning  was out we had half the spaceship  apart, and were deep in argument  about the whole project.\n\n\n It was a most fascinating session.  I had often wished for a true working  model at the center, but no allowance  had been inserted in the  budget for it. Keech brought me  paper and pencil and I talked with  the aid of diagrams, as engineers  are wont to do. Although the pencils  were small and I had to hold  them between thumb and forefinger,  as you would a needle, I was  able to make many sensible observations  and even a few innovations.\n\n\n I came back again the next day\u2014and  every day for the following  two weeks. It rained several times,  but Keech and his people made a  canopy of boughs and leaves and I  was comfortable enough. Every once  in a while someone from the town  or the center itself would pass by,  and stop to watch me. But of course  they wouldn't see the leprechauns  or anything the leprechauns had  made, not being believers.\n\n\n I would halt work, pass the time  of day, and then, in subtle fashion,  send the intruder on his way. Keech  and the little people just stood by  and grinned all the while.\n\n\n At the end of sixteen days I had  the entire problem all but whipped.  It is not difficult to understand why.  The working model and the fact  that the small people with their  quick eyes and clever fingers could  spot all sorts of minute shortcomings  was a great help. And I was  hearing the old tongue and talking  of the old things every day, and  truly that went far to take the clutter  out of my mind. I was no longer  so lonely that I couldn't think properly.\n\n\n On the sixteenth day I covered a  piece of paper with tiny mathematical  symbols and handed it to Keech.  \"Here is your equation,\" I said. \"It  will enable you to know your thrust  at any given moment, under any  circumstances, in or out of gravity,  and under all conditions of friction  and combustion.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you, Mr. Houlihan,\" said  Keech. All his people had gathered  in a loose circle, as though attending  a rite. They were all looking at  me quietly.\n\n\n \"Mr. Houlihan,\" said Keech,  \"you will not be forgotten by the  leprechauns. If we ever meet again,  upon another world perchance,  you'll find our friendship always  eager and ready.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" I said.\n\n\n \"And now, Mr. Houlihan,\" said  Keech, \"I'll see that a quantity of  gold is delivered to your rooms tonight,  and so keep my part of the  bargain.\"\n\n\n \"I'll not be needing the gold,\" I  said.\n\n\n Keech's eyebrows popped upward.  \"What's this now?\"\n\n\n \"I'll not be needing it,\" I repeated.  \"I don't feel it would be  right to take it for a service of this  sort.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Keech in surprise,  and in some awe, too, \"well, now,  musha Lord help us! 'Tis the first  time I ever heard such a speech  from a mortal.\" He turned to his  people. \"We'll have three cheers  now, do you hear, for Mr. Houlihan\u2014friend  of the little people as  long as he shall live!\"\n\n\n And they cheered. And little tears  crept into the corners of some of  their turned-up eyes.\n\n\n We shook hands, all of us, and I  left. I walked through the park, and  back to the nuclear propulsion center.  It was another cool, green morning  with the leaves making only  soft noises as the breezes came  along. It smelled exactly like a  wood I had known in Roscommon.\n\n\n And I lit my pipe and smoked it  slowly and chuckled to myself at  how I had gotten the best of the  little people. Surely it was not every  mortal who could accomplish that. I  had given them the wrong equation,  of course. They would never get  their spaceship to work now, and  later, if they tried to spy out the  right information I would take special  measures to prevent it, for I had  the advantage of being able to see  them.\n\n\n As for our own rocket ship, it  should be well on its way by next  St. Patrick's Day. For I had indeed  determined the true coefficient of  discharge, which I never could have  done so quickly without those sessions  in the glade with Keech and  his working model.\n\n\n It would go down in scientific  literature now, I suppose, as Houlihan's  Equation, and that was honor  and glory enough for me. I could  do without Keech's pot of gold,  though it would have been pleasant  to be truly rich for a change.\n\n\n There was no sense in cheating  him out of the gold to boot, for  leprechauns are most clever in matters  of this sort and he would have  had it back soon enough\u2014or else  made it a burden in some way.\n\n\n Indeed, I had done a piece of  work greatly to my advantage, and  also to the advantage of humankind,  and when a man can do the first and  include the second as a fortunate byproduct  it is a most happy accident.\n\n\n For if I had shown the little people  how to make a spaceship they  would have left our world. And  this world, as long as it lasts\u2014what  would it be in that event? I ask you  now, wouldn't we be even more likely to blow ourselves to Kingdom  Come without the little people here  for us to believe in every now and  then?

A one-time Air Force officer, he has turned to fantasy in  his lighter moments, to bring us such brightly sparkling little gems as this. houlihan's   equation by ... Walt Sheldon The tiny spaceship had been built for a journey to a star. But its  small, mischievous pilots had a rendezvous with destiny\u2014on Earth. I\u00a0must  admit that at first I  wasn't sure I was hearing those  noises. It was in a park near the  nuclear propulsion center\u2014a cool,  green spot, with the leaves all telling  each other to hush, be quiet,  and the soft breeze stirring them up  again. I had known precisely such  a secluded little green sanctuary just  over the hill from Mr. Riordan's  farm when I was a boy.\n\n\n Now it was a place I came to  when I had a problem to thrash out.  That morning I had been trying to  work out an equation to give the  coefficient of discharge for the matter  in combustion. You may call it  gas, if you wish, for we treated it  like gas at the center for convenience\u2014as  it came from the rocket  tubes in our engine.\n\n\n Without this coefficient to give  us control, we would have lacked a  workable equation when we set  about putting the first moon rocket  around those extraordinary engines  of ours, which were still in the undeveloped  blueprint stage.\n\n\n I see I shall have to explain this,  although I had hoped to get right  along with my story. When you  start from scratch, matter discharged  from any orifice has a velocity directly  proportional to the square  root of the pressure-head driving it.  But when you actually put things  together, contractions or expansions  in the gas, surface roughness  and other factors make the velocity  a bit smaller.\n\n\n At the terrible discharge speed  of nuclear explosion\u2014which is  what the drive amounts to despite  the fact that it is simply water in  which nuclear salts have been previously  dissolved\u2014this small factor  makes quite a difference. I had  to figure everything into it\u2014diameter  of the nozzle, sharpness of the  edge, the velocity of approach to the  point of discharge, atomic weight  and structure\u2014 Oh, there is so  much of this that if you're not a  nuclear engineer yourself it's certain  to weary you.\n\n\n Perhaps you had better take my  word for it that without this equation\u2014correctly  stated, mind you\u2014mankind  would be well advised not  to make a first trip to the moon.  And all this talk of coefficients and  equations sits strangely, you might  say, upon the tongue of a man  named Kevin Francis Houlihan.  But I am, after all, a scientist. If I  had not been a specialist in my field  I would hardly have found myself  engaged in vital research at the  center.\n\n\n Anyway, I heard these little  noises in the park. They sounded  like small working sounds, blending  in eerily mysterious fashion with a  chorus of small voices. I thought at  first it might be children at play,  but then at the time I was a bit  absent-minded. I tiptoed to the edge  of the trees, not wanting to deprive  any small scalawags of their pleasure,  and peered out between the  branches. And what do you suppose  I saw? Not children, but a  group of little people, hard at work.\n\n\n There was a leader, an older one  with a crank face. He was beating  the air with his arms and piping:  \"Over here, now! All right, bring  those electrical connections over  here\u2014and see you're not slow as  treacle about it!\"\n\n\n There were perhaps fifty of the  little people. I was more than startled  by it, too. I had not seen little  people in\u2014oh, close to thirty years.  I had seen them first as a boy of  eight, and then, very briefly again,  on my tenth birthday. And I had  become convinced they could never be seen here in America. I had  never seen them so busy, either.  They were building something in  the middle of the glade. It was long  and shiny and upright and a little  over five feet in height.\n\n\n \"Come along now, people!\" said  this crotchety one, looking straight  at me. \"Stop starin' and get to  work! You'll not be needin' to  mind that man standin' there! You  know he can't see nor hear us!\"\n\n\n Oh, it was good to hear the rich  old tongue again. I smiled, and the  foreman of the leprechauns\u2014if  that's what he was\u2014saw me smile  and became stiff and alert for a moment,  as though suspecting that perhaps  I actually could see him. Then  he shrugged and turned away, clearly  deeming such a thing impossible.\n\n\n I said, \"Just a minute, friend,  and I'll beg your pardon. It so happens  I can see you.\"\n\n\n He whirled to face me again,  staring open-mouthed. Then he  said, \"What? What's that, now?\"\n\n\n \"I can see you,\" I said.\n\n\n \"Ohhh!\" he said and put his  palms to his cheekbones. \"Saints be  with us! He's a believer! Run everybody\u2014run  for your lives!\"\n\n\n And they all began running, in  as many directions as there were  little souls. They began to scurry  behind the trees and bushes, and a  sloping embankment nearby.\n\n\n \"No, wait!\" I said. \"Don't go  away! I'll not be hurting you!\"\n\n\n They continued to scurry.\n\n\n I knew what it was they feared.  \"I don't intend catching one of  you!\" I said. \"Come back, you daft  little creatures!\"\n\n\n But the glade was silent, and they  had all disappeared. They thought I  wanted their crock of gold, of  course. I'd be entitled to it if I could  catch one and keep him. Or so the  legends affirmed, though I've wondered  often about the truth of them.  But I was after no gold. I only wanted  to hear the music of an Irish  tongue. I was lonely here in America,  even if I had latched on to a fine  job of work for almost shamefully  generous pay. You see, in a place as  full of science as the nuclear propulsion  center there is not much  time for the old things. I very much  wanted to talk to the little people.\n\n\n I walked over to the center of  the glade where the curious shiny  object was standing. It was as  smooth as glass and shaped like a  huge cigar. There were a pair of  triangular fins down at the bottom,  and stubby wings amidships. Of  course it was a spaceship, or a  miniature replica of one. I looked  at it more closely. Everything seemed  almost miraculously complete  and workable.\n\n\n I shook my head in wonder, then  stepped back from the spaceship  and looked about the glade. I knew  they were all hiding nearby, watching  me apprehensively. I lifted my  head to them.\n\n\n \"Listen to me now, little people!\"  I called out. \"My name's  Houlihan of the Roscommon Houlihans.  I am descended from King  Niall himself\u2014or so at least my  father used to say! Come on out  now, and pass the time o' day!\"\n\n\n Then I waited, but they didn't  answer. The little people always  had been shy. Yet without reaching  a decision in so many words I knew  suddenly that I had to talk to them.  I'd come to the glen to work out a  knotty problem, and I was up  against a blank wall. Simply because  I was so lonely that my mind had  become clogged.\n\n\n I knew that if I could just once  hear the old tongue again, and talk  about the old things, I might be able  to think the problem through to a  satisfactory conclusion.\n\n\n So I stepped back to the tiny  spaceship, and this time I struck it  a resounding blow with my fist.  \"Hear me now, little people! If you  don't show yourselves and come out  and talk to me, I'll wreck this spaceship  from stem to stern!\" I heard only the leaves rustling  softly.\n\n\n \"Do you understand? I'll give  you until I count three to make an  appearance! One!\"\n\n\n The glade remained deathly silent.\n\n\n \"Two!\"\n\n\n I thought I heard a stirring somewhere,  as if a small, brittle twig had  snapped in the underbrush.\n\n\n \" Three! \"\n\n\n And with that the little people  suddenly appeared.\n\n\n The leader\u2014he seemed more  wizened and bent than before\u2014approached  me slowly and warily as I  stood there. The others all followed  at a safe distance. I smiled to reassure  them and then waved my arm  in a friendly gesture of greeting.\n\n\n \"Good morning,\" I said.\n\n\n \"Good morning,\" the foreman  said with some caution. \"My name  is Keech.\"\n\n\n \"And mine's Houlihan, as I've  told you. Are you convinced now  that I have no intention of doing  you any injury?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Houlihan,\" said Keech,  drawing a kind of peppered dignity  up about himself, \"in such matters  I am never fully convinced. After  living for many centuries I am all  too acutely aware of the perversity  of human nature.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"Well, as you will  quickly see, all I want to do is  talk.\" I nodded as I spoke, and sat  down cross-legged upon the grass.\n\n\n \"Any Irishman wants to talk, Mr.  Houlihan.\"\n\n\n \"And often that's all he wants,\"  I said. \"Sit down with me now, and  stop staring as if I were a snake  returned to the Island.\"\n\n\n He shook his head and remained  standing. \"Have your say, Mr.  Houlihan. And afterward we'll appreciate  it if you'll go away and  leave us to our work.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now, your work,\" I said,  and glanced at the spaceship.  \"That's exactly what's got me curious.\"\n\n\n The others had edged in a bit  now and were standing in a circle,  intently staring at me. I took out my  pipe. \"Why,\" I asked, \"would a  group of little people be building a  spaceship here in America\u2014out in  this lonely place?\"\n\n\n Keech stared back without much  expression, and said, \"I've been  wondering how you guessed it was  a spaceship. I was surprised enough  when you told me you could see us  but not overwhelmingly so. I've run  into believers before who could see  the little people. It happens every  so often, though not as frequently  as it did a century ago. But knowing  a spaceship at first glance! Well, I  must confess that does astonish  me.\"\n\n\n \"And why wouldn't I know a  spaceship when I see one?\" I said.  \"It just so happens I'm a doctor of  science.\"\n\n\n \"A doctor of science, now,\" said  Keech.\n\n\n \"Invited by the American government  to work on the first moon  rocket here at the nuclear propulsion  center. Since it's no secret I  can advise you of it.\"\n\n\n \"A scientist, is it,\" said Keech.  \"Well, now, that's very interesting.\"\n\n\n \"I'll make no apologies for it,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Oh, there's no need for apology,\"  said Keech. \"Though in truth  we prefer poets to scientists. But it  has just now crossed my mind, Mr.  Houlihan that you, being a scientist,  might be of help to us.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" I asked.\n\n\n \"Well, I might try starting at the  beginning,\" he replied.\n\n\n \"You might,\" I said. \"A man  usually does.\"\n\n\n Keech took out his own pipe\u2014a  clay dudeen\u2014and looked hopeful.  I gave him a pinch of tobacco from  my pouch. \"Well, now,\" he said,  \"first of all you're no doubt surprised  to find us here in America.\"\n\n\n \"I am surprised from time to  time to find myself here,\" I said.  \"But continue.\"\n\n\n \"We had to come here,\" said  Keech, \"to learn how to make a  spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"A spaceship, now,\" I said, unconsciously  adopting some of the  old manner.\n\n\n \"Leprechauns are not really mechanically  inclined,\" said Keech.  \"Their major passions are music  and laughter and mischief, as anyone  knows.\"\n\n\n \"Myself included,\" I agreed.  \"Then why do you need a spaceship?\"\n\n\n \"Well, if I may use an old expression,  we've had a feelin' lately  that we're not long for this world.  Or let me put it this way. We feel  the world isn't long for itself.\"\n\n\n I scratched my cheek. \"How  would a man unravel a statement  such as that?\"\n\n\n \"It's very simple. With all the  super weapons you mortals have  developed, there's the distinct possibility  you might be blowin' us all  up in the process of destroying  yourselves.\"\n\n\n \"There is that possibility,\" I said.\n\n\n \"Well, then, as I say,\" said  Keech, \"the little people have decided  to leave the planet in a spaceship.  Which we're buildin' here and  now. We've spied upon you and  learned how to do it. Well\u2014almost  how to do it. We haven't learned  yet how to control the power\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold on, now,\" I said. \"Leaving  the planet, you say. And where  would you be going?\"\n\n\n \"There's another committee  working on that. 'Tis not our concern.  I was inclined to suggest the  constellation Orion, which sounds  as though it has a good Irish name,  but I was hooted down. Be that as it  may, my own job was to go into  your nuclear center, learn how to  make the ship, and proceed with its  construction. Naturally, we didn't  understand all of your high-flyin'  science, but some of our people are  pretty clever at gettin' up replicas  of things.\"\n\n\n \"You mean you've been spying  on us at the center all this time? Do  you know, we often had the feeling  we were being watched, but we  thought it was by the Russians.  There's one thing which puzzles  me, though. If you've been constantly  around us\u2014and I'm still  able to see the little people\u2014why  did I never see you before?\"\n\n\n \"It may be we never crossed your  path. It may be you can only see us  when you're thinkin' of us, and of  course truly believin' in us. I don't  know\u2014'tis a thing of the mind, and  not important at the moment.  What's important is for us to get  our first ship to workin' properly  and then we'll be on our way.\"\n\n\n \"You're determined to go.\"\n\n\n \"Truly we are, Mr. Houlihan.  Now\u2014to business. Just during  these last few minutes a certain matter  has crossed my mind. That's  why I'm wastin' all this time with  you, sir. You say you are a scientist.\"\n\n\n \"A nuclear engineer.\"\n\n\n \"Well, then, it may be that you  can help us\u2014now that you know  we're here.\"\n\n\n \"Help you?\"\n\n\n \"The power control, Mr. Houlihan.  As I understand it, 'tis necessary  to know at any instant exactly  how much thrust is bein' delivered  through the little holes in back.  And on paper it looks simple  enough\u2014the square of somethin' or  other. I've got the figures jotted in  a book when I need 'em. But when  you get to doin' it it doesn't come  out exactly as it does on paper.\"\n\n\n \"You're referring to the necessity  for a coefficient of discharge.\"\n\n\n \"Whatever it might be named,\"  said Keech, shrugging. \"'Tis the  one thing we lack. I suppose eventually  you people will be gettin'  around to it. But meanwhile we  need it right now, if we're to make  our ship move.\"\n\n\n \"And you want me to help you  with this?\"\n\n\n \"That is exactly what crossed my  mind.\"\n\n\n I nodded and looked grave and  kneaded my chin for a moment softly.  \"Well, now, Keech,\" I said  finally, \"why should I help you?\"\n\n\n \"Ha!\" said Keech, grinning, but  not with humor, \"the avarice of  humans! I knew it! Well, Mr. Houlihan,  I'll give you reason enough.  The pot o' gold, Mr. Houlihan!\"\n\n\n \"The one at the end of the rainbow?\"\n\n\n \"It's not at the end of the rainbow.  That's a grandmother's tale.  Nor is it actually in an earthen  crock. But there's gold, all right,  enough to make you rich for the  rest of your life. And I'll make you  a proposition.\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"We'll not be needin' gold where  we're goin'. It's yours if you show  us how to make our ship work.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now, that's quite an  offer,\" I said. Keech had the goodness  to be quiet while I sat and  thought for a while. My pipe had  gone out and I lit it again. I finally  said, \"Let's have a look at your  ship's drive and see what we can  see.\"\n\n\n \"You accept the proposition  then?\"\n\n\n \"Let's have a look,\" I said, and  that was all.\n\n\n Well, we had a look, and then  several looks, and before the morning  was out we had half the spaceship  apart, and were deep in argument  about the whole project.\n\n\n It was a most fascinating session.  I had often wished for a true working  model at the center, but no allowance  had been inserted in the  budget for it. Keech brought me  paper and pencil and I talked with  the aid of diagrams, as engineers  are wont to do. Although the pencils  were small and I had to hold  them between thumb and forefinger,  as you would a needle, I was  able to make many sensible observations  and even a few innovations.\n\n\n I came back again the next day\u2014and  every day for the following  two weeks. It rained several times,  but Keech and his people made a  canopy of boughs and leaves and I  was comfortable enough. Every once  in a while someone from the town  or the center itself would pass by,  and stop to watch me. But of course  they wouldn't see the leprechauns  or anything the leprechauns had  made, not being believers.\n\n\n I would halt work, pass the time  of day, and then, in subtle fashion,  send the intruder on his way. Keech  and the little people just stood by  and grinned all the while.\n\n\n At the end of sixteen days I had  the entire problem all but whipped.  It is not difficult to understand why.  The working model and the fact  that the small people with their  quick eyes and clever fingers could  spot all sorts of minute shortcomings  was a great help. And I was  hearing the old tongue and talking  of the old things every day, and  truly that went far to take the clutter  out of my mind. I was no longer  so lonely that I couldn't think properly.\n\n\n On the sixteenth day I covered a  piece of paper with tiny mathematical  symbols and handed it to Keech.  \"Here is your equation,\" I said. \"It  will enable you to know your thrust  at any given moment, under any  circumstances, in or out of gravity,  and under all conditions of friction  and combustion.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you, Mr. Houlihan,\" said  Keech. All his people had gathered  in a loose circle, as though attending  a rite. They were all looking at  me quietly.\n\n\n \"Mr. Houlihan,\" said Keech,  \"you will not be forgotten by the  leprechauns. If we ever meet again,  upon another world perchance,  you'll find our friendship always  eager and ready.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" I said.\n\n\n \"And now, Mr. Houlihan,\" said  Keech, \"I'll see that a quantity of  gold is delivered to your rooms tonight,  and so keep my part of the  bargain.\"\n\n\n \"I'll not be needing the gold,\" I  said.\n\n\n Keech's eyebrows popped upward.  \"What's this now?\"\n\n\n \"I'll not be needing it,\" I repeated.  \"I don't feel it would be  right to take it for a service of this  sort.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Keech in surprise,  and in some awe, too, \"well, now,  musha Lord help us! 'Tis the first  time I ever heard such a speech  from a mortal.\" He turned to his  people. \"We'll have three cheers  now, do you hear, for Mr. Houlihan\u2014friend  of the little people as  long as he shall live!\"\n\n\n And they cheered. And little tears  crept into the corners of some of  their turned-up eyes.\n\n\n We shook hands, all of us, and I  left. I walked through the park, and  back to the nuclear propulsion center.  It was another cool, green morning  with the leaves making only  soft noises as the breezes came  along. It smelled exactly like a  wood I had known in Roscommon.\n\n\n And I lit my pipe and smoked it  slowly and chuckled to myself at  how I had gotten the best of the  little people. Surely it was not every  mortal who could accomplish that. I  had given them the wrong equation,  of course. They would never get  their spaceship to work now, and  later, if they tried to spy out the  right information I would take special  measures to prevent it, for I had  the advantage of being able to see  them.\n\n\n As for our own rocket ship, it  should be well on its way by next  St. Patrick's Day. For I had indeed  determined the true coefficient of  discharge, which I never could have  done so quickly without those sessions  in the glade with Keech and  his working model.\n\n\n It would go down in scientific  literature now, I suppose, as Houlihan's  Equation, and that was honor  and glory enough for me. I could  do without Keech's pot of gold,  though it would have been pleasant  to be truly rich for a change.\n\n\n There was no sense in cheating  him out of the gold to boot, for  leprechauns are most clever in matters  of this sort and he would have  had it back soon enough\u2014or else  made it a burden in some way.\n\n\n Indeed, I had done a piece of  work greatly to my advantage, and  also to the advantage of humankind,  and when a man can do the first and  include the second as a fortunate byproduct  it is a most happy accident.\n\n\n For if I had shown the little people  how to make a spaceship they  would have left our world. And  this world, as long as it lasts\u2014what  would it be in that event? I ask you  now, wouldn't we be even more likely to blow ourselves to Kingdom  Come without the little people here  for us to believe in every now and  then?

If I  had not been a specialist in my field  I would hardly have found myself  engaged in vital research at the  center.\n\n\n Anyway, I heard these little  noises in the park. They sounded  like small working sounds, blending  in eerily mysterious fashion with a  chorus of small voices. I thought at  first it might be children at play,  but then at the time I was a bit  absent-minded. I tiptoed to the edge  of the trees, not wanting to deprive  any small scalawags of their pleasure,  and peered out between the  branches. And what do you suppose  I saw? Not children, but a  group of little people, hard at work.\n\n\n There was a leader, an older one  with a crank face. He was beating  the air with his arms and piping:  \"Over here, now! All right, bring  those electrical connections over  here\u2014and see you're not slow as  treacle about it!\"\n\n\n There were perhaps fifty of the  little people. I was more than startled  by it, too. I had not seen little  people in\u2014oh, close to thirty years.  I had seen them first as a boy of  eight, and then, very briefly again,  on my tenth birthday. And I had  become convinced they could never be seen here in America. I had  never seen them so busy, either.  They were building something in  the middle of the glade. It was long  and shiny and upright and a little  over five feet in height.\n\n\n \"Come along now, people!\" said  this crotchety one, looking straight  at me. \"Stop starin' and get to  work! You'll not be needin' to  mind that man standin' there! You  know he can't see nor hear us!\"\n\n\n Oh, it was good to hear the rich  old tongue again. I smiled, and the  foreman of the leprechauns\u2014if  that's what he was\u2014saw me smile  and became stiff and alert for a moment,  as though suspecting that perhaps  I actually could see him. Then  he shrugged and turned away, clearly  deeming such a thing impossible.\n\n\n I said, \"Just a minute, friend,  and I'll beg your pardon. It so happens  I can see you.\"\n\n\n He whirled to face me again,  staring open-mouthed. Then he  said, \"What? What's that, now?\"\n\n\n \"I can see you,\" I said.\n\n\n \"Ohhh!\" he said and put his  palms to his cheekbones. \"Saints be  with us! He's a believer! Run everybody\u2014run  for your lives!\"\n\n\n And they all began running, in  as many directions as there were  little souls. They began to scurry  behind the trees and bushes, and a  sloping embankment nearby.\n\n\n \"No, wait!\" I said. \"Don't go  away! I'll not be hurting you!\"\n\n\n They continued to scurry.\n\n\n I knew what it was they feared.  \"I don't intend catching one of  you!\" I said. \"Come back, you daft  little creatures!\"\n\n\n But the glade was silent, and they  had all disappeared. They thought I  wanted their crock of gold, of  course. I'd be entitled to it if I could  catch one and keep him. Or so the  legends affirmed, though I've wondered  often about the truth of them.  But I was after no gold. I only wanted  to hear the music of an Irish  tongue. I was lonely here in America,  even if I had latched on to a fine  job of work for almost shamefully  generous pay. You see, in a place as  full of science as the nuclear propulsion  center there is not much  time for the old things. I very much  wanted to talk to the little people.\n\n\n I walked over to the center of  the glade where the curious shiny  object was standing. It was as  smooth as glass and shaped like a  huge cigar. There were a pair of  triangular fins down at the bottom,  and stubby wings amidships. Of  course it was a spaceship, or a  miniature replica of one. I looked  at it more closely. Everything seemed  almost miraculously complete  and workable.\n\n\n I shook my head in wonder, then  stepped back from the spaceship  and looked about the glade. I knew  they were all hiding nearby, watching  me apprehensively. I lifted my  head to them.\n\n\n \"Listen to me now, little people!\"  I called out. \"My name's  Houlihan of the Roscommon Houlihans.  I am descended from King  Niall himself\u2014or so at least my  father used to say! Come on out  now, and pass the time o' day!\"\n\n\n Then I waited, but they didn't  answer. The little people always  had been shy. Yet without reaching  a decision in so many words I knew  suddenly that I had to talk to them.  I'd come to the glen to work out a  knotty problem, and I was up  against a blank wall. Simply because  I was so lonely that my mind had  become clogged.\n\n\n I knew that if I could just once  hear the old tongue again, and talk  about the old things, I might be able  to think the problem through to a  satisfactory conclusion.\n\n\n So I stepped back to the tiny  spaceship, and this time I struck it  a resounding blow with my fist.  \"Hear me now, little people! If you  don't show yourselves and come out  and talk to me, I'll wreck this spaceship  from stem to stern!\" I heard only the leaves rustling  softly.\n\n\n \"Do you understand? I'll give  you until I count three to make an  appearance! One!\"\n\n\n The glade remained deathly silent.\n\n\n \"Two!\"\n\n\n I thought I heard a stirring somewhere,  as if a small, brittle twig had  snapped in the underbrush.\n\n\n \" Three! \"\n\n\n And with that the little people  suddenly appeared.\n\n\n The leader\u2014he seemed more  wizened and bent than before\u2014approached  me slowly and warily as I  stood there. The others all followed  at a safe distance. I smiled to reassure  them and then waved my arm  in a friendly gesture of greeting.\n\n\n \"Good morning,\" I said.\n\n\n \"Good morning,\" the foreman  said with some caution. \"My name  is Keech.\"\n\n\n \"And mine's Houlihan, as I've  told you. Are you convinced now  that I have no intention of doing  you any injury?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Houlihan,\" said Keech,  drawing a kind of peppered dignity  up about himself, \"in such matters  I am never fully convinced. After  living for many centuries I am all  too acutely aware of the perversity  of human nature.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"Well, as you will  quickly see, all I want to do is  talk.\" I nodded as I spoke, and sat  down cross-legged upon the grass.\n\n\n \"Any Irishman wants to talk, Mr.  Houlihan.\"\n\n\n \"And often that's all he wants,\"  I said. \"Sit down with me now, and  stop staring as if I were a snake  returned to the Island.\"\n\n\n He shook his head and remained  standing. \"Have your say, Mr.  Houlihan. And afterward we'll appreciate  it if you'll go away and  leave us to our work.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now, your work,\" I said,  and glanced at the spaceship.  \"That's exactly what's got me curious.\"\n\n\n The others had edged in a bit  now and were standing in a circle,  intently staring at me. I took out my  pipe. \"Why,\" I asked, \"would a  group of little people be building a  spaceship here in America\u2014out in  this lonely place?\"\n\n\n Keech stared back without much  expression, and said, \"I've been  wondering how you guessed it was  a spaceship. I was surprised enough  when you told me you could see us  but not overwhelmingly so. I've run  into believers before who could see  the little people. It happens every  so often, though not as frequently  as it did a century ago. But knowing  a spaceship at first glance! Well, I  must confess that does astonish  me.\"\n\n\n \"And why wouldn't I know a  spaceship when I see one?\" I said.  \"It just so happens I'm a doctor of  science.\"\n\n\n \"A doctor of science, now,\" said  Keech.\n\n\n \"Invited by the American government  to work on the first moon  rocket here at the nuclear propulsion  center. Since it's no secret I  can advise you of it.\"\n\n\n \"A scientist, is it,\" said Keech.  \"Well, now, that's very interesting.\"\n\n\n \"I'll make no apologies for it,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Oh, there's no need for apology,\"  said Keech. \"Though in truth  we prefer poets to scientists. But it  has just now crossed my mind, Mr.  Houlihan that you, being a scientist,  might be of help to us.\"\n\n\n \"How?\" I asked.\n\n\n \"Well, I might try starting at the  beginning,\" he replied.\n\n\n \"You might,\" I said. \"A man  usually does.\"\n\n\n Keech took out his own pipe\u2014a  clay dudeen\u2014and looked hopeful.  I gave him a pinch of tobacco from  my pouch. \"Well, now,\" he said,  \"first of all you're no doubt surprised  to find us here in America.\"\n\n\n \"I am surprised from time to  time to find myself here,\" I said.  \"But continue.\"\n\n\n \"We had to come here,\" said  Keech, \"to learn how to make a  spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"A spaceship, now,\" I said, unconsciously  adopting some of the  old manner.\n\n\n \"Leprechauns are not really mechanically  inclined,\" said Keech.  \"Their major passions are music  and laughter and mischief, as anyone  knows.\"\n\n\n \"Myself included,\" I agreed.  \"Then why do you need a spaceship?\"\n\n\n \"Well, if I may use an old expression,  we've had a feelin' lately  that we're not long for this world.  Or let me put it this way. We feel  the world isn't long for itself.\"\n\n\n I scratched my cheek. \"How  would a man unravel a statement  such as that?\"\n\n\n \"It's very simple. With all the  super weapons you mortals have  developed, there's the distinct possibility  you might be blowin' us all  up in the process of destroying  yourselves.\"\n\n\n \"There is that possibility,\" I said.\n\n\n \"Well, then, as I say,\" said  Keech, \"the little people have decided  to leave the planet in a spaceship.  Which we're buildin' here and  now. We've spied upon you and  learned how to do it. Well\u2014almost  how to do it. We haven't learned  yet how to control the power\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold on, now,\" I said. \"Leaving  the planet, you say. And where  would you be going?\"\n\n\n \"There's another committee  working on that. 'Tis not our concern.  I was inclined to suggest the  constellation Orion, which sounds  as though it has a good Irish name,  but I was hooted down. Be that as it  may, my own job was to go into  your nuclear center, learn how to  make the ship, and proceed with its  construction. Naturally, we didn't  understand all of your high-flyin'  science, but some of our people are  pretty clever at gettin' up replicas  of things.\"\n\n\n \"You mean you've been spying  on us at the center all this time? Do  you know, we often had the feeling  we were being watched, but we  thought it was by the Russians.  There's one thing which puzzles  me, though. If you've been constantly  around us\u2014and I'm still  able to see the little people\u2014why  did I never see you before?\"\n\n\n \"It may be we never crossed your  path. It may be you can only see us  when you're thinkin' of us, and of  course truly believin' in us. I don't  know\u2014'tis a thing of the mind, and  not important at the moment.  What's important is for us to get  our first ship to workin' properly  and then we'll be on our way.\"\n\n\n \"You're determined to go.\"\n\n\n \"Truly we are, Mr. Houlihan.  Now\u2014to business. Just during  these last few minutes a certain matter  has crossed my mind. That's  why I'm wastin' all this time with  you, sir. You say you are a scientist.\"\n\n\n \"A nuclear engineer.\"\n\n\n \"Well, then, it may be that you  can help us\u2014now that you know  we're here.\"\n\n\n \"Help you?\"\n\n\n \"The power control, Mr. Houlihan.  As I understand it, 'tis necessary  to know at any instant exactly  how much thrust is bein' delivered  through the little holes in back.  And on paper it looks simple  enough\u2014the square of somethin' or  other. I've got the figures jotted in  a book when I need 'em. But when  you get to doin' it it doesn't come  out exactly as it does on paper.\"\n\n\n \"You're referring to the necessity  for a coefficient of discharge.\"\n\n\n \"Whatever it might be named,\"  said Keech, shrugging. \"'Tis the  one thing we lack. I suppose eventually  you people will be gettin'  around to it. But meanwhile we  need it right now, if we're to make  our ship move.\"\n\n\n \"And you want me to help you  with this?\"\n\n\n \"That is exactly what crossed my  mind.\"\n\n\n I nodded and looked grave and  kneaded my chin for a moment softly.  \"Well, now, Keech,\" I said  finally, \"why should I help you?\"\n\n\n \"Ha!\" said Keech, grinning, but  not with humor, \"the avarice of  humans! I knew it! Well, Mr. Houlihan,  I'll give you reason enough.  The pot o' gold, Mr. Houlihan!\"\n\n\n \"The one at the end of the rainbow?\"\n\n\n \"It's not at the end of the rainbow.  That's a grandmother's tale.  Nor is it actually in an earthen  crock. But there's gold, all right,  enough to make you rich for the  rest of your life. And I'll make you  a proposition.\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"We'll not be needin' gold where  we're goin'. It's yours if you show  us how to make our ship work.\"\n\n\n \"Well, now, that's quite an  offer,\" I said. Keech had the goodness  to be quiet while I sat and  thought for a while. My pipe had  gone out and I lit it again. I finally  said, \"Let's have a look at your  ship's drive and see what we can  see.\"\n\n\n \"You accept the proposition  then?\"\n\n\n \"Let's have a look,\" I said, and  that was all.\n\n\n Well, we had a look, and then  several looks, and before the morning  was out we had half the spaceship  apart, and were deep in argument  about the whole project.\n\n\n It was a most fascinating session.  I had often wished for a true working  model at the center, but no allowance  had been inserted in the  budget for it. Keech brought me  paper and pencil and I talked with  the aid of diagrams, as engineers  are wont to do. Although the pencils  were small and I had to hold  them between thumb and forefinger,  as you would a needle, I was  able to make many sensible observations  and even a few innovations.\n\n\n I came back again the next day\u2014and  every day for the following  two weeks. It rained several times,  but Keech and his people made a  canopy of boughs and leaves and I  was comfortable enough. Every once  in a while someone from the town  or the center itself would pass by,  and stop to watch me. But of course  they wouldn't see the leprechauns  or anything the leprechauns had  made, not being believers.\n\n\n I would halt work, pass the time  of day, and then, in subtle fashion,  send the intruder on his way. Keech  and the little people just stood by  and grinned all the while.\n\n\n At the end of sixteen days I had  the entire problem all but whipped.  It is not difficult to understand why.  The working model and the fact  that the small people with their  quick eyes and clever fingers could  spot all sorts of minute shortcomings  was a great help. And I was  hearing the old tongue and talking  of the old things every day, and  truly that went far to take the clutter  out of my mind. I was no longer  so lonely that I couldn't think properly.\n\n\n On the sixteenth day I covered a  piece of paper with tiny mathematical  symbols and handed it to Keech.  \"Here is your equation,\" I said. \"It  will enable you to know your thrust  at any given moment, under any  circumstances, in or out of gravity,  and under all conditions of friction  and combustion.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you, Mr. Houlihan,\" said  Keech. All his people had gathered  in a loose circle, as though attending  a rite. They were all looking at  me quietly.\n\n\n \"Mr. Houlihan,\" said Keech,  \"you will not be forgotten by the  leprechauns. If we ever meet again,  upon another world perchance,  you'll find our friendship always  eager and ready.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" I said.\n\n\n \"And now, Mr. Houlihan,\" said  Keech, \"I'll see that a quantity of  gold is delivered to your rooms tonight,  and so keep my part of the  bargain.\"\n\n\n \"I'll not be needing the gold,\" I  said.\n\n\n Keech's eyebrows popped upward.  \"What's this now?\"\n\n\n \"I'll not be needing it,\" I repeated.  \"I don't feel it would be  right to take it for a service of this  sort.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Keech in surprise,  and in some awe, too, \"well, now,  musha Lord help us! 'Tis the first  time I ever heard such a speech  from a mortal.\" He turned to his  people. \"We'll have three cheers  now, do you hear, for Mr. Houlihan\u2014friend  of the little people as  long as he shall live!\"\n\n\n And they cheered. And little tears  crept into the corners of some of  their turned-up eyes.\n\n\n We shook hands, all of us, and I  left. I walked through the park, and  back to the nuclear propulsion center.  It was another cool, green morning  with the leaves making only  soft noises as the breezes came  along. It smelled exactly like a  wood I had known in Roscommon.\n\n\n And I lit my pipe and smoked it  slowly and chuckled to myself at  how I had gotten the best of the  little people. Surely it was not every  mortal who could accomplish that. I  had given them the wrong equation,  of course. They would never get  their spaceship to work now, and  later, if they tried to spy out the  right information I would take special  measures to prevent it, for I had  the advantage of being able to see  them.\n\n\n As for our own rocket ship, it  should be well on its way by next  St. Patrick's Day. For I had indeed  determined the true coefficient of  discharge, which I never could have  done so quickly without those sessions  in the glade with Keech and  his working model.\n\n\n It would go down in scientific  literature now, I suppose, as Houlihan's  Equation, and that was honor  and glory enough for me. I could  do without Keech's pot of gold,  though it would have been pleasant  to be truly rich for a change.\n\n\n There was no sense in cheating  him out of the gold to boot, for  leprechauns are most clever in matters  of this sort and he would have  had it back soon enough\u2014or else  made it a burden in some way.\n\n\n Indeed, I had done a piece of  work greatly to my advantage, and  also to the advantage of humankind,  and when a man can do the first and  include the second as a fortunate byproduct  it is a most happy accident.\n\n\n For if I had shown the little people  how to make a spaceship they  would have left our world. And  this world, as long as it lasts\u2014what  would it be in that event? I ask you  now, wouldn't we be even more likely to blow ourselves to Kingdom  Come without the little people here  for us to believe in every now and  then?
