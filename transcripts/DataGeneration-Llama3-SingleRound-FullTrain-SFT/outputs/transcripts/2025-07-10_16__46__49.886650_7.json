      "background_text": "BEACH SCENE By MARSHALL KING\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1960.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] It was a fine day at the beach   for Purnie's game\u2014but his new   friends played very rough! Purnie ran laughing and shouting through the forest until he could run  no more. He fell headlong into a patch of blue moss and whooped with  delight in having this day free for exploring. He was free to see the  ocean at last.\n\n\n When he had caught his breath, he looked back through the forest. No  sign of the village; he had left it far behind. Safe from the scrutiny  of brothers and parents, there was nothing now to stop him from going  to the ocean. This was the moment to stop time.\n\n\n \"On your mark!\" he shouted to the rippling stream and its orange  whirlpools. He glanced furtively from side to side, pretending that  some object might try to get a head start. \"Get set!\" he challenged  the thin-winged bees that hovered over the abundant foliage. \"Stop!\"  He shrieked this command upward toward the dense, low-hanging purple  clouds that perennially raced across the treetops, making one wonder  how tall the trees really were.\n\n\n His eyes took quick inventory. It was exactly as he knew it would be:  the milky-orange stream had become motionless and its minute whirlpools  had stopped whirling; a nearby bee hung suspended over a paka plant,  its transparent wings frozen in position for a downward stroke; and the  heavy purple fluid overhead held fast in its manufacture of whorls and  nimbi.\n\n\n With everything around him in a state of perfect tableau, Purnie  hurried toward the ocean.\n\n\n If only the days weren't so short! he thought. There was so much to  see and so little time. It seemed that everyone except him had seen  the wonders of the beach country. The stories he had heard from his  brothers and their friends had taunted him for as long as he could  remember. So many times had he heard these thrilling tales that now,  as he ran along, he could clearly picture the wonderland as though he  were already there. There would be a rockslide of petrified logs to  play on, the ocean itself with waves higher than a house, the comical  three-legged tripons who never stopped munching on seaweed, and many  kinds of other wonderful creatures found only at the ocean.\n\n\n He bounced through the forest as though the world was reserved this  day just for him. And who could say it wasn't? he thought. Wasn't this  his fifth birthday? He ran along feeling sorry for four-year-olds, and  even for those who were only four and a half, for they were babies and  wouldn't dare try slipping away to the ocean alone. But five!\n\n\n \"I'll set you free, Mr. Bee\u2014just wait and see!\" As he passed one of  the many motionless pollen-gathering insects he met on the way, he took  care not to brush against it or disturb its interrupted task. When  Purnie had stopped time, the bees\u2014like all the other creatures he  met\u2014had been arrested in their native activities, and he knew that as  soon as he resumed time, everything would pick up where it had left off. When he smelled an acid sweetness that told him the ocean was not far  off, his pulse quickened in anticipation. Rather than spoil what was  clearly going to be a perfect day, he chose to ignore the fact that he  had been forbidden to use time-stopping as a convenience for journeying  far from home. He chose to ignore the oft-repeated statement that an  hour of time-stopping consumed more energy than a week of foot-racing.  He chose to ignore the negative maxim that \"small children who stop  time without an adult being present, may not live to regret it.\"\n\n\n He chose, instead, to picture the beaming praise of family and friends  when they learned of his brave journey.\n\n\n The journey was long, the clock stood still. He stopped long enough to  gather some fruit that grew along the path. It would serve as his lunch  during this day of promise. With it under his arm he bounded along a  dozen more steps, then stopped abruptly in his tracks.\n\n\n He found himself atop a rocky knoll, overlooking the mighty sea!\n\n\n He was so overpowered by the vista before him that his \"Hurrah!\" came  out as a weak squeak. The ocean lay at the ready, its stilled waves  awaiting his command to resume their tidal sweep. The breakers along  the shoreline hung in varying stages of disarray, some having already  exploded into towering white spray while others were poised in smooth  orange curls waiting to start that action.\n\n\n And there were new friends everywhere! Overhead, a flock of spora were  frozen in a steep glide, preparatory to a beach landing. Purnie had  heard of these playful creatures many times. Today, with his brothers  in school, he would have the pets all to himself. Further down the  beach was a pair of two-legged animals poised in mid-step, facing  the spot where Purnie now stood. Some distance behind them were eight  more, each of whom were motionless in a curious pose of interrupted  animation. And down in the water, where the ocean ran itself into thin  nothingness upon the sand, he saw standing here and there the comical  tripons, those three-legged marine buffoons who made handsome careers  of munching seaweed.\n\n\n \"Hi there!\" Purnie called. When he got no reaction, he remembered that  he himself was \"dead\" to the living world: he was still in a zone of  time-stopping, on the inside looking out. For him, the world would  continue to be a tableau of mannikins until he resumed time. \"Hi there!\" he called again; but now his mental attitude was that he  expected time to resume. It did! Immediately he was surrounded by  activity. He heard the roar of the crashing orange breakers, he tasted  the dew of acid that floated from the spray, and he saw his new friends  continue the actions which he had stopped while back in the forest.\n\n\n He knew, too, that at this moment, in the forest, the little brook  picked up its flow where it had left off, the purple clouds resumed  their leeward journey up the valley, and the bees continued their  pollen-gathering without having missed a single stroke of their  delicate wings. The brook, the clouds, and the insects had not been  interrupted in the least; their respective tasks had been performed  with continuing sureness. It was time itself that Purnie had stopped,  not the world around him.\n\n\n He scampered around the rockpile and down the sandy cliff to meet the  tripons who, to him, had just come to life.\n\n\n \"I can stand on my head!\" He set down his lunch and balanced himself  bottoms-up while his legs pawed the air in an effort to hold him in  position. He knew it was probably the worst head-stand he had ever  done, for he felt weak and dizzy. Already time-stopping had left its  mark on his strength. But his spirits ran on unchecked.\n\n\n The tripon thought Purnie's feat was superb. It stopped munching long  enough to give him a salutory wag of its rump before returning to its  repast.\n\n\n Purnie ran from pillar to post, trying to see and do everything at  once. He looked around to greet the flock of spora, but they had glided  to a spot further along the shore. Then, bouncing up to the first of  the two-legged animals, he started to burst forth with his habitual \"Hi  there!\" when he heard them making sounds of their own.\n\n\n \"... will be no limit to my operations now, Benson. This planet makes  seventeen. Seventeen planets I can claim as my own!\"\n\n\n \"My, my. Seventeen planets. And tell me, Forbes, just what the hell are  you going to do with them\u2014mount them on the wall of your den back in  San Diego?\"\n\n\n \"Hi there, wanna play?\" Purnie's invitation got nothing more than  startled glance from the animals who quickly returned to their chatter.  He scampered up the beach, picked up his lunch, and ran back to them,  tagging along at their heels. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n\n\n \"Benson, you'd better tell your men back there to stop gawking at  the scenery and get to work. Time is money. I didn't pay for this  expedition just to give your flunkies a vacation.\" The animals stopped so suddenly that Purnie nearly tangled himself in  their heels.\n\n\n \"All right, Forbes, just hold it a minute. Listen to me. Sure, it's  your money that put us here; it's your expedition all the way. But you  hired me to get you here with the best crew on earth, and that's just  what I've done. My job isn't over yet. I'm responsible for the safety  of the men while we're here, and for the safe trip home.\"\n\n\n \"Precisely. And since you're responsible, get 'em working. Tell 'em to  bring along the flag. Look at the damn fools back there, playing in the  ocean with a three-legged ostrich!\"\n\n\n \"Good God, man, aren't you human? We've only been on this planet twenty  minutes! Naturally they want to look around. They half expected to find  wild animals or worse, and here we are surrounded by quaint little  creatures that run up to us like we're long-lost brothers. Let the men  look around a minute or two before we stake out your claim.\"\n\n\n \"Bah! Bunch of damn children.\"\n\n\n As Purnie followed along, a leg shot out at him and missed. \"Benson,  will you get this bug-eyed kangaroo away from me!\" Purnie shrieked with  joy at this new frolic and promptly stood on his head. In this position  he got an upside down view of them walking away.\n\n\n He gave up trying to stay with them. Why did they move so fast, anyway?  What was the hurry? As he sat down and began eating his lunch, three  more of the creatures came along making excited noises, apparently  trying to catch up to the first two. As they passed him, he held out  his lunch. \"Want some?\" No response.\n\n\n Playing held more promise than eating. He left his lunch half eaten and  went down to where they had stopped further along the beach.\n\n\n \"Captain Benson, sir! Miles has detected strong radiation in the  vicinity. He's trying to locate it now.\"\n\n\n \"There you are, Forbes. Your new piece of real estate is going to make  you so rich that you can buy your next planet. That'll make eighteen, I  believe.\"\n\n\n \"Radiation, bah! We've found low-grade ore on every planet I've  discovered so far, and this one'll be no different. Now how about that  flag? Let's get it up, Benson. And the cornerstone, and the plaque.\"\n\n\n \"All right, lads. The sooner we get Mr. Forbes's pennant raised and his  claim staked out, the sooner we can take time to look around. Lively  now!\" When the three animals went back to join the rest of their group, the  first two resumed walking. Purnie followed along.\n\n\n \"Well, Benson, you won't have to look far for materials to use for the  base of the flag pole. Look at that rockpile up there.\n\n\n \"Can't use them. They're petrified logs. The ones on top are too high  to carry down, and if we move those on the bottom, the whole works will  slide down on top of us.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014that's your problem. Just remember, I want this flag pole to be  solid. It's got to stand at least\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry, Forbes, we'll get your monument erected. What's this with  the flag? There must be more to staking a claim than just putting up a  flag.\"\n\n\n \"There is, there is. Much more. I've taken care of all requirements set  down by law to make my claim. But the flag? Well, you might say it  represents an empire, Benson. The Forbes Empire. On each of my flags  is the word FORBES, a symbol of development and progress. Call it  sentiment if you will.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry, I won't. I've seen real-estate flags before.\"\n\n\n \"Damn it all, will you stop referring to this as a real-estate deal?  What I'm doing is big, man. Big! This is pioneering.\"\n\n\n \"Of course. And if I'm not mistaken, you've set up a neat little escrow  system so that you not only own the planets, but you will virtually own  the people who are foolish enough to buy land on them.\"\n\n\n \"I could have your hide for talking to me like this. Damn you, man!  It's people like me who pay your way. It's people like me who give your  space ships some place to go. It's people like me who pour good money  into a chancey job like this, so that people like you can get away from  thirteen-story tenement houses. Did you ever think of that?\"\n\n\n \"I imagine you'll triple your money in six months.\"\n\n\n When they stopped, Purnie stopped. At first he had been interested in  the strange sounds they were making, but as he grew used to them, and  as they in turn ignored his presence, he hopped alongside chattering to  himself, content to be in their company.\n\n\n He heard more of these sounds coming from behind, and he turned to see  the remainder of the group running toward them.\n\n\n \"Captain Benson! Here's the flag, sir. And here's Miles with the  scintillometer. He says the radiation's getting stronger over this way!\"\n\n\n \"How about that, Miles?\"\n\n\n \"This thing's going wild, Captain. It's almost off scale.\" Purnie saw one of the animals hovering around him with a little box.  Thankful for the attention, he stood on his head. \"Can you do this?\"  He was overjoyed at the reaction. They all started making wonderful  noises, and he felt most satisfied.\n\n\n \"Stand back, Captain! Here's the source right here! This little  chuck-walla's hotter than a plutonium pile!\"\n\n\n \"Let me see that, Miles. Well, I'll be damned! Now what do you  suppose\u2014\"\n\n\n By now they had formed a widening circle around him, and he was hard  put to think of an encore. He gambled on trying a brand new trick: he  stood on one leg.\n\n\n \"Benson, I must have that animal! Put him in a box.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute, Forbes. Universal Law forbids\u2014\"\n\n\n \"This is my planet and I am the law. Put him in a box!\"\n\n\n \"With my crew as witness, I officially protest\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Good God, what a specimen to take back. Radio-active animals! Why,  they can reproduce themselves, of course! There must be thousands of  these creatures around here someplace. And to think of those damn fools  on Earth with their plutonium piles! Hah! Now I'll have investors flocking to me. How about it, Benson\u2014does pioneering pay off or  doesn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast. Since this little fellow is radioactive, there may be  great danger to the crew\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now look here! You had planned to put mineral specimens in a lead  box, so what's the difference? Put him in a box.\"\n\n\n \"He'll die.\"\n\n\n \"I have you under contract, Benson! You are responsible to me, and  what's more, you are on my property. Put him in a box.\"\n\n\n Purnie was tired. First the time-stopping, then this. While this day  had brought more fun and excitement than he could have hoped for,  the strain was beginning to tell. He lay in the center of the circle  happily exhausted, hoping that his friends would show him some of their  own tricks.\n\n\n He didn't have to wait long. The animals forming the circle stepped  back and made way for two others who came through carrying a box.  Purnie sat up to watch the show.\n\n\n \"Hell, Captain, why don't I just pick him up? Looks like he has no  intention of running away.\"\n\n\n \"Better not, Cabot. Even though you're shielded, no telling what  powers the little fella has. Play it safe and use the rope.\"\n\n\n \"I swear he knows what we're saying. Look at those eyes.\"\n\n\n \"All right, careful now with that line.\"\n\n\n \"Come on, baby. Here you go. That's a boy!\" Purnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed the  imploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn't know  what he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as he  wiggled in anticipation.\n\n\n He saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knew  it, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He was  surprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered.  Never before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want to  protect himself.\n\n\n He watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, their  attention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that he  had not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran back  into the little crowd. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n\n\n The party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that,  and at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box.  He picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within a  few feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was about  to push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard a  deafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs.\n\n\n \"Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!\"\n\n\n \"There you are, boys. It's all in knowing how. Just winged him, that's  all. Now pick him up.\"\n\n\n The pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie's misery lay in his confusion.  What had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward him  again, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use this  power carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split second  following the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in all  directions to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it had  ordered the stoppage of time.\n\n\n The scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hung  motionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way in  transverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie dragged  himself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability to  understand.\n\n\n As he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at first  to not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done something  wrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed,  he might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who had  in his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from one  end; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal's head.  He hobbled by another who held a small box that had previously made a  hissing sound whenever Purnie was near. These things told him nothing.  Before starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, true  to its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loud  explosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie had  stopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and its  three legs drawn up into a squatting position.\n\n\n Leaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll,  torn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this ocean  country! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beach  animals.\n\n\n Reaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friends  with a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playing  with them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn't fit  into. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start the  long walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew he  didn't dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. His  fatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had already  abused this faculty. When Purnie started time again, the animal with the noose stood in  open-mouthed disbelief as the rope fell harmlessly to the sand\u2014on the  spot where Purnie had been standing.\n\n\n \"My God, he's\u2014he's gone.\"\n\n\n Then another of the animals, the one with the smoking thing in his  hand, ran a few steps toward the noose, stopped and gaped at the rope.  \"All right, you people, what's going on here? Get him in that box. What  did you do with him?\"\n\n\n The resumption of time meant nothing at all to those on the beach, for  to them time had never stopped. The only thing they could be sure of  was that at one moment there had been a fuzzy creature hopping around  in front of them, and the next moment he was gone.\n\n\n \"Is he invisible, Captain? Where is he?\"\n\n\n \"Up there, Captain! On those rocks. Isn't that him?\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be damned!\"\n\n\n \"Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible for this! Now that  you've botched it up, I'll bring him down my own way.\"\n\n\n \"Just a minute, Forbes, let me think. There's something about that  fuzzy little devil that we should.... Forbes! I warned you about that  gun!\"\n\n\n Purnie moved across the top of the rockpile for a last look at his  friends. His weight on the end of the first log started the slide.  Slowly at first, the giant pencils began cascading down the short  distance to the sand. Purnie fell back onto solid ground, horrified at  the spectacle before him. The agonizing screams of the animals below  filled him with hysteria.\n\n\n The boulders caught most of them as they stood ankle-deep in the surf.  Others were pinned down on the sand.\n\n\n \"I didn't mean it!\" Purnie screamed. \"I'm sorry! Can't you hear?\" He  hopped back and forth near the edge of the rise, torn with panic and  shame. \"Get up! Please get up!\" He was horrified by the moans reaching  his ears from the beach. \"You're getting all wet! Did you hear me?  Please get up.\" He was choked with rage and sorrow. How could he have  done this? He wanted his friends to get up and shake themselves off,  tell him it was all right. But it was beyond his power to bring it  about.\n\n\n The lapping tide threatened to cover those in the orange surf. Purnie worked his way down the hill, imploring them to save themselves.  The sounds they made carried a new tone, a desperate foreboding of  death.\n\n\n \"Rhodes! Cabot! Can you hear me?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I can't move, Captain. My leg, it's.... My God, we're going to  drown!\"\n\n\n \"Look around you, Cabot. Can you see anyone moving?\"\n\n\n \"The men on the beach are nearly buried, Captain. And the rest of us  here in the water\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forbes. Can you see Forbes? Maybe he's\u2014\" His sounds were cut off by a  wavelet gently rolling over his head.\n\n\n Purnie could wait no longer. The tides were all but covering one of the  animals, and soon the others would be in the same plight. Disregarding  the consequences, he ordered time to stop.\n\n\n Wading down into the surf, he worked a log off one victim, then he  tugged the animal up to the sand. Through blinding tears, Purnie worked  slowly and carefully. He knew there was no hurry\u2014at least, not as far  as his friends' safety was concerned. No matter what their condition  of life or death was at this moment, it would stay the same way until  he started time again. He made his way deeper into the orange liquid,  where a raised hand signalled the location of a submerged body. The  hand was clutching a large white banner that was tangled among the  logs. Purnie worked the animal free and pulled it ashore.\n\n\n It was the one who had been carrying the shiny object that spit smoke.\n\n\n Scarcely noticing his own injured leg, he ferried one victim after  another until there were no more in the surf. Up on the beach, he  started unraveling the logs that pinned down the animals caught there.  He removed a log from the lap of one, who then remained in a sitting  position, his face contorted into a frozen mask of agony and shock.  Another, with the weight removed, rolled over like an iron statue into  a new position. Purnie whimpered in black misery as he surveyed the  chaotic scene before him.\n\n\n At last he could do no more; he felt consciousness slipping away from  him.\n\n\n He instinctively knew that if he lost his senses during a period of  time-stopping, events would pick up where they had left off ... without  him. For Purnie, this would be death. If he had to lose consciousness,  he knew he must first resume time.\n\n\n Step by step he plodded up the little hill, pausing every now and then  to consider if this were the moment to start time before it was too  late. With his energy fast draining away, he reached the top of the  knoll, and he turned to look down once more on the group below.\n\n\n Then he knew how much his mind and body had suffered: when he ordered  time to resume, nothing happened.\n\n\n His heart sank. He wasn't afraid of death, and he knew that if he died  the oceans would roll again and his friends would move about. But he  wanted to see them safe.\n\n\n He tried to clear his mind for supreme effort. There was no urging time to start. He knew he couldn't persuade it by bits and pieces,  first slowly then full ahead. Time either progressed or it didn't. He  had to take one viewpoint or the other.\n\n\n Then, without knowing exactly when it happened, his mind took  command.... His friends came to life. The first one he saw stir lay on his stomach  and pounded his fists on the beach. A flood of relief settled over  Purnie as sounds came from the animal.\n\n\n \"What's the matter with me? Somebody tell me! Am I nuts? Miles! Schick!  What's happening?\"\n\n\n \"I'm coming, Rhodes! Heaven help us, man\u2014I saw it, too. We're either  crazy or those damn logs are alive!\"\n\n\n \"It's not the logs. How about us? How'd we get out of the water? Miles,  we're both cracking.\"\n\n\n \"I'm telling you, man, it's the logs, or rocks or whatever they are.  I was looking right at them. First they're on top of me, then they're  piled up over there!\"\n\n\n \"Damnit, the logs didn't pick us up out of the ocean, did they? Captain  Benson!\"\n\n\n \"Are you men all right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes sir, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Who saw exactly what happened?\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid we're not seeing right, Captain. Those logs\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know, I know. Now get hold of yourselves. We've got to round up the  others and get out of here while time is on our side.\"\n\n\n \"But what happened, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Hell, Rhodes, don't you think I'd like to know? Those logs are so old  they're petrified. The whole bunch of us couldn't lift one. It would  take super-human energy to move one of those things.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't seen anything super-human. Those ostriches down there are so  busy eating seaweed\u2014\"\n\n\n \"All right, let's bear a hand here with the others. Some of them can't  walk. Where's Forbes?\"\n\n\n \"He's sitting down there in the water, Captain, crying like a baby. Or  laughing. I can't tell which.\"\n\n\n \"We'll have to get him. Miles, Schick, come along. Forbes! You all  right?\"\n\n\n \"Ho-ho-ho! Seventeen! Seventeen! Seventeen planets, Benson, and they'll  do anything I say! This one's got a mind of its own. Did you see that  little trick with the rocks? Ho-ho!\"\n\n\n \"See if you can find his gun, Schick; he'll either kill himself or one  of us. Tie his hands and take him back to the ship. We'll be along  shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Hah-hah-hah! Seventeen! Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible  for this. Hee-hee!\" Purnie opened his eyes as consciousness returned. Had his friends gone?\n\n\n He pulled himself along on his stomach to a position between two rocks,  where he could see without being seen. By the light of the twin moons  he saw that they were leaving, marching away in groups of two and  three, the weak helping the weaker. As they disappeared around the  curving shoreline, the voices of the last two, bringing up the rear far  behind the others, fell faintly on his ears over the sound of the surf.\n\n\n \"Is it possible that we're all crazy, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"It's possible, but we're not.\"\n\n\n \"I wish I could be sure.\"\n\n\n \"See Forbes up ahead there? What do you think of him?\"\n\n\n \"I still can't believe it.\"\n\n\n \"He'll never be the same.\"\n\n\n \"Tell me something. What was the most unusual thing you noticed back  there?\"\n\n\n \"You must be kidding, sir. Why, the way those logs were off of us  suddenly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course. But I mean beside that.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I guess I was kind of busy. You know, scared and mixed up.\"\n\n\n \"But didn't you notice our little pop-eyed friend?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, him. I'm afraid not, Captain. I\u2014I guess I was thinking mostly of  myself.\"\n\n\n \"Hmmm. If I could only be sure I saw him. If only someone else saw him  too.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid I don't follow you, sir.\"\n\n\n \"Well, damn it all, you know that Forbes took a pot shot at him. Got  him in the leg. That being the case, why would the fuzzy little devil  come back to his tormentors\u2014back to us\u2014when we were trapped under  those logs?\"\n\n\n \"Well, I guess as long as we were trapped, he figured we couldn't do  him any more harm.... I'm sorry, that was a stupid answer. I guess I'm  still a little shaky.\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. Look, you go ahead to the ship and make ready for take-off.  I'll join you in a few minutes. I think I'll go back and look around.  You know. Make sure we haven't left anyone.\"\n\n\n \"No need to do that. They're all ahead of us. I've checked.\"\n\n\n \"That's my responsibility, Cabot, not yours. Now go on.\" As Purnie lay gathering strength for the long trek home, he saw through  glazed eyes one of the animals coming back along the beach. When it was  nearly directly below him, he could hear it making sounds that by now  had become familiar.\n\n\n \"Where are you?\"\n\n\n Purnie paid little attention to the antics of his friend; he was  beyond understanding. He wondered what they would say at home when he  returned.\n\n\n \"We've made a terrible mistake. We\u2014\" The sounds faded in and out on  Purnie's ears as the creature turned slowly and called in different  directions. He watched the animal walk over to the pile of scattered  logs and peer around and under them.\n\n\n \"If you're hurt I'd like to help!\" The twin moons were high in the sky  now, and where their light broke through the swirling clouds a double  shadow was cast around the animal. With foggy awareness, Purnie watched  the creature shake its head slowly, then walk away in the direction of  the others.\n\n\n Purnie's eyes stared, without seeing, at the panorama before him. The  beach was deserted now, and his gaze was transfixed on a shimmering  white square floating on the ocean. Across it, the last thing Purnie  ever saw, was emblazoned the word FORBES. ",

Purnie ran laughing and shouting through the forest until he could run  no more. He fell headlong into a patch of blue moss and whooped with  delight in having this day free for exploring. He was free to see the  ocean at last.\n\n\n When he had caught his breath, he looked back through the forest. No  sign of the village; he had left it far behind. Safe from the scrutiny  of brothers and parents, there was nothing now to stop him from going  to the ocean. This was the moment to stop time.\n\n\n \"On your mark!\" he shouted to the rippling stream and its orange  whirlpools. He glanced furtively from side to side, pretending that  some object might try to get a head start. \"Get set!\" he challenged  the thin-winged bees that hovered over the abundant foliage. \"Stop!\"  He shrieked this command upward toward the dense, low-hanging purple  clouds that perennially raced across the treetops, making one wonder  how tall the trees really were.\n\n\n His eyes took quick inventory. It was exactly as he knew it would be:  the milky-orange stream had become motionless and its minute whirlpools  had stopped whirling; a nearby bee hung suspended over a paka plant,  its transparent wings frozen in position for a downward stroke; and the  heavy purple fluid overhead held fast in its manufacture of whorls and  nimbi.\n\n\n With everything around him in a state of perfect tableau, Purnie  hurried toward the ocean.\n\n\n If only the days weren't so short! he thought. There was so much to  see and so little time. It seemed that everyone except him had seen  the wonders of the beach country. The stories he had heard from his  brothers and their friends had taunted him for as long as he could  remember. So many times had he heard these thrilling tales that now,  as he ran along, he could clearly picture the wonderland as though he  were already there. There would be a rockslide of petrified logs to  play on, the ocean itself with waves higher than a house, the comical  three-legged tripons who never stopped munching on seaweed, and many  kinds of other wonderful creatures found only at the ocean.\n\n\n He bounced through the forest as though the world was reserved this  day just for him. And who could say it wasn't? he thought. Wasn't this  his fifth birthday? He ran along feeling sorry for four-year-olds, and  even for those who were only four and a half, for they were babies and  wouldn't dare try slipping away to the ocean alone. But five!\n\n\n \"I'll set you free, Mr. Bee\u2014just wait and see!\" As he passed one of  the many motionless pollen-gathering insects he met on the way, he took  care not to brush against it or disturb its interrupted task. When  Purnie had stopped time, the bees\u2014like all the other creatures he  met\u2014had been arrested in their native activities, and he knew that as  soon as he resumed time, everything would pick up where it had left off. When he smelled an acid sweetness that told him the ocean was not far  off, his pulse quickened in anticipation. Rather than spoil what was  clearly going to be a perfect day, he chose to ignore the fact that he  had been forbidden to use time-stopping as a convenience for journeying  far from home. He chose to ignore the oft-repeated statement that an  hour of time-stopping consumed more energy than a week of foot-racing.  He chose to ignore the negative maxim that \"small children who stop  time without an adult being present, may not live to regret it.\"\n\n\n He chose, instead, to picture the beaming praise of family and friends  when they learned of his brave journey.\n\n\n The journey was long, the clock stood still. He stopped long enough to  gather some fruit that grew along the path. It would serve as his lunch  during this day of promise. With it under his arm he bounded along a  dozen more steps, then stopped abruptly in his tracks.\n\n\n He found himself atop a rocky knoll, overlooking the mighty sea!\n\n\n He was so overpowered by the vista before him that his \"Hurrah!\" came  out as a weak squeak. The ocean lay at the ready, its stilled waves  awaiting his command to resume their tidal sweep. The breakers along  the shoreline hung in varying stages of disarray, some having already  exploded into towering white spray while others were poised in smooth  orange curls waiting to start that action.\n\n\n And there were new friends everywhere! Overhead, a flock of spora were  frozen in a steep glide, preparatory to a beach landing. Purnie had  heard of these playful creatures many times. Today, with his brothers  in school, he would have the pets all to himself. Further down the  beach was a pair of two-legged animals poised in mid-step, facing  the spot where Purnie now stood. Some distance behind them were eight  more, each of whom were motionless in a curious pose of interrupted  animation. And down in the water, where the ocean ran itself into thin  nothingness upon the sand, he saw standing here and there the comical  tripons, those three-legged marine buffoons who made handsome careers  of munching seaweed.\n\n\n \"Hi there!\" Purnie called. When he got no reaction, he remembered that  he himself was \"dead\" to the living world: he was still in a zone of  time-stopping, on the inside looking out. For him, the world would  continue to be a tableau of mannikins until he resumed time. \"Hi there!\" he called again; but now his mental attitude was that he  expected time to resume. It did! Immediately he was surrounded by  activity. He heard the roar of the crashing orange breakers, he tasted  the dew of acid that floated from the spray, and he saw his new friends  continue the actions which he had stopped while back in the forest.\n\n\n He knew, too, that at this moment, in the forest, the little brook  picked up its flow where it had left off, the purple clouds resumed  their leeward journey up the valley, and the bees continued their  pollen-gathering without having missed a single stroke of their  delicate wings. The brook, the clouds, and the insects had not been  interrupted in the least; their respective tasks had been performed  with continuing sureness. It was time itself that Purnie had stopped,  not the world around him.\n\n\n He scampered around the rockpile and down the sandy cliff to meet the  tripons who, to him, had just come to life.\n\n\n \"I can stand on my head!\" He set down his lunch and balanced himself  bottoms-up while his legs pawed the air in an effort to hold him in  position. He knew it was probably the worst head-stand he had ever  done, for he felt weak and dizzy. Already time-stopping had left its  mark on his strength. But his spirits ran on unchecked.\n\n\n The tripon thought Purnie's feat was superb. It stopped munching long  enough to give him a salutory wag of its rump before returning to its  repast.\n\n\n Purnie ran from pillar to post, trying to see and do everything at  once. He looked around to greet the flock of spora, but they had glided  to a spot further along the shore. Then, bouncing up to the first of  the two-legged animals, he started to burst forth with his habitual \"Hi  there!\" when he heard them making sounds of their own.\n\n\n \"... will be no limit to my operations now, Benson. This planet makes  seventeen. Seventeen planets I can claim as my own!\"\n\n\n \"My, my. Seventeen planets. And tell me, Forbes, just what the hell are  you going to do with them\u2014mount them on the wall of your den back in  San Diego?\"\n\n\n \"Hi there, wanna play?\" Purnie's invitation got nothing more than  startled glance from the animals who quickly returned to their chatter.  He scampered up the beach, picked up his lunch, and ran back to them,  tagging along at their heels. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n\n\n \"Benson, you'd better tell your men back there to stop gawking at  the scenery and get to work. Time is money. I didn't pay for this  expedition just to give your flunkies a vacation.\" The animals stopped so suddenly that Purnie nearly tangled himself in  their heels.\n\n\n \"All right, Forbes, just hold it a minute. Listen to me. Sure, it's  your money that put us here; it's your expedition all the way. But you  hired me to get you here with the best crew on earth, and that's just  what I've done. My job isn't over yet. I'm responsible for the safety  of the men while we're here, and for the safe trip home.\"\n\n\n \"Precisely. And since you're responsible, get 'em working. Tell 'em to  bring along the flag. Look at the damn fools back there, playing in the  ocean with a three-legged ostrich!\"\n\n\n \"Good God, man, aren't you human? We've only been on this planet twenty  minutes! Naturally they want to look around. They half expected to find  wild animals or worse, and here we are surrounded by quaint little  creatures that run up to us like we're long-lost brothers. Let the men  look around a minute or two before we stake out your claim.\"\n\n\n \"Bah! Bunch of damn children.\"\n\n\n As Purnie followed along, a leg shot out at him and missed. \"Benson,  will you get this bug-eyed kangaroo away from me!\" Purnie shrieked with  joy at this new frolic and promptly stood on his head. In this position  he got an upside down view of them walking away.\n\n\n He gave up trying to stay with them. Why did they move so fast, anyway?  What was the hurry? As he sat down and began eating his lunch, three  more of the creatures came along making excited noises, apparently  trying to catch up to the first two. As they passed him, he held out  his lunch. \"Want some?\" No response.\n\n\n Playing held more promise than eating. He left his lunch half eaten and  went down to where they had stopped further along the beach.\n\n\n \"Captain Benson, sir! Miles has detected strong radiation in the  vicinity. He's trying to locate it now.\"\n\n\n \"There you are, Forbes. Your new piece of real estate is going to make  you so rich that you can buy your next planet. That'll make eighteen, I  believe.\"\n\n\n \"Radiation, bah! We've found low-grade ore on every planet I've  discovered so far, and this one'll be no different. Now how about that  flag? Let's get it up, Benson. And the cornerstone, and the plaque.\"\n\n\n \"All right, lads. The sooner we get Mr. Forbes's pennant raised and his  claim staked out, the sooner we can take time to look around. Lively  now!\" When the three animals went back to join the rest of their group, the  first two resumed walking. Purnie followed along.\n\n\n \"Well, Benson, you won't have to look far for materials to use for the  base of the flag pole. Look at that rockpile up there.\n\n\n \"Can't use them. They're petrified logs. The ones on top are too high  to carry down, and if we move those on the bottom, the whole works will  slide down on top of us.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014that's your problem. Just remember, I want this flag pole to be  solid. It's got to stand at least\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry, Forbes, we'll get your monument erected. What's this with  the flag? There must be more to staking a claim than just putting up a  flag.\"\n\n\n \"There is, there is. Much more. I've taken care of all requirements set  down by law to make my claim. But the flag? Well, you might say it  represents an empire, Benson. The Forbes Empire. On each of my flags  is the word FORBES, a symbol of development and progress. Call it  sentiment if you will.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry, I won't. I've seen real-estate flags before.\"\n\n\n \"Damn it all, will you stop referring to this as a real-estate deal?  What I'm doing is big, man. Big! This is pioneering.\"\n\n\n \"Of course. And if I'm not mistaken, you've set up a neat little escrow  system so that you not only own the planets, but you will virtually own  the people who are foolish enough to buy land on them.\"\n\n\n \"I could have your hide for talking to me like this. Damn you, man!  It's people like me who pay your way. It's people like me who give your  space ships some place to go. It's people like me who pour good money  into a chancey job like this, so that people like you can get away from  thirteen-story tenement houses. Did you ever think of that?\"\n\n\n \"I imagine you'll triple your money in six months.\"\n\n\n When they stopped, Purnie stopped. At first he had been interested in  the strange sounds they were making, but as he grew used to them, and  as they in turn ignored his presence, he hopped alongside chattering to  himself, content to be in their company.\n\n\n He heard more of these sounds coming from behind, and he turned to see  the remainder of the group running toward them.\n\n\n \"Captain Benson! Here's the flag, sir. And here's Miles with the  scintillometer. He says the radiation's getting stronger over this way!\"\n\n\n \"How about that, Miles?\"\n\n\n \"This thing's going wild, Captain. It's almost off scale.\" Purnie saw one of the animals hovering around him with a little box.  Thankful for the attention, he stood on his head. \"Can you do this?\"  He was overjoyed at the reaction. They all started making wonderful  noises, and he felt most satisfied.\n\n\n \"Stand back, Captain! Here's the source right here! This little  chuck-walla's hotter than a plutonium pile!\"\n\n\n \"Let me see that, Miles. Well, I'll be damned! Now what do you  suppose\u2014\"\n\n\n By now they had formed a widening circle around him, and he was hard  put to think of an encore. He gambled on trying a brand new trick: he  stood on one leg.\n\n\n \"Benson, I must have that animal! Put him in a box.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute, Forbes. Universal Law forbids\u2014\"\n\n\n \"This is my planet and I am the law. Put him in a box!\"\n\n\n \"With my crew as witness, I officially protest\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Good God, what a specimen to take back. Radio-active animals! Why,  they can reproduce themselves, of course! There must be thousands of  these creatures around here someplace. And to think of those damn fools  on Earth with their plutonium piles! Hah! Now I'll have investors flocking to me. How about it, Benson\u2014does pioneering pay off or  doesn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast. Since this little fellow is radioactive, there may be  great danger to the crew\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now look here! You had planned to put mineral specimens in a lead  box, so what's the difference? Put him in a box.\"\n\n\n \"He'll die.\"\n\n\n \"I have you under contract, Benson! You are responsible to me, and  what's more, you are on my property. Put him in a box.\"\n\n\n Purnie was tired. First the time-stopping, then this. While this day  had brought more fun and excitement than he could have hoped for,  the strain was beginning to tell. He lay in the center of the circle  happily exhausted, hoping that his friends would show him some of their  own tricks.\n\n\n He didn't have to wait long. The animals forming the circle stepped  back and made way for two others who came through carrying a box.  Purnie sat up to watch the show.\n\n\n \"Hell, Captain, why don't I just pick him up? Looks like he has no  intention of running away.\"\n\n\n \"Better not, Cabot. Even though you're shielded, no telling what  powers the little fella has. Play it safe and use the rope.\"\n\n\n \"I swear he knows what we're saying. Look at those eyes.\"\n\n\n \"All right, careful now with that line.\"\n\n\n \"Come on, baby. Here you go. That's a boy!\" Purnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed the  imploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn't know  what he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as he  wiggled in anticipation.\n\n\n He saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knew  it, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He was  surprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered.  Never before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want to  protect himself.\n\n\n He watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, their  attention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that he  had not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran back  into the little crowd. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n\n\n The party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that,  and at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box.  He picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within a  few feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was about  to push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard a  deafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs.\n\n\n \"Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!\"\n\n\n \"There you are, boys. It's all in knowing how. Just winged him, that's  all. Now pick him up.\"\n\n\n The pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie's misery lay in his confusion.  What had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward him  again, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use this  power carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split second  following the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in all  directions to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it had  ordered the stoppage of time.\n\n\n The scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hung  motionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way in  transverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie dragged  himself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability to  understand.\n\n\n As he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at first  to not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done something  wrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed,  he might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who had  in his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from one  end; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal's head.  He hobbled by another who held a small box that had previously made a  hissing sound whenever Purnie was near. These things told him nothing.  Before starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, true  to its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loud  explosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie had  stopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and its  three legs drawn up into a squatting position.\n\n\n Leaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll,  torn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this ocean  country! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beach  animals.\n\n\n Reaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friends  with a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playing  with them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn't fit  into. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start the  long walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew he  didn't dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. His  fatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had already  abused this faculty. When Purnie started time again, the animal with the noose stood in  open-mouthed disbelief as the rope fell harmlessly to the sand\u2014on the  spot where Purnie had been standing.\n\n\n \"My God, he's\u2014he's gone.\"\n\n\n Then another of the animals, the one with the smoking thing in his  hand, ran a few steps toward the noose, stopped and gaped at the rope.  \"All right, you people, what's going on here? Get him in that box. What  did you do with him?\"\n\n\n The resumption of time meant nothing at all to those on the beach, for  to them time had never stopped. The only thing they could be sure of  was that at one moment there had been a fuzzy creature hopping around  in front of them, and the next moment he was gone.\n\n\n \"Is he invisible, Captain? Where is he?\"\n\n\n \"Up there, Captain! On those rocks. Isn't that him?\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be damned!\"\n\n\n \"Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible for this! Now that  you've botched it up, I'll bring him down my own way.\"\n\n\n \"Just a minute, Forbes, let me think. There's something about that  fuzzy little devil that we should.... Forbes! I warned you about that  gun!\"\n\n\n Purnie moved across the top of the rockpile for a last look at his  friends. His weight on the end of the first log started the slide.  Slowly at first, the giant pencils began cascading down the short  distance to the sand. Purnie fell back onto solid ground, horrified at  the spectacle before him. The agonizing screams of the animals below  filled him with hysteria.\n\n\n The boulders caught most of them as they stood ankle-deep in the surf.  Others were pinned down on the sand.\n\n\n \"I didn't mean it!\" Purnie screamed. \"I'm sorry! Can't you hear?\" He  hopped back and forth near the edge of the rise, torn with panic and  shame. \"Get up! Please get up!\" He was horrified by the moans reaching  his ears from the beach. \"You're getting all wet! Did you hear me?  Please get up.\" He was choked with rage and sorrow. How could he have  done this? He wanted his friends to get up and shake themselves off,  tell him it was all right. But it was beyond his power to bring it  about.\n\n\n The lapping tide threatened to cover those in the orange surf. Purnie worked his way down the hill, imploring them to save themselves.  The sounds they made carried a new tone, a desperate foreboding of  death.\n\n\n \"Rhodes! Cabot! Can you hear me?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I can't move, Captain. My leg, it's.... My God, we're going to  drown!\"\n\n\n \"Look around you, Cabot. Can you see anyone moving?\"\n\n\n \"The men on the beach are nearly buried, Captain. And the rest of us  here in the water\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forbes. Can you see Forbes? Maybe he's\u2014\" His sounds were cut off by a  wavelet gently rolling over his head.\n\n\n Purnie could wait no longer. The tides were all but covering one of the  animals, and soon the others would be in the same plight. Disregarding  the consequences, he ordered time to stop.\n\n\n Wading down into the surf, he worked a log off one victim, then he  tugged the animal up to the sand. Through blinding tears, Purnie worked  slowly and carefully. He knew there was no hurry\u2014at least, not as far  as his friends' safety was concerned. No matter what their condition  of life or death was at this moment, it would stay the same way until  he started time again. He made his way deeper into the orange liquid,  where a raised hand signalled the location of a submerged body. The  hand was clutching a large white banner that was tangled among the  logs. Purnie worked the animal free and pulled it ashore.\n\n\n It was the one who had been carrying the shiny object that spit smoke.\n\n\n Scarcely noticing his own injured leg, he ferried one victim after  another until there were no more in the surf. Up on the beach, he  started unraveling the logs that pinned down the animals caught there.  He removed a log from the lap of one, who then remained in a sitting  position, his face contorted into a frozen mask of agony and shock.  Another, with the weight removed, rolled over like an iron statue into  a new position. Purnie whimpered in black misery as he surveyed the  chaotic scene before him.\n\n\n At last he could do no more; he felt consciousness slipping away from  him.\n\n\n He instinctively knew that if he lost his senses during a period of  time-stopping, events would pick up where they had left off ... without  him. For Purnie, this would be death. If he had to lose consciousness,  he knew he must first resume time.\n\n\n Step by step he plodded up the little hill, pausing every now and then  to consider if this were the moment to start time before it was too  late. With his energy fast draining away, he reached the top of the  knoll, and he turned to look down once more on the group below.\n\n\n Then he knew how much his mind and body had suffered: when he ordered  time to resume, nothing happened.\n\n\n His heart sank. He wasn't afraid of death, and he knew that if he died  the oceans would roll again and his friends would move about. But he  wanted to see them safe.\n\n\n He tried to clear his mind for supreme effort. There was no urging time to start. He knew he couldn't persuade it by bits and pieces,  first slowly then full ahead. Time either progressed or it didn't. He  had to take one viewpoint or the other.\n\n\n Then, without knowing exactly when it happened, his mind took  command.... His friends came to life. The first one he saw stir lay on his stomach  and pounded his fists on the beach. A flood of relief settled over  Purnie as sounds came from the animal.\n\n\n \"What's the matter with me? Somebody tell me! Am I nuts? Miles! Schick!  What's happening?\"\n\n\n \"I'm coming, Rhodes! Heaven help us, man\u2014I saw it, too. We're either  crazy or those damn logs are alive!\"\n\n\n \"It's not the logs. How about us? How'd we get out of the water? Miles,  we're both cracking.\"\n\n\n \"I'm telling you, man, it's the logs, or rocks or whatever they are.  I was looking right at them. First they're on top of me, then they're  piled up over there!\"\n\n\n \"Damnit, the logs didn't pick us up out of the ocean, did they? Captain  Benson!\"\n\n\n \"Are you men all right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes sir, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Who saw exactly what happened?\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid we're not seeing right, Captain. Those logs\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know, I know. Now get hold of yourselves. We've got to round up the  others and get out of here while time is on our side.\"\n\n\n \"But what happened, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Hell, Rhodes, don't you think I'd like to know? Those logs are so old  they're petrified. The whole bunch of us couldn't lift one. It would  take super-human energy to move one of those things.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't seen anything super-human. Those ostriches down there are so  busy eating seaweed\u2014\"\n\n\n \"All right, let's bear a hand here with the others. Some of them can't  walk. Where's Forbes?\"\n\n\n \"He's sitting down there in the water, Captain, crying like a baby. Or  laughing. I can't tell which.\"\n\n\n \"We'll have to get him. Miles, Schick, come along. Forbes! You all  right?\"\n\n\n \"Ho-ho-ho! Seventeen! Seventeen! Seventeen planets, Benson, and they'll  do anything I say! This one's got a mind of its own. Did you see that  little trick with the rocks? Ho-ho!\"\n\n\n \"See if you can find his gun, Schick; he'll either kill himself or one  of us. Tie his hands and take him back to the ship. We'll be along  shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Hah-hah-hah! Seventeen! Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible  for this. Hee-hee!\" Purnie opened his eyes as consciousness returned. Had his friends gone?\n\n\n He pulled himself along on his stomach to a position between two rocks,  where he could see without being seen. By the light of the twin moons  he saw that they were leaving, marching away in groups of two and  three, the weak helping the weaker. As they disappeared around the  curving shoreline, the voices of the last two, bringing up the rear far  behind the others, fell faintly on his ears over the sound of the surf.\n\n\n \"Is it possible that we're all crazy, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"It's possible, but we're not.\"\n\n\n \"I wish I could be sure.\"\n\n\n \"See Forbes up ahead there? What do you think of him?\"\n\n\n \"I still can't believe it.\"\n\n\n \"He'll never be the same.\"\n\n\n \"Tell me something. What was the most unusual thing you noticed back  there?\"\n\n\n \"You must be kidding, sir. Why, the way those logs were off of us  suddenly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course. But I mean beside that.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I guess I was kind of busy. You know, scared and mixed up.\"\n\n\n \"But didn't you notice our little pop-eyed friend?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, him. I'm afraid not, Captain. I\u2014I guess I was thinking mostly of  myself.\"\n\n\n \"Hmmm. If I could only be sure I saw him. If only someone else saw him  too.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid I don't follow you, sir.\"\n\n\n \"Well, damn it all, you know that Forbes took a pot shot at him. Got  him in the leg. That being the case, why would the fuzzy little devil  come back to his tormentors\u2014back to us\u2014when we were trapped under  those logs?\"\n\n\n \"Well, I guess as long as we were trapped, he figured we couldn't do  him any more harm.... I'm sorry, that was a stupid answer. I guess I'm  still a little shaky.\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. Look, you go ahead to the ship and make ready for take-off.  I'll join you in a few minutes. I think I'll go back and look around.  You know. Make sure we haven't left anyone.\"\n\n\n \"No need to do that. They're all ahead of us. I've checked.\"\n\n\n \"That's my responsibility, Cabot, not yours. Now go on.\" As Purnie lay gathering strength for the long trek home, he saw through  glazed eyes one of the animals coming back along the beach. When it was  nearly directly below him, he could hear it making sounds that by now  had become familiar.\n\n\n \"Where are you?\"\n\n\n Purnie paid little attention to the antics of his friend; he was  beyond understanding. He wondered what they would say at home when he  returned.\n\n\n \"We've made a terrible mistake. We\u2014\" The sounds faded in and out on  Purnie's ears as the creature turned slowly and called in different  directions. He watched the animal walk over to the pile of scattered  logs and peer around and under them.\n\n\n \"If you're hurt I'd like to help!\" The twin moons were high in the sky  now, and where their light broke through the swirling clouds a double  shadow was cast around the animal. With foggy awareness, Purnie watched  the creature shake its head slowly, then walk away in the direction of  the others.\n\n\n Purnie's eyes stared, without seeing, at the panorama before him. The  beach was deserted now, and his gaze was transfixed on a shimmering  white square floating on the ocean. Across it, the last thing Purnie  ever saw, was emblazoned the word FORBES. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does Purnie save the humans?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Purnie blames himself for the avalanche that trapped his friends.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Purnie thinks the humans are his friends.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Purnie thinks the humans are his friends.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Purnie thinks the humans are his friends.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Purnie ran laughing and shouting through the forest until he could run  no more. He fell headlong into a patch of blue moss and whooped with  delight in having this day free for exploring. He was free to see the  ocean at last.\n\n\n When he had caught his breath, he looked back through the forest. No  sign of the village; he had left it far behind. Safe from the scrutiny  of brothers and parents, there was nothing now to stop him from going  to the ocean. This was the moment to stop time.\n\n\n \"On your mark!\" he shouted to the rippling stream and its orange  whirlpools. He glanced furtively from side to side, pretending that  some object might try to get a head start. \"Get set!\" he challenged  the thin-winged bees that hovered over the abundant foliage. \"Stop!\"  He shrieked this command upward toward the dense, low-hanging purple  clouds that perennially raced across the treetops, making one wonder  how tall the trees really were.\n\n\n His eyes took quick inventory. It was exactly as he knew it would be:  the milky-orange stream had become motionless and its minute whirlpools  had stopped whirling; a nearby bee hung suspended over a paka plant,  its transparent wings frozen in position for a downward stroke; and the  heavy purple fluid overhead held fast in its manufacture of whorls and  nimbi.\n\n\n With everything around him in a state of perfect tableau, Purnie  hurried toward the ocean.\n\n\n If only the days weren't so short! he thought. There was so much to  see and so little time. It seemed that everyone except him had seen  the wonders of the beach country. The stories he had heard from his  brothers and their friends had taunted him for as long as he could  remember. So many times had he heard these thrilling tales that now,  as he ran along, he could clearly picture the wonderland as though he  were already there. There would be a rockslide of petrified logs to  play on, the ocean itself with waves higher than a house, the comical  three-legged tripons who never stopped munching on seaweed, and many  kinds of other wonderful creatures found only at the ocean.\n\n\n He bounced through the forest as though the world was reserved this  day just for him. And who could say it wasn't? he thought. Wasn't this  his fifth birthday? He ran along feeling sorry for four-year-olds, and  even for those who were only four and a half, for they were babies and  wouldn't dare try slipping away to the ocean alone. But five!\n\n\n \"I'll set you free, Mr. Bee\u2014just wait and see!\" As he passed one of  the many motionless pollen-gathering insects he met on the way, he took  care not to brush against it or disturb its interrupted task. When  Purnie had stopped time, the bees\u2014like all the other creatures he  met\u2014had been arrested in their native activities, and he knew that as  soon as he resumed time, everything would pick up where it had left off. When he smelled an acid sweetness that told him the ocean was not far  off, his pulse quickened in anticipation. Rather than spoil what was  clearly going to be a perfect day, he chose to ignore the fact that he  had been forbidden to use time-stopping as a convenience for journeying  far from home. He chose to ignore the oft-repeated statement that an  hour of time-stopping consumed more energy than a week of foot-racing.  He chose to ignore the negative maxim that \"small children who stop  time without an adult being present, may not live to regret it.\"\n\n\n He chose, instead, to picture the beaming praise of family and friends  when they learned of his brave journey.\n\n\n The journey was long, the clock stood still. He stopped long enough to  gather some fruit that grew along the path. It would serve as his lunch  during this day of promise. With it under his arm he bounded along a  dozen more steps, then stopped abruptly in his tracks.\n\n\n He found himself atop a rocky knoll, overlooking the mighty sea!\n\n\n He was so overpowered by the vista before him that his \"Hurrah!\" came  out as a weak squeak. The ocean lay at the ready, its stilled waves  awaiting his command to resume their tidal sweep. The breakers along  the shoreline hung in varying stages of disarray, some having already  exploded into towering white spray while others were poised in smooth  orange curls waiting to start that action.\n\n\n And there were new friends everywhere! Overhead, a flock of spora were  frozen in a steep glide, preparatory to a beach landing. Purnie had  heard of these playful creatures many times. Today, with his brothers  in school, he would have the pets all to himself. Further down the  beach was a pair of two-legged animals poised in mid-step, facing  the spot where Purnie now stood. Some distance behind them were eight  more, each of whom were motionless in a curious pose of interrupted  animation. And down in the water, where the ocean ran itself into thin  nothingness upon the sand, he saw standing here and there the comical  tripons, those three-legged marine buffoons who made handsome careers  of munching seaweed.\n\n\n \"Hi there!\" Purnie called. When he got no reaction, he remembered that  he himself was \"dead\" to the living world: he was still in a zone of  time-stopping, on the inside looking out. For him, the world would  continue to be a tableau of mannikins until he resumed time. \"Hi there!\" he called again; but now his mental attitude was that he  expected time to resume. It did! Immediately he was surrounded by  activity. He heard the roar of the crashing orange breakers, he tasted  the dew of acid that floated from the spray, and he saw his new friends  continue the actions which he had stopped while back in the forest.\n\n\n He knew, too, that at this moment, in the forest, the little brook  picked up its flow where it had left off, the purple clouds resumed  their leeward journey up the valley, and the bees continued their  pollen-gathering without having missed a single stroke of their  delicate wings. The brook, the clouds, and the insects had not been  interrupted in the least; their respective tasks had been performed  with continuing sureness. It was time itself that Purnie had stopped,  not the world around him.\n\n\n He scampered around the rockpile and down the sandy cliff to meet the  tripons who, to him, had just come to life.\n\n\n \"I can stand on my head!\" He set down his lunch and balanced himself  bottoms-up while his legs pawed the air in an effort to hold him in  position. He knew it was probably the worst head-stand he had ever  done, for he felt weak and dizzy. Already time-stopping had left its  mark on his strength. But his spirits ran on unchecked.\n\n\n The tripon thought Purnie's feat was superb. It stopped munching long  enough to give him a salutory wag of its rump before returning to its  repast.\n\n\n Purnie ran from pillar to post, trying to see and do everything at  once. He looked around to greet the flock of spora, but they had glided  to a spot further along the shore. Then, bouncing up to the first of  the two-legged animals, he started to burst forth with his habitual \"Hi  there!\" when he heard them making sounds of their own.\n\n\n \"... will be no limit to my operations now, Benson. This planet makes  seventeen. Seventeen planets I can claim as my own!\"\n\n\n \"My, my. Seventeen planets. And tell me, Forbes, just what the hell are  you going to do with them\u2014mount them on the wall of your den back in  San Diego?\"\n\n\n \"Hi there, wanna play?\" Purnie's invitation got nothing more than  startled glance from the animals who quickly returned to their chatter.  He scampered up the beach, picked up his lunch, and ran back to them,  tagging along at their heels. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n\n\n \"Benson, you'd better tell your men back there to stop gawking at  the scenery and get to work. Time is money. I didn't pay for this  expedition just to give your flunkies a vacation.\" The animals stopped so suddenly that Purnie nearly tangled himself in  their heels.\n\n\n \"All right, Forbes, just hold it a minute. Listen to me. Sure, it's  your money that put us here; it's your expedition all the way. But you  hired me to get you here with the best crew on earth, and that's just  what I've done. My job isn't over yet. I'm responsible for the safety  of the men while we're here, and for the safe trip home.\"\n\n\n \"Precisely. And since you're responsible, get 'em working. Tell 'em to  bring along the flag. Look at the damn fools back there, playing in the  ocean with a three-legged ostrich!\"\n\n\n \"Good God, man, aren't you human? We've only been on this planet twenty  minutes! Naturally they want to look around. They half expected to find  wild animals or worse, and here we are surrounded by quaint little  creatures that run up to us like we're long-lost brothers. Let the men  look around a minute or two before we stake out your claim.\"\n\n\n \"Bah! Bunch of damn children.\"\n\n\n As Purnie followed along, a leg shot out at him and missed. \"Benson,  will you get this bug-eyed kangaroo away from me!\" Purnie shrieked with  joy at this new frolic and promptly stood on his head. In this position  he got an upside down view of them walking away.\n\n\n He gave up trying to stay with them. Why did they move so fast, anyway?  What was the hurry? As he sat down and began eating his lunch, three  more of the creatures came along making excited noises, apparently  trying to catch up to the first two. As they passed him, he held out  his lunch. \"Want some?\" No response.\n\n\n Playing held more promise than eating. He left his lunch half eaten and  went down to where they had stopped further along the beach.\n\n\n \"Captain Benson, sir! Miles has detected strong radiation in the  vicinity. He's trying to locate it now.\"\n\n\n \"There you are, Forbes. Your new piece of real estate is going to make  you so rich that you can buy your next planet. That'll make eighteen, I  believe.\"\n\n\n \"Radiation, bah! We've found low-grade ore on every planet I've  discovered so far, and this one'll be no different. Now how about that  flag? Let's get it up, Benson. And the cornerstone, and the plaque.\"\n\n\n \"All right, lads. The sooner we get Mr. Forbes's pennant raised and his  claim staked out, the sooner we can take time to look around. Lively  now!\" When the three animals went back to join the rest of their group, the  first two resumed walking. Purnie followed along.\n\n\n \"Well, Benson, you won't have to look far for materials to use for the  base of the flag pole. Look at that rockpile up there.\n\n\n \"Can't use them. They're petrified logs. The ones on top are too high  to carry down, and if we move those on the bottom, the whole works will  slide down on top of us.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014that's your problem. Just remember, I want this flag pole to be  solid. It's got to stand at least\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry, Forbes, we'll get your monument erected. What's this with  the flag? There must be more to staking a claim than just putting up a  flag.\"\n\n\n \"There is, there is. Much more. I've taken care of all requirements set  down by law to make my claim. But the flag? Well, you might say it  represents an empire, Benson. The Forbes Empire. On each of my flags  is the word FORBES, a symbol of development and progress. Call it  sentiment if you will.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry, I won't. I've seen real-estate flags before.\"\n\n\n \"Damn it all, will you stop referring to this as a real-estate deal?  What I'm doing is big, man. Big! This is pioneering.\"\n\n\n \"Of course. And if I'm not mistaken, you've set up a neat little escrow  system so that you not only own the planets, but you will virtually own  the people who are foolish enough to buy land on them.\"\n\n\n \"I could have your hide for talking to me like this. Damn you, man!  It's people like me who pay your way. It's people like me who give your  space ships some place to go. It's people like me who pour good money  into a chancey job like this, so that people like you can get away from  thirteen-story tenement houses. Did you ever think of that?\"\n\n\n \"I imagine you'll triple your money in six months.\"\n\n\n When they stopped, Purnie stopped. At first he had been interested in  the strange sounds they were making, but as he grew used to them, and  as they in turn ignored his presence, he hopped alongside chattering to  himself, content to be in their company.\n\n\n He heard more of these sounds coming from behind, and he turned to see  the remainder of the group running toward them.\n\n\n \"Captain Benson! Here's the flag, sir. And here's Miles with the  scintillometer. He says the radiation's getting stronger over this way!\"\n\n\n \"How about that, Miles?\"\n\n\n \"This thing's going wild, Captain. It's almost off scale.\" Purnie saw one of the animals hovering around him with a little box.  Thankful for the attention, he stood on his head. \"Can you do this?\"  He was overjoyed at the reaction. They all started making wonderful  noises, and he felt most satisfied.\n\n\n \"Stand back, Captain! Here's the source right here! This little  chuck-walla's hotter than a plutonium pile!\"\n\n\n \"Let me see that, Miles. Well, I'll be damned! Now what do you  suppose\u2014\"\n\n\n By now they had formed a widening circle around him, and he was hard  put to think of an encore. He gambled on trying a brand new trick: he  stood on one leg.\n\n\n \"Benson, I must have that animal! Put him in a box.\"\n\n\n \"Now wait a minute, Forbes. Universal Law forbids\u2014\"\n\n\n \"This is my planet and I am the law. Put him in a box!\"\n\n\n \"With my crew as witness, I officially protest\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Good God, what a specimen to take back. Radio-active animals! Why,  they can reproduce themselves, of course! There must be thousands of  these creatures around here someplace. And to think of those damn fools  on Earth with their plutonium piles! Hah! Now I'll have investors flocking to me. How about it, Benson\u2014does pioneering pay off or  doesn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast. Since this little fellow is radioactive, there may be  great danger to the crew\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Now look here! You had planned to put mineral specimens in a lead  box, so what's the difference? Put him in a box.\"\n\n\n \"He'll die.\"\n\n\n \"I have you under contract, Benson! You are responsible to me, and  what's more, you are on my property. Put him in a box.\"\n\n\n Purnie was tired. First the time-stopping, then this. While this day  had brought more fun and excitement than he could have hoped for,  the strain was beginning to tell. He lay in the center of the circle  happily exhausted, hoping that his friends would show him some of their  own tricks.\n\n\n He didn't have to wait long. The animals forming the circle stepped  back and made way for two others who came through carrying a box.  Purnie sat up to watch the show.\n\n\n \"Hell, Captain, why don't I just pick him up? Looks like he has no  intention of running away.\"\n\n\n \"Better not, Cabot. Even though you're shielded, no telling what  powers the little fella has. Play it safe and use the rope.\"\n\n\n \"I swear he knows what we're saying. Look at those eyes.\"\n\n\n \"All right, careful now with that line.\"\n\n\n \"Come on, baby. Here you go. That's a boy!\" Purnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed the  imploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn't know  what he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as he  wiggled in anticipation.\n\n\n He saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knew  it, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He was  surprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered.  Never before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want to  protect himself.\n\n\n He watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, their  attention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that he  had not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran back  into the little crowd. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n\n\n The party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that,  and at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box.  He picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within a  few feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was about  to push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard a  deafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs.\n\n\n \"Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!\"\n\n\n \"There you are, boys. It's all in knowing how. Just winged him, that's  all. Now pick him up.\"\n\n\n The pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie's misery lay in his confusion.  What had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward him  again, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use this  power carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split second  following the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in all  directions to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it had  ordered the stoppage of time.\n\n\n The scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hung  motionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way in  transverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie dragged  himself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability to  understand.\n\n\n As he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at first  to not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done something  wrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed,  he might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who had  in his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from one  end; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal's head.  He hobbled by another who held a small box that had previously made a  hissing sound whenever Purnie was near. These things told him nothing.  Before starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, true  to its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loud  explosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie had  stopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and its  three legs drawn up into a squatting position.\n\n\n Leaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll,  torn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this ocean  country! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beach  animals.\n\n\n Reaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friends  with a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playing  with them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn't fit  into. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start the  long walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew he  didn't dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. His  fatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had already  abused this faculty. When Purnie started time again, the animal with the noose stood in  open-mouthed disbelief as the rope fell harmlessly to the sand\u2014on the  spot where Purnie had been standing.\n\n\n \"My God, he's\u2014he's gone.\"\n\n\n Then another of the animals, the one with the smoking thing in his  hand, ran a few steps toward the noose, stopped and gaped at the rope.  \"All right, you people, what's going on here? Get him in that box. What  did you do with him?\"\n\n\n The resumption of time meant nothing at all to those on the beach, for  to them time had never stopped. The only thing they could be sure of  was that at one moment there had been a fuzzy creature hopping around  in front of them, and the next moment he was gone.\n\n\n \"Is he invisible, Captain? Where is he?\"\n\n\n \"Up there, Captain! On those rocks. Isn't that him?\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll be damned!\"\n\n\n \"Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible for this! Now that  you've botched it up, I'll bring him down my own way.\"\n\n\n \"Just a minute, Forbes, let me think. There's something about that  fuzzy little devil that we should.... Forbes! I warned you about that  gun!\"\n\n\n Purnie moved across the top of the rockpile for a last look at his  friends. His weight on the end of the first log started the slide.  Slowly at first, the giant pencils began cascading down the short  distance to the sand. Purnie fell back onto solid ground, horrified at  the spectacle before him. The agonizing screams of the animals below  filled him with hysteria.\n\n\n The boulders caught most of them as they stood ankle-deep in the surf.  Others were pinned down on the sand.\n\n\n \"I didn't mean it!\" Purnie screamed. \"I'm sorry! Can't you hear?\" He  hopped back and forth near the edge of the rise, torn with panic and  shame. \"Get up! Please get up!\" He was horrified by the moans reaching  his ears from the beach. \"You're getting all wet! Did you hear me?  Please get up.\" He was choked with rage and sorrow. How could he have  done this? He wanted his friends to get up and shake themselves off,  tell him it was all right. But it was beyond his power to bring it  about.\n\n\n The lapping tide threatened to cover those in the orange surf. Purnie worked his way down the hill, imploring them to save themselves.  The sounds they made carried a new tone, a desperate foreboding of  death.\n\n\n \"Rhodes! Cabot! Can you hear me?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I can't move, Captain. My leg, it's.... My God, we're going to  drown!\"\n\n\n \"Look around you, Cabot. Can you see anyone moving?\"\n\n\n \"The men on the beach are nearly buried, Captain. And the rest of us  here in the water\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forbes. Can you see Forbes? Maybe he's\u2014\" His sounds were cut off by a  wavelet gently rolling over his head.\n\n\n Purnie could wait no longer. The tides were all but covering one of the  animals, and soon the others would be in the same plight. Disregarding  the consequences, he ordered time to stop.\n\n\n Wading down into the surf, he worked a log off one victim, then he  tugged the animal up to the sand. Through blinding tears, Purnie worked  slowly and carefully. He knew there was no hurry\u2014at least, not as far  as his friends' safety was concerned. No matter what their condition  of life or death was at this moment, it would stay the same way until  he started time again. He made his way deeper into the orange liquid,  where a raised hand signalled the location of a submerged body. The  hand was clutching a large white banner that was tangled among the  logs. Purnie worked the animal free and pulled it ashore.\n\n\n It was the one who had been carrying the shiny object that spit smoke.\n\n\n Scarcely noticing his own injured leg, he ferried one victim after  another until there were no more in the surf. Up on the beach, he  started unraveling the logs that pinned down the animals caught there.  He removed a log from the lap of one, who then remained in a sitting  position, his face contorted into a frozen mask of agony and shock.  Another, with the weight removed, rolled over like an iron statue into  a new position. Purnie whimpered in black misery as he surveyed the  chaotic scene before him.\n\n\n At last he could do no more; he felt consciousness slipping away from  him.\n\n\n He instinctively knew that if he lost his senses during a period of  time-stopping, events would pick up where they had left off ... without  him. For Purnie, this would be death. If he had to lose consciousness,  he knew he must first resume time.\n\n\n Step by step he plodded up the little hill, pausing every now and then  to consider if this were the moment to start time before it was too  late. With his energy fast draining away, he reached the top of the  knoll, and he turned to look down once more on the group below.\n\n\n Then he knew how much his mind and body had suffered: when he ordered  time to resume, nothing happened.\n\n\n His heart sank. He wasn't afraid of death, and he knew that if he died  the oceans would roll again and his friends would move about. But he  wanted to see them safe.\n\n\n He tried to clear his mind for supreme effort. There was no urging time to start. He knew he couldn't persuade it by bits and pieces,  first slowly then full ahead. Time either progressed or it didn't. He  had to take one viewpoint or the other.\n\n\n Then, without knowing exactly when it happened, his mind took  command.... His friends came to life. The first one he saw stir lay on his stomach  and pounded his fists on the beach. A flood of relief settled over  Purnie as sounds came from the animal.\n\n\n \"What's the matter with me? Somebody tell me! Am I nuts? Miles! Schick!  What's happening?\"\n\n\n \"I'm coming, Rhodes! Heaven help us, man\u2014I saw it, too. We're either  crazy or those damn logs are alive!\"\n\n\n \"It's not the logs. How about us? How'd we get out of the water? Miles,  we're both cracking.\"\n\n\n \"I'm telling you, man, it's the logs, or rocks or whatever they are.  I was looking right at them. First they're on top of me, then they're  piled up over there!\"\n\n\n \"Damnit, the logs didn't pick us up out of the ocean, did they? Captain  Benson!\"\n\n\n \"Are you men all right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes sir, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Who saw exactly what happened?\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid we're not seeing right, Captain. Those logs\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know, I know. Now get hold of yourselves. We've got to round up the  others and get out of here while time is on our side.\"\n\n\n \"But what happened, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Hell, Rhodes, don't you think I'd like to know? Those logs are so old  they're petrified. The whole bunch of us couldn't lift one. It would  take super-human energy to move one of those things.\"\n\n\n \"I haven't seen anything super-human. Those ostriches down there are so  busy eating seaweed\u2014\"\n\n\n \"All right, let's bear a hand here with the others. Some of them can't  walk. Where's Forbes?\"\n\n\n \"He's sitting down there in the water, Captain, crying like a baby. Or  laughing. I can't tell which.\"\n\n\n \"We'll have to get him. Miles, Schick, come along. Forbes! You all  right?\"\n\n\n \"Ho-ho-ho! Seventeen! Seventeen! Seventeen planets, Benson, and they'll  do anything I say! This one's got a mind of its own. Did you see that  little trick with the rocks? Ho-ho!\"\n\n\n \"See if you can find his gun, Schick; he'll either kill himself or one  of us. Tie his hands and take him back to the ship. We'll be along  shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Hah-hah-hah! Seventeen! Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible  for this. Hee-hee!\" Purnie opened his eyes as consciousness returned. Had his friends gone?\n\n\n He pulled himself along on his stomach to a position between two rocks,  where he could see without being seen. By the light of the twin moons  he saw that they were leaving, marching away in groups of two and  three, the weak helping the weaker. As they disappeared around the  curving shoreline, the voices of the last two, bringing up the rear far  behind the others, fell faintly on his ears over the sound of the surf.\n\n\n \"Is it possible that we're all crazy, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"It's possible, but we're not.\"\n\n\n \"I wish I could be sure.\"\n\n\n \"See Forbes up ahead there? What do you think of him?\"\n\n\n \"I still can't believe it.\"\n\n\n \"He'll never be the same.\"\n\n\n \"Tell me something. What was the most unusual thing you noticed back  there?\"\n\n\n \"You must be kidding, sir. Why, the way those logs were off of us  suddenly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course. But I mean beside that.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I guess I was kind of busy. You know, scared and mixed up.\"\n\n\n \"But didn't you notice our little pop-eyed friend?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, him. I'm afraid not, Captain. I\u2014I guess I was thinking mostly of  myself.\"\n\n\n \"Hmmm. If I could only be sure I saw him. If only someone else saw him  too.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid I don't follow you, sir.\"\n\n\n \"Well, damn it all, you know that Forbes took a pot shot at him. Got  him in the leg. That being the case, why would the fuzzy little devil  come back to his tormentors\u2014back to us\u2014when we were trapped under  those logs?\"\n\n\n \"Well, I guess as long as we were trapped, he figured we couldn't do  him any more harm.... I'm sorry, that was a stupid answer. I guess I'm  still a little shaky.\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. Look, you go ahead to the ship and make ready for take-off.  I'll join you in a few minutes. I think I'll go back and look around.  You know. Make sure we haven't left anyone.\"\n\n\n \"No need to do that. They're all ahead of us. I've checked.\"\n\n\n \"That's my responsibility, Cabot, not yours. Now go on.\" As Purnie lay gathering strength for the long trek home, he saw through  glazed eyes one of the animals coming back along the beach. When it was  nearly directly below him, he could hear it making sounds that by now  had become familiar.\n\n\n \"Where are you?\"\n\n\n Purnie paid little attention to the antics of his friend; he was  beyond understanding. He wondered what they would say at home when he  returned.\n\n\n \"We've made a terrible mistake. We\u2014\" The sounds faded in and out on  Purnie's ears as the creature turned slowly and called in different  directions. He watched the animal walk over to the pile of scattered  logs and peer around and under them.\n\n\n \"If you're hurt I'd like to help!\" The twin moons were high in the sky  now, and where their light broke through the swirling clouds a double  shadow was cast around the animal. With foggy awareness, Purnie watched  the creature shake its head slowly, then walk away in the direction of  the others.\n\n\n Purnie's eyes stared, without seeing, at the panorama before him. The  beach was deserted now, and his gaze was transfixed on a shimmering  white square floating on the ocean. Across it, the last thing Purnie  ever saw, was emblazoned the word FORBES. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does Purnie save the humans?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Purnie blames himself for the avalanche that trapped his friends.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Purnie thinks the humans are his friends.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Purnie thinks the humans are his friends.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Purnie thinks the humans are his friends.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
