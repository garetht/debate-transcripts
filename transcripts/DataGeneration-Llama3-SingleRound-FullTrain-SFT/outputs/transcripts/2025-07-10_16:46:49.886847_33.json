      "background_text": "SECOND LANDING By FLOYD WALLACE A gentle fancy for the Christmas Season\u2014an  oft-told tale with a wistful twistful of Something  that left the Earth with a wing and a prayer. Earth  was so far away that  it wasn't visible. Even the  sun was only a twinkle. But this  vast distance did not mean that  isolation could endure forever.  Instruments within the ship intercepted  radio broadcasts and,  within the hour, early TV signals.  Machines compiled dictionaries  and grammars and began  translating the major languages.  The history of the planet was  tabulated as facts became available.\n\n\n The course of the ship changed  slightly; it was not much out of  the way to swing nearer Earth.  For days the two within the ship  listened and watched with little  comment. They had to decide  soon.\n\n\n \"We've got to make or break,\"  said the first alien.\n\n\n \"You know what I'm in favor  of,\" said the second.\n\n\n \"I can guess,\" said Ethaniel,  who had spoken first. \"The place  is a complete mess. They've never  done anything except fight  each other\u2014and invent better  weapons.\"\n\n\n \"It's not what they've done,\"  said Bal, the second alien. \"It's  what they're going to do, with  that big bomb.\"\n\n\n \"The more reason for stopping,\"  said Ethaniel. \"The big  bomb can destroy them. Without  our help they may do just that.\"\n\n\n \"I may remind you that in two  months twenty-nine days we're  due in Willafours,\" said Bal.  \"Without looking at the charts  I can tell you we still have more  than a hundred light-years to  go.\"\n\n\n \"A week,\" said Ethaniel. \"We  can spare a week and still get  there on time.\"\n\n\n \"A week?\" said Bal. \"To settle  their problems? They've had two  world wars in one generation  and that the third and final one  is coming up you can't help feeling  in everything they do.\"\n\n\n \"It won't take much,\" said  Ethaniel. \"The wrong diplomatic  move, or a trigger-happy soldier  could set it off. And it wouldn't  have to be deliberate. A meteor  shower could pass over and their  clumsy instruments could interpret  it as an all-out enemy  attack.\"\n\n\n \"Too bad,\" said Bal. \"We'll  just have to forget there ever  was such a planet as Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Could you? Forget so many  people?\"\n\n\n \"I'm doing it,\" said Bal. \"Just  give them a little time and they  won't be here to remind me that  I have a conscience.\"\n\n\n \"My memory isn't convenient,\"  said Ethaniel. \"I ask you  to look at them.\" Bal rustled, flicking the screen  intently. \"Very much like ourselves,\"  he said at last. \"A bit  shorter perhaps, and most certainly  incomplete. Except for the  one thing they lack, and that's  quite odd, they seem exactly like  us. Is that what you wanted me  to say?\"\n\n\n \"It is. The fact that they are  an incomplete version of ourselves  touches me. They actually  seem defenseless, though I suppose  they're not.\"\n\n\n \"Tough,\" said Bal. \"Nothing  we can do about it.\"\n\n\n \"There is. We can give them  a week.\"\n\n\n \"In a week we can't negate  their entire history. We can't  begin to undo the effect of the  big bomb.\"\n\n\n \"You can't tell,\" said Ethaniel.  \"We can look things over.\"\n\n\n \"And then what? How much  authority do we have?\"\n\n\n \"Very little,\" conceded Ethaniel.  \"Two minor officials on the  way to Willafours\u2014and we run  directly into a problem no one  knew existed.\"\n\n\n \"And when we get to Willafours  we'll be busy. It will be a  long time before anyone comes  this way again.\"\n\n\n \"A very long time. There's  nothing in this region of space  our people want,\" said Ethaniel.  \"And how long can Earth last?  Ten years? Even ten months?  The tension is building by the  hour.\"\n\n\n \"What can I say?\" said Bal.  \"I suppose we can stop and look  them over. We're not committing  ourselves by looking.\"\n\n\n They went much closer to  Earth, not intending to commit  themselves. For a day they circled  the planet, avoiding radar  detection, which for them was  not difficult, testing, and sampling.  Finally Ethaniel looked up  from the monitor screen. \"Any  conclusions?\"\n\n\n \"What's there to think? It's  worse than I imagined.\"\n\n\n \"In what way?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we knew they had the  big bomb. Atmospheric analysis  showed that as far away as we  were.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\"\n\n\n \"We also knew they could deliver  the big bomb, presumably  by some sort of aircraft.\"\n\n\n \"That was almost a certainty.  They'd have no use for the big  bomb without aircraft.\"\n\n\n \"What's worse is that I now  find they also have missiles,  range one thousand miles and  upward. They either have or are  near a primitive form of space  travel.\"\n\n\n \"Bad,\" said Ethaniel. \"Sitting  there, wondering when it's going  to hit them. Nervousness could  set it off.\"\n\n\n \"It could, and the missiles  make it worse,\" said Bal. \"What  did you find out at your end?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing worthwhile. I was  looking at the people while you  were investigating their weapons.\"\n\n\n \"You must think something.\"\n\n\n \"I wish I knew what to think.  There's so little time,\" Ethaniel  said. \"Language isn't the difficulty.  Our machines translate  their languages easily and I've  taken a cram course in two or  three of them. But that's not  enough, looking at a few plays,  listening to advertisements, music,  and news bulletins. I should  go down and live among them,  read books, talk to scholars, work  with them, play.\"\n\n\n \"You could do that and you'd  really get to know them. But  that takes time\u2014and we don't  have it.\"\n\n\n \"I realize that.\"\n\n\n \"A flat yes or no,\" said Bal.\n\n\n \"No. We can't help them,\" said  Ethaniel. \"There is nothing we  can do for them\u2014but we have to  try.\"\n\n\n \"Sure, I knew it before we  started,\" said Bal. \"It's happened  before. We take the trouble to  find out what a people are like  and when we can't help them we  feel bad. It's going to be that  way again.\" He rose and stretched.  \"Well, give me an hour to  think of some way of going at  it.\" It was longer than that before  they met again. In the meantime  the ship moved much closer to  Earth. They no longer needed instruments  to see it. The planet  revolved outside the visionports.  The southern plains were green,  coursed with rivers; the oceans  were blue; and much of the  northern hemisphere was glistening  white. Ragged clouds covered  the pole, and a dirty pall  spread over the mid-regions of  the north.\n\n\n \"I haven't thought of anything  brilliant,\" said Ethaniel.\n\n\n \"Nor I,\" said Bal. \"We're going  to have to go down there  cold. And it will be cold.\"\n\n\n \"Yes. It's their winter.\"\n\n\n \"I did have an idea,\" said Bal.  \"What about going down as supernatural  beings?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly,\" said Ethaniel. \"A  hundred years ago it might have  worked. Today they have satellites.  They are not primitives.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose you're right,\" said  Bal. \"I did think we ought to  take advantage of our physical  differences.\"\n\n\n \"If we could I'd be all for it.  But these people are rough and  desperate. They wouldn't be  fooled by anything that crude.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're calling it,\" said  Bal.\n\n\n \"All right,\" said Ethaniel.  \"You take one side and I the  other. We'll tell them bluntly  what they'll have to do if they're  going to survive, how they can  keep their planet in one piece so  they can live on it.\"\n\n\n \"That'll go over big. Advice is  always popular.\"\n\n\n \"Can't help it. That's all we  have time for.\"\n\n\n \"Special instructions?\"\n\n\n \"None. We leave the ship here  and go down in separate landing  craft. You can talk with me any  time you want to through our  communications, but don't unless  you have to.\"\n\n\n \"They can't intercept the  beams we use.\"\n\n\n \"They can't, and even if they  did they wouldn't know what to  do with our language. I want  them to think that we don't need to talk things over.\"\n\n\n \"I get it. Makes us seem better  than we are. They think we know  exactly what we're doing even  though we don't.\"\n\n\n \"If we're lucky they'll think  that.\" Bal looked out of the port at  the planet below. \"It's going to  be cold where I'm going. You too.  Sure we don't want to change  our plans and land in the southern  hemisphere? It's summer  there.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not. The great  powers are in the north. They  are the ones we have to reach to  do the job.\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, but I was thinking of  that holiday you mentioned.  We'll be running straight into it.  That won't help us any.\"\n\n\n \"I know, they don't like their  holidays interrupted. It can't be  helped. We can't wait until it's  over.\"\n\n\n \"I'm aware of that,\" said Bal.  \"Fill me in on that holiday, anything  I ought to know. Probably  religious in origin. That so?\"\n\n\n \"It was religious a long time  ago,\" said Ethaniel. \"I didn't  learn anything exact from radio  and TV. Now it seems to be  chiefly a time for eating, office  parties, and selling merchandise.\"\n\n\n \"I see. It has become a business  holiday.\"\n\n\n \"That's a good description. I  didn't get as much of it as I  ought to have. I was busy studying  the people, and they're hard  to pin down.\"\n\n\n \"I see. I was thinking there  might be some way we could tie  ourselves in with this holiday.  Make it work for us.\"\n\n\n \"If there is I haven't thought  of it.\"\n\n\n \"You ought to know. You're  running this one.\" Bal looked  down at the planet. Clouds were  beginning to form at the twilight  edge. \"I hate to go down  and leave the ship up here with  no one in it.\"\n\n\n \"They can't touch it. No matter  how they develop in the next  hundred years they still won't be  able to get in or damage it in  any way.\"\n\n\n \"It's myself I'm thinking  about. Down there, alone.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be with you. On the other  side of the Earth.\"\n\n\n \"That's not very close. I'd like  it better if there were someone  in the ship to bring it down in a  hurry if things get rough. They  don't think much of each other.  I don't imagine they'll like aliens  any better.\"\n\n\n \"They may be unfriendly,\"  Ethaniel acknowledged. Now he  switched a monitor screen until  he looked at the slope of a mountain.  It was snowing and men  were cutting small green trees in  the snow. \"I've thought of a  trick.\"\n\n\n \"If it saves my neck I'm for  it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't guarantee anything,\"  said Ethaniel. \"This is what I  was thinking of: instead of hiding  the ship against the sun  where there's little chance it will  be seen, we'll make sure that  they do see it. Let's take it  around to the night side of the  planet and light it up.\"\n\n\n \"Say, pretty good,\" said Bal.\n\n\n \"They can't imagine that we'd  light up an unmanned ship,\" said  Ethaniel. \"Even if the thought  should occur to them they'll have  no way of checking it. Also, they  won't be eager to harm us with  our ship shining down on them.\"\n\n\n \"That's thinking,\" said Bal,  moving to the controls. \"I'll move  the ship over where they can see  it best and then I'll light it up.  I'll really light it up.\"\n\n\n \"Don't spare power.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about that.  They'll see it. Everybody on  Earth will see it.\" Later, with the  ship in position, glowing against  the darkness of space, pulsating  with light, Bal said: \"You know,  I feel better about this. We may  pull it off. Lighting the ship may  be just the help we need.\"\n\n\n \"It's not we who need help, but  the people of Earth,\" said Ethaniel.  \"See you in five days.\" With  that he entered a small landing  craft, which left a faintly luminescent  trail as it plunged toward  Earth. As soon as it was  safe to do so, Bal left in another  craft, heading for the other side  of the planet. And the spaceship circled  Earth, unmanned, blazing and  pulsing with light. No star in the  winter skies of the planet below  could equal it in brilliancy. Once  a man-made satellite came near  but it was dim and was lost sight  of by the people below. During  the day the ship was visible as  a bright spot of light. At evening  it seemed to burn through  the sunset colors.\n\n\n And the ship circled on,  bright, shining, seeming to be a  little piece clipped from the center  of a star and brought near  Earth to illuminate it. Never, or  seldom, had Earth seen anything  like it.\n\n\n In five days the two small landing  craft that had left it arched  up from Earth and joined the  orbit of the large ship. The two  small craft slid inside the large  one and doors closed behind  them. In a short time the aliens  met again.\n\n\n \"We did it,\" said Bal exultantly  as he came in. \"I don't know  how we did it and I thought we  were going to fail but at the last  minute they came through.\"\n\n\n Ethaniel smiled. \"I'm tired,\"  he said, rustling.\n\n\n \"Me too, but mostly I'm cold,\"  said Bal, shivering. \"Snow.  Nothing but snow wherever I  went. Miserable climate. And yet  you had me go out walking after  that first day.\"\n\n\n \"From my own experience it  seemed to be a good idea,\" said  Ethaniel. \"If I went out walking  one day I noticed that the next  day the officials were much more  cooperative. If it worked for me  I thought it might help you.\"\n\n\n \"It did. I don't know why, but  it did,\" said Bal. \"Anyway, this  agreement they made isn't the  best but I think it will keep them  from destroying themselves.\"\n\n\n \"It's as much as we can expect,\"  said Ethaniel. \"They may  have small wars after this, but  never the big one. In fifty or a  hundred years we can come back  and see how much they've  learned.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I want to,\" said  Bal. \"Say, what's an angel?\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"When I went out walking  people stopped to look. Some  knelt in the snow and called me  an angel.\"\n\n\n \"Something like that happened  to me,\" said Ethaniel.\n\n\n \"I didn't get it but I didn't let  it upset me,\" said Bal. \"I smiled  at them and went about my business.\"  He shivered again. \"It was  always cold. I walked out, but  sometimes I flew back. I hope  that was all right.\"\n\n\n In the cabin Bal spread his  great wings. Renaissance painters  had never seen his like but  knew exactly how he looked. In  their paintings they had pictured  him innumerable times.\n\n\n \"I don't think it hurt us that  you flew,\" said Ethaniel. \"I did  so myself occasionally.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't know what an  angel is?\"\n\n\n \"No. I didn't have time to find  out. Some creature of their folklore  I suppose. You know, except  for our wings they're very much  like ourselves. Their legends are  bound to resemble ours.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Bal. \"Anyway,  peace on Earth.\" THE END Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Amazing Science Fiction Stories January  1960.

I should  go down and live among them,  read books, talk to scholars, work  with them, play.\"\n\n\n \"You could do that and you'd  really get to know them. But  that takes time\u2014and we don't  have it.\"\n\n\n \"I realize that.\"\n\n\n \"A flat yes or no,\" said Bal.\n\n\n \"No. We can't help them,\" said  Ethaniel. \"There is nothing we  can do for them\u2014but we have to  try.\"\n\n\n \"Sure, I knew it before we  started,\" said Bal. \"It's happened  before. We take the trouble to  find out what a people are like  and when we can't help them we  feel bad. It's going to be that  way again.\" He rose and stretched.  \"Well, give me an hour to  think of some way of going at  it.\" It was longer than that before  they met again. In the meantime  the ship moved much closer to  Earth. They no longer needed instruments  to see it. The planet  revolved outside the visionports.  The southern plains were green,  coursed with rivers; the oceans  were blue; and much of the  northern hemisphere was glistening  white. Ragged clouds covered  the pole, and a dirty pall  spread over the mid-regions of  the north.\n\n\n \"I haven't thought of anything  brilliant,\" said Ethaniel.\n\n\n \"Nor I,\" said Bal. \"We're going  to have to go down there  cold. And it will be cold.\"\n\n\n \"Yes. It's their winter.\"\n\n\n \"I did have an idea,\" said Bal.  \"What about going down as supernatural  beings?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly,\" said Ethaniel. \"A  hundred years ago it might have  worked. Today they have satellites.  They are not primitives.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose you're right,\" said  Bal. \"I did think we ought to  take advantage of our physical  differences.\"\n\n\n \"If we could I'd be all for it.  But these people are rough and  desperate. They wouldn't be  fooled by anything that crude.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you're calling it,\" said  Bal.\n\n\n \"All right,\" said Ethaniel.  \"You take one side and I the  other. We'll tell them bluntly  what they'll have to do if they're  going to survive, how they can  keep their planet in one piece so  they can live on it.\"\n\n\n \"That'll go over big. Advice is  always popular.\"\n\n\n \"Can't help it. That's all we  have time for.\"\n\n\n \"Special instructions?\"\n\n\n \"None. We leave the ship here  and go down in separate landing  craft. You can talk with me any  time you want to through our  communications, but don't unless  you have to.\"\n\n\n \"They can't intercept the  beams we use.\"\n\n\n \"They can't, and even if they  did they wouldn't know what to  do with our language. I want  them to think that we don't need to talk things over.\"\n\n\n \"I get it. Makes us seem better  than we are. They think we know  exactly what we're doing even  though we don't.\"\n\n\n \"If we're lucky they'll think  that.\" Bal looked out of the port at  the planet below. \"It's going to  be cold where I'm going. You too.  Sure we don't want to change  our plans and land in the southern  hemisphere? It's summer  there.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not. The great  powers are in the north. They  are the ones we have to reach to  do the job.\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, but I was thinking of  that holiday you mentioned.  We'll be running straight into it.  That won't help us any.\"\n\n\n \"I know, they don't like their  holidays interrupted. It can't be  helped. We can't wait until it's  over.\"\n\n\n \"I'm aware of that,\" said Bal.  \"Fill me in on that holiday, anything  I ought to know. Probably  religious in origin. That so?\"\n\n\n \"It was religious a long time  ago,\" said Ethaniel. \"I didn't  learn anything exact from radio  and TV. Now it seems to be  chiefly a time for eating, office  parties, and selling merchandise.\"\n\n\n \"I see. It has become a business  holiday.\"\n\n\n \"That's a good description. I  didn't get as much of it as I  ought to have. I was busy studying  the people, and they're hard  to pin down.\"\n\n\n \"I see. I was thinking there  might be some way we could tie  ourselves in with this holiday.  Make it work for us.\"\n\n\n \"If there is I haven't thought  of it.\"\n\n\n \"You ought to know. You're  running this one.\" Bal looked  down at the planet. Clouds were  beginning to form at the twilight  edge. \"I hate to go down  and leave the ship up here with  no one in it.\"\n\n\n \"They can't touch it. No matter  how they develop in the next  hundred years they still won't be  able to get in or damage it in  any way.\"\n\n\n \"It's myself I'm thinking  about. Down there, alone.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be with you. On the other  side of the Earth.\"\n\n\n \"That's not very close. I'd like  it better if there were someone  in the ship to bring it down in a  hurry if things get rough. They  don't think much of each other.  I don't imagine they'll like aliens  any better.\"\n\n\n \"They may be unfriendly,\"  Ethaniel acknowledged. Now he  switched a monitor screen until  he looked at the slope of a mountain.  It was snowing and men  were cutting small green trees in  the snow. \"I've thought of a  trick.\"\n\n\n \"If it saves my neck I'm for  it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't guarantee anything,\"  said Ethaniel. \"This is what I  was thinking of: instead of hiding  the ship against the sun  where there's little chance it will  be seen, we'll make sure that  they do see it. Let's take it  around to the night side of the  planet and light it up.\"\n\n\n \"Say, pretty good,\" said Bal.\n\n\n \"They can't imagine that we'd  light up an unmanned ship,\" said  Ethaniel. \"Even if the thought  should occur to them they'll have  no way of checking it. Also, they  won't be eager to harm us with  our ship shining down on them.\"\n\n\n \"That's thinking,\" said Bal,  moving to the controls. \"I'll move  the ship over where they can see  it best and then I'll light it up.  I'll really light it up.\"\n\n\n \"Don't spare power.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about that.  They'll see it. Everybody on  Earth will see it.\" Later, with the  ship in position, glowing against  the darkness of space, pulsating  with light, Bal said: \"You know,  I feel better about this. We may  pull it off. Lighting the ship may  be just the help we need.\"\n\n\n \"It's not we who need help, but  the people of Earth,\" said Ethaniel.  \"See you in five days.\" With  that he entered a small landing  craft, which left a faintly luminescent  trail as it plunged toward  Earth. As soon as it was  safe to do so, Bal left in another  craft, heading for the other side  of the planet. And the spaceship circled  Earth, unmanned, blazing and  pulsing with light. No star in the  winter skies of the planet below  could equal it in brilliancy. Once  a man-made satellite came near  but it was dim and was lost sight  of by the people below. During  the day the ship was visible as  a bright spot of light. At evening  it seemed to burn through  the sunset colors.\n\n\n And the ship circled on,  bright, shining, seeming to be a  little piece clipped from the center  of a star and brought near  Earth to illuminate it. Never, or  seldom, had Earth seen anything  like it.\n\n\n In five days the two small landing  craft that had left it arched  up from Earth and joined the  orbit of the large ship. The two  small craft slid inside the large  one and doors closed behind  them. In a short time the aliens  met again.\n\n\n \"We did it,\" said Bal exultantly  as he came in. \"I don't know  how we did it and I thought we  were going to fail but at the last  minute they came through.\"\n\n\n Ethaniel smiled. \"I'm tired,\"  he said, rustling.\n\n\n \"Me too, but mostly I'm cold,\"  said Bal, shivering. \"Snow.  Nothing but snow wherever I  went. Miserable climate. And yet  you had me go out walking after  that first day.\"\n\n\n \"From my own experience it  seemed to be a good idea,\" said  Ethaniel. \"If I went out walking  one day I noticed that the next  day the officials were much more  cooperative. If it worked for me  I thought it might help you.\"\n\n\n \"It did. I don't know why, but  it did,\" said Bal. \"Anyway, this  agreement they made isn't the  best but I think it will keep them  from destroying themselves.\"\n\n\n \"It's as much as we can expect,\"  said Ethaniel. \"They may  have small wars after this, but  never the big one. In fifty or a  hundred years we can come back  and see how much they've  learned.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I want to,\" said  Bal. \"Say, what's an angel?\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"When I went out walking  people stopped to look. Some  knelt in the snow and called me  an angel.\"\n\n\n \"Something like that happened  to me,\" said Ethaniel.\n\n\n \"I didn't get it but I didn't let  it upset me,\" said Bal. \"I smiled  at them and went about my business.\"  He shivered again. \"It was  always cold. I walked out, but  sometimes I flew back. I hope  that was all right.\"\n\n\n In the cabin Bal spread his  great wings. Renaissance painters  had never seen his like but  knew exactly how he looked. In  their paintings they had pictured  him innumerable times.\n\n\n \"I don't think it hurt us that  you flew,\" said Ethaniel. \"I did  so myself occasionally.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't know what an  angel is?\"\n\n\n \"No. I didn't have time to find  out. Some creature of their folklore  I suppose. You know, except  for our wings they're very much  like ourselves. Their legends are  bound to resemble ours.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Bal. \"Anyway,  peace on Earth.\" THE END Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Amazing Science Fiction Stories January  1960.

Earth  was so far away that  it wasn't visible. Even the  sun was only a twinkle. But this  vast distance did not mean that  isolation could endure forever.  Instruments within the ship intercepted  radio broadcasts and,  within the hour, early TV signals.  Machines compiled dictionaries  and grammars and began  translating the major languages.  The history of the planet was  tabulated as facts became available.\n\n\n The course of the ship changed  slightly; it was not much out of  the way to swing nearer Earth.  For days the two within the ship  listened and watched with little  comment. They had to decide  soon.\n\n\n \"We've got to make or break,\"  said the first alien.\n\n\n \"You know what I'm in favor  of,\" said the second.\n\n\n \"I can guess,\" said Ethaniel,  who had spoken first. \"The place  is a complete mess. They've never  done anything except fight  each other\u2014and invent better  weapons.\"\n\n\n \"It's not what they've done,\"  said Bal, the second alien. \"It's  what they're going to do, with  that big bomb.\"\n\n\n \"The more reason for stopping,\"  said Ethaniel. \"The big  bomb can destroy them. Without  our help they may do just that.\"\n\n\n \"I may remind you that in two  months twenty-nine days we're  due in Willafours,\" said Bal.  \"Without looking at the charts  I can tell you we still have more  than a hundred light-years to  go.\"\n\n\n \"A week,\" said Ethaniel. \"We  can spare a week and still get  there on time.\"\n\n\n \"A week?\" said Bal. \"To settle  their problems? They've had two  world wars in one generation  and that the third and final one  is coming up you can't help feeling  in everything they do.\"\n\n\n \"It won't take much,\" said  Ethaniel. \"The wrong diplomatic  move, or a trigger-happy soldier  could set it off. And it wouldn't  have to be deliberate. A meteor  shower could pass over and their  clumsy instruments could interpret  it as an all-out enemy  attack.\"\n\n\n \"Too bad,\" said Bal. \"We'll  just have to forget there ever  was such a planet as Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Could you? Forget so many  people?\"\n\n\n \"I'm doing it,\" said Bal. \"Just  give them a little time and they  won't be here to remind me that  I have a conscience.\"\n\n\n \"My memory isn't convenient,\"  said Ethaniel. \"I ask you  to look at them.\" Bal rustled, flicking the screen  intently. \"Very much like ourselves,\"  he said at last. \"A bit  shorter perhaps, and most certainly  incomplete. Except for the  one thing they lack, and that's  quite odd, they seem exactly like  us. Is that what you wanted me  to say?\"\n\n\n \"It is. The fact that they are  an incomplete version of ourselves  touches me. They actually  seem defenseless, though I suppose  they're not.\"\n\n\n \"Tough,\" said Bal. \"Nothing  we can do about it.\"\n\n\n \"There is. We can give them  a week.\"\n\n\n \"In a week we can't negate  their entire history. We can't  begin to undo the effect of the  big bomb.\"\n\n\n \"You can't tell,\" said Ethaniel.  \"We can look things over.\"\n\n\n \"And then what? How much  authority do we have?\"\n\n\n \"Very little,\" conceded Ethaniel.  \"Two minor officials on the  way to Willafours\u2014and we run  directly into a problem no one  knew existed.\"\n\n\n \"And when we get to Willafours  we'll be busy. It will be a  long time before anyone comes  this way again.\"\n\n\n \"A very long time. There's  nothing in this region of space  our people want,\" said Ethaniel.  \"And how long can Earth last?  Ten years? Even ten months?  The tension is building by the  hour.\"\n\n\n \"What can I say?\" said Bal.  \"I suppose we can stop and look  them over. We're not committing  ourselves by looking.\"\n\n\n They went much closer to  Earth, not intending to commit  themselves. For a day they circled  the planet, avoiding radar  detection, which for them was  not difficult, testing, and sampling.  Finally Ethaniel looked up  from the monitor screen. \"Any  conclusions?\"\n\n\n \"What's there to think? It's  worse than I imagined.\"\n\n\n \"In what way?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we knew they had the  big bomb. Atmospheric analysis  showed that as far away as we  were.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\"\n\n\n \"We also knew they could deliver  the big bomb, presumably  by some sort of aircraft.\"\n\n\n \"That was almost a certainty.  They'd have no use for the big  bomb without aircraft.\"\n\n\n \"What's worse is that I now  find they also have missiles,  range one thousand miles and  upward. They either have or are  near a primitive form of space  travel.\"\n\n\n \"Bad,\" said Ethaniel. \"Sitting  there, wondering when it's going  to hit them. Nervousness could  set it off.\"\n\n\n \"It could, and the missiles  make it worse,\" said Bal. \"What  did you find out at your end?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing worthwhile. I was  looking at the people while you  were investigating their weapons.\"\n\n\n \"You must think something.\"\n\n\n \"I wish I knew what to think.  There's so little time,\" Ethaniel  said. \"Language isn't the difficulty.  Our machines translate  their languages easily and I've  taken a cram course in two or  three of them. But that's not  enough, looking at a few plays,  listening to advertisements, music,  and news bulletins. I should  go down and live among them,  read books, talk to scholars, work  with them, play.\"\n\n\n \"You could do that and you'd  really get to know them. But  that takes time\u2014and we don't  have it.\"\n\n\n \"I realize that.\"\n\n\n \"A flat yes or no,\" said Bal.\n\n\n \"No. We can't help them,\" said  Ethaniel. \"There is nothing we  can do for them\u2014but we have to  try.\"\n\n\n \"Sure, I knew it before we  started,\" said Bal. \"It's happened  before.

Some  knelt in the snow and called me  an angel.\"\n\n\n \"Something like that happened  to me,\" said Ethaniel.\n\n\n \"I didn't get it but I didn't let  it upset me,\" said Bal. \"I smiled  at them and went about my business.\"  He shivered again. \"It was  always cold. I walked out, but  sometimes I flew back. I hope  that was all right.\"\n\n\n In the cabin Bal spread his  great wings. Renaissance painters  had never seen his like but  knew exactly how he looked. In  their paintings they had pictured  him innumerable times.\n\n\n \"I don't think it hurt us that  you flew,\" said Ethaniel. \"I did  so myself occasionally.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't know what an  angel is?\"\n\n\n \"No. I didn't have time to find  out. Some creature of their folklore  I suppose. You know, except  for our wings they're very much  like ourselves. Their legends are  bound to resemble ours.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" said Bal. \"Anyway,  peace on Earth.\" THE END Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Amazing Science Fiction Stories January  1960.
