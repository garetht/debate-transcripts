      "background_text": "THE GREAT NEBRASKA SEA By ALLAN DANZIG\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1963.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] It has happened a hundred times in the long history   of Earth\u2014and, sooner or later, will happen again! Everyone\u2014all the geologists, at any rate\u2014had known about the Kiowa  Fault for years. That was before there was anything very interesting  to know about it. The first survey of Colorado traced its course north  and south in the narrow valley of Kiowa Creek about twenty miles east  of Denver; it extended south to the Arkansas River. And that was about  all even the professionals were interested in knowing. There was never  so much as a landslide to bring the Fault to the attention of the  general public.\n\n\n It was still a matter of academic interest when in the late '40s  geologists speculated on the relationship between the Kiowa Fault and  the Conchas Fault farther south, in New Mexico, and which followed the  Pecos as far south as Texas.\n\n\n Nor was there much in the papers a few years later when it was  suggested that the Niobrara Fault (just inside and roughly parallel to  the eastern border of Wyoming) was a northerly extension of the Kiowa.  By the mid sixties it was definitely established that the three Faults  were in fact a single line of fissure in the essential rock, stretching  almost from the Canadian border well south of the New Mexico-Texas line.\n\n\n It is not really surprising that it took so long to figure out the  connection. The population of the states affected was in places as  low as five people per square mile! The land was so dry it seemed  impossible that it could ever be used except for sheep-farming.\n\n\n It strikes us today as ironic that from the late '50s there was grave  concern about the level of the water table throughout the entire area. The even more ironic solution to the problem began in the summer of  1973. It had been a particularly hot and dry August, and the Forestry  Service was keeping an anxious eye out for the fires it knew it could  expect. Dense smoke was reported rising above a virtually uninhabited  area along Black Squirrel Creek, and a plane was sent out for a report.\n\n\n The report was\u2014no fire at all. The rising cloud was not smoke, but  dust. Thousands of cubic feet of dry earth rising lazily on the summer  air. Rock slides, they guessed; certainly no fire. The Forestry Service  had other worries at the moment, and filed the report.\n\n\n But after a week had gone by, the town of Edison, a good twenty miles  away from the slides, was still complaining of the dust. Springs was  going dry, too, apparently from underground disturbances. Not even in  the Rockies could anyone remember a series of rock slides as bad as  this.\n\n\n Newspapers in the mountain states gave it a few inches on the front  page; anything is news in late August. And the geologists became  interested. Seismologists were reporting unusual activity in the area,  tremors too severe to be rock slides. Volcanic activity? Specifically,  a dust volcano? Unusual, they knew, but right on the Kiowa Fault\u2014could  be.\n\n\n Labor Day crowds read the scientific conjectures with late summer  lassitude. Sunday supplements ran four-color artists' conceptions of  the possible volcano. \"Only Active Volcano in U. S.?\" demanded the  headlines, and some papers even left off the question mark.\n\n\n It may seem odd that the simplest explanation was practically not  mentioned. Only Joseph Schwartzberg, head geographer of the Department  of the Interior, wondered if the disturbance might not be a settling  of the Kiowa Fault. His suggestion was mentioned on page nine or ten  of the Monday newspapers (page 27 of the New York Times ). The idea  was not nearly so exciting as a volcano, even a lava-less one, and you  couldn't draw a very dramatic picture of it.\n\n\n To excuse the other geologists, it must be said that the Kiowa Fault  had never acted up before. It never sidestepped, never jiggled,  never, never produced the regular shows of its little sister out in  California, which almost daily bounced San Francisco or Los Angeles, or  some place in between. The dust volcano was on the face of it a more  plausible theory.\n\n\n Still, it was only a theory. It had to be proved. As the tremors grew  bigger, along with the affected area, as several towns including  Edison were shaken to pieces by incredible earthquakes, whole bus- and  plane-loads of geologists set out for Colorado, without even waiting  for their university and government department to approve budgets.\n\n\n They found, of course, that Schwartzberg had been perfectly correct. They found themselves on the scene of what was fast becoming the  most violent and widespread earthquake North America\u2014probably the  world\u2014has ever seen in historic times. To describe it in the simplest  terms, land east of the Fault was settling, and at a precipitous rate.\n\n\n Rock scraped rock with a whining roar. Shuddery as a squeaky piece of  chalk raked across a blackboard, the noise was deafening. The surfaces  of the land east and west of the Fault seemed no longer to have any  relation to each other. To the west, tortured rock reared into cliffs.  East, where sharp reports and muffled wheezes told of continued  buckling and dropping, the earth trembled downward. Atop the new  cliffs, which seemed to grow by sudden inches from heaving rubble, dry  earth fissured and trembled, sliding acres at a time to fall, smoking,  into the bucking, heaving bottom of the depression.\n\n\n There the devastation was even more thorough, if less spectacular.  Dry earth churned like mud, and rock shards weighing tons bumped and  rolled about like pebbles as they shivered and cracked into pebbles  themselves. \"It looks like sand dancing in a child's sieve,\" said the  normally impassive Schwartzberg in a nationwide broadcast from the  scene of disaster. \"No one here has ever seen anything like it.\" And  the landslip was growing, north and south along the Fault.\n\n\n \"Get out while you can,\" Schwartzberg urged the population of the  affected area. \"When it's over you can come back and pick up the  pieces.\" But the band of scientists who had rallied to his leadership  privately wondered if there would be any pieces.\n\n\n The Arkansas River, at Avondale and North Avondale, was sluggishly  backing north into the deepening trough. At the rate things were going,  there might be a new lake the entire length of El Paso and Pueblo  Counties. And, warned Schwartzberg, this might only be the beginning.\n\n\n By 16 September the landslip had crept down the Huerfano River past  Cedarwood. Avondale, North Avondale and Boone had totally disappeared.  Land west of the Fault was holding firm, though Denver had recorded  several small tremors; everywhere east of the Fault, to almost twenty  miles away, the now-familiar lurch and steady fall had already sent  several thousand Coloradans scurrying for safety.\n\n\n All mountain climbing was prohibited on the Eastern Slope because of  the danger of rock slides from minor quakes. The geologists went home  to wait.\n\n\n There wasn't much to wait for. The news got worse and worse. The Platte  River, now, was creating a vast mud puddle where the town of Orchard  had been. Just below Masters, Colorado, the river leaped 70-foot cliffs  to add to the heaving chaos below. And the cliffs were higher every day  as the land beneath them groaned downward in mile-square gulps.\n\n\n As the Fault moved north and south, new areas quivered into unwelcome  life. Fields and whole mountainsides moved with deceptive sloth down,  down. They danced \"like sand in a sieve\"; dry, they boiled into rubble.  Telephone lines, railroad tracks, roads snapped and simply disappeared.  Virtually all east-west land communication was suspended and the  President declared a national emergency. By 23 September the Fault was active well into Wyoming on the north,  and rapidly approaching the border of New Mexico to the south.  Trinchera and Branson were totally evacuated, but even so the over-all  death toll had risen above 1,000.\n\n\n Away to the east the situation was quiet but even more ominous.  Tremendous fissures opened up perpendicular to the Fault, and a general  subsidence of the land was noticeable well into Kansas and Nebraska.  The western borders of these states, and soon of the Dakotas and  Oklahoma as well, were slowly sinking.\n\n\n On the actual scene of the disaster (or the scenes ; it is impossible  to speak of anything this size in the singular) there was a horrifying  confusion. Prairie and hill cracked open under intolerable strains as  the land shuddered downward in gasps and leaps. Springs burst to the  surface in hot geysers and explosions of steam.\n\n\n The downtown section of North Platte, Nebraska, dropped eight feet,  just like that, on the afternoon of 4 October. \"We must remain calm,\"  declared the Governor of Nebraska. \"We must sit this thing out. Be  assured that everything possible is being done.\" But what could be  done, with his state dropping straight down at a mean rate of a foot a  day?\n\n\n The Fault nicked off the south-east corner of Montana. It worked its  way north along the Little Missouri. South, it ripped past Roswell, New  Mexico, and tore down the Pecos toward Texas. All the upper reaches of  the Missouri were standing puddles by now, and the Red River west of  Paris, Texas, had begun to run backward.\n\n\n Soon the Missouri began slowly slipping away westward over the slowly  churning land. Abandoning its bed, the river spread uncertainly across  farmland and prairie, becoming a sea of mud beneath the sharp new  cliffs which rose in rending line, ever taller as the land continued to  sink, almost from Canada to the Mexican border. There were virtually no  floods, in the usual sense. The water moved too slowly, spread itself  with no real direction or force. But the vast sheets of sluggish water  and jelly-like mud formed death-traps for the countless refugees now  streaming east.\n\n\n Perhaps the North Platte disaster had been more than anyone could take.  193 people had died in that one cave-in. Certainly by 7 October it had  to be officially admitted that there was an exodus of epic proportion.  Nearly two million people were on the move, and the U. S. was faced  with a gigantic wave of refugees. Rails, roads and air-lanes were  jammed with terrified hordes who had left everything behind to crowd  eastward.\n\n\n All through October hollow-eyed motorists flocked into Tulsa, Topeka,  Omaha, Sioux Falls and Fargo. St. Louis was made distributing center  for emergency squads which flew everywhere with milk for babies and  dog food for evacuating pets. Gasoline trucks boomed west to meet the  demand for gas, but once inside the \"zone of terror,\" as the newspapers  now called it, they found their route blocked by eastbound cars on the  wrong side of the road. Shops left by their fleeing owners were looted  by refugees from further west; an American Airlines plane was wrecked  by a mob of would-be passengers in Bismarck, North Dakota. Federal and  State troops were called out, but moving two million people was not to  be done in an orderly way.\n\n\n And still the landslip grew larger. The new cliffs gleamed in the  autumn sunshine, growing higher as the land beneath them continued its  inexorable descent.\n\n\n On 21 October, at Lubbock, Texas, there was a noise variously described  as a hollow roar, a shriek and a deep musical vibration like a church  bell. It was simply the tortured rock of the substrata giving way. The  second phase of the national disaster was beginning. The noise traveled due east at better than 85 miles per hour. In its  wake the earth to the north \"just seemed to collapse on itself like  a punctured balloon,\" read one newspaper report. \"Like a cake that's  failed,\" said a Texarkana housewife who fortunately lived a block south of Thayer Street, where the fissure raced through. There  was a sigh and a great cloud of dust, and Oklahoma subsided at the  astounding rate of about six feet per hour.\n\n\n At Biloxi, on the Gulf, there had been uneasy shufflings under foot all  day. \"Not tremors, exactly,\" said the captain of a fishing boat which  was somehow to ride out the coming flood, \"but like as if the land  wanted to be somewhere else.\"\n\n\n Everyone in doomed Biloxi would have done well to have been somewhere  else that evening. At approximately 8:30 p.m. the town shuddered,  seemed to rise a little like the edge of a hall carpet caught in a  draft, and sank. So did the entire Mississippi and Alabama coast, at  about the same moment. The tidal wave which was to gouge the center  from the U. S. marched on the land. From the north shore of Lake Ponchartrain to the Appalachicola River  in Florida, the Gulf coast simply disappeared. Gulfport, Biloxi,  Mobile, Pensacola, Panama City: 200 miles of shoreline vanished, with  over two and a half million people. An hour later a wall of water  had swept over every town from Dothan, Alabama, to Bogalusa on the  Louisiana-Mississippi border.\n\n\n \"We must keep panic from our minds,\" said the Governor of Alabama in a  radio message delivered from a hastily arranged all-station hookup. \"We  of the gallant southland have faced and withstood invasion before.\"  Then, as ominous creakings and groanings of the earth announced the  approach of the tidal wave, he flew out of Montgomery half an hour  before the town disappeared forever.\n\n\n One head of the wave plunged north, eventually to spend itself in  the hills south of Birmingham. The main sweep followed the lowest  land. Reaching west, it swallowed Vicksburg and nicked the corner of  Louisiana. The whole of East Carroll Parish was scoured from the map.\n\n\n The Mississippi River now ended at about Eudora, Arkansas, and minute  by minute the advancing flood bit away miles of river bed, swelling  north. Chicot, Jennie, Lake Village, Arkansas City, Snow Lake, Elaine,  Helena and Memphis felt the tremors. The tormented city shuddered  through the night. The earth continued its descent, eventually tipping  2-1/2 degrees down to the west. The \"Memphis Tilt\" is today one of  the unique and charming characteristics of the gracious Old Town, but  during the night of panic Memphis residents were sure they were doomed. South and west the waters carved deeply into Arkansas and Oklahoma.  By morning it was plain that all of Arkansas was going under. Waves  advanced on Little Rock at almost 100 miles an hour, new crests  forming, overtopping the wave's leading edge as towns, hills and the  thirst of the soil temporarily broke the furious charge.\n\n\n Washington announced the official hope that the Ozarks would stop the  wild gallop of the unleashed Gulf, for in northwest Arkansas the land  rose to over 2,000 feet. But nothing could save Oklahoma. By noon the  water reached clutching fingers around Mt. Scott and Elk Mountain,  deluging Hobart and almost all of Greer County.\n\n\n Despite hopeful announcements that the wave was slowing, had virtually  stopped after inundating Oklahoma City, was being swallowed up in the  desert near Amarillo, the wall of water continued its advance. For the  land was still sinking, and the floods were constantly replenished from  the Gulf. Schwartzberg and his geologists advised the utmost haste in  evacuating the entire area between Colorado and Missouri, from Texas to  North Dakota.\n\n\n Lubbock, Texas, went under. On a curling reflex the tidal wave blotted  out Sweetwater and Big Spring. The Texas panhandle disappeared in one  great swirl.\n\n\n Whirlpools opened. A great welter of smashed wood and human debris was  sucked under, vomited up and pounded to pieces. Gulf-water crashed on  the cliffs of New Mexico and fell back on itself in foam. Would-be  rescuers on the cliffs along what had been the west bank of the Pecos  River afterwards recalled the hiss and scream like tearing silk as  the water broke furiously on the newly exposed rock. It was the most  terrible sound they had ever heard.\n\n\n \"We couldn't hear any shouts, of course, not that far away and with all  the noise,\" said Dan Weaver, Mayor of Carlsbad. \"But we knew there  were people down there. When the water hit the cliffs, it was like a  collision between two solid bodies. We couldn't see for over an hour,  because of the spray.\" Salt spray. The ocean had come to New Mexico. The cliffs proved to be the only effective barrier against the westward  march of the water, which turned north, gouging out lumps of rock and  tumbling down blocks of earth onto its own back. In places scoops of  granite came out like ice cream. The present fishing town of Rockport,  Colorado, is built on a harbor created in such a way.\n\n\n The water had found its farthest westering. But still it poured north  along the line of the original Fault. Irresistible fingers closed on  Sterling, Colorado, on Sidney, Nebraska, on Hot Springs, South Dakota.  The entire tier of states settled, from south to north, down to its  eventual place of stability one thousand feet below the level of the  new sea.\n\n\n Memphis was by now a seaport. The Ozarks, islands in a mad sea, formed  precarious havens for half-drowned humanity. Waves bit off a corner of  Missouri, flung themselves on Wichita. Topeka, Lawrence and Belleville  were the last Kansas towns to disappear. The Governor of Kansas went  down with his State.\n\n\n Daniel Bernd of Lincoln, Nebraska, was washed up half-drowned in a cove  of the Wyoming cliffs, having been sucked from one end of vanished  Nebraska to the other. Similar hair-breadth escapes were recounted on  radio and television.\n\n\n Virtually the only people saved out of the entire population of Pierre,  South Dakota were the six members of the Creeth family. Plucky Timothy  Creeth carried and dragged his aged parents to the loft of their barn  on the outskirts of town. His brother Geoffrey brought along the  younger children and what provisions they could find\u2014\"Mostly a ham  and about half a ton of vanilla cookies,\" he explained to his eventual  rescuers. The barn, luckily collapsing in the vibrations as the waves  bore down on them, became an ark in which they rode out the disaster.\n\n\n \"We must of played cards for four days straight,\" recalled genial  Mrs. Creeth when she afterwards appeared on a popular television  spectacular. Her rural good-humor undamaged by an ordeal few women can  ever have been called on to face, she added, \"We sure wondered why  flushes never came out right. Jimanettly, we'd left the king of hearts  behind, in the rush!\"\n\n\n But such lightheartedness and such happy endings were by no means  typical. The world could only watch aghast as the water raced north  under the shadow of the cliffs which occasionally crumbled, roaring,  into the roaring waves. Day by day the relentless rush swallowed what  had been dusty farmland, cities and towns.\n\n\n Some people were saved by the helicopters which flew mercy missions  just ahead of the advancing waters. Some found safety in the peaks of  western Nebraska and the Dakotas. But when the waters came to rest  along what is roughly the present shoreline of our inland sea, it was  estimated that over fourteen million people had lost their lives.\n\n\n No one could even estimate the damage to property; almost the entirety  of eight states, and portions of twelve others, had simply vanished  from the heart of the North American continent forever. It was in such a cataclysmic birth that the now-peaceful Nebraska Sea  came to America.\n\n\n Today, nearly one hundred years after the unprecedented\u2014and happily  unrepeated\u2014disaster, it is hard to remember the terror and despair of  those weeks in October and November, 1973. It is inconceivable to think  of the United States without its beautiful and economically essential  curve of interior ocean. Two-thirds as long as the Mediterranean,  it graduates from the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico through the  equally blue waves of the Mississippi Bight, becoming cooler and  greener north and west of the pleasant fishing isles of the Ozark  Archipelago, finally shading into the gray-green chop of the Gulf of  Dakota.\n\n\n What would the United States have become without the 5600-mile  coastline of our inland sea? It is only within the last twenty years  that any but the topmost layer of water has cleared sufficiently  to permit a really extensive fishing industry. Mud still held in  suspension by the restless waves will not precipitate fully even in our  lifetimes. Even so, the commercial fisheries of Missouri and Wyoming  contribute no small part to the nation's economy. Who can imagine what the middle west must have been like before the  amelioration of climate brought about by the proximity of a warm sea?  The now-temperate state of Minnesota (to say nothing of the submerged  Dakotas) must have been Siberian. From contemporary accounts Missouri,  our second California, was unbelievably muggy, almost uninhabitable  during the summer months. Our climate today, from Ohio and North  Carolina to the rich fields of New Mexico and the orchards of Montana,  is directly ameliorated by the marine heart of the continent. Who today could imagine the United States without the majestic  sea-cliffs in stately parade from New Mexico to Montana? The beaches  of Wyoming, the American Riviera, where fruit trees grow almost to the  water's edge? Or incredible Colorado, where the morning skier is the  afternoon bather, thanks to the monorail connecting the highest peaks  with the glistening white beaches? Of course there have been losses to balance slightly these strong  gains. The Mississippi was, before 1973, one of the great rivers of  the world. Taken together with its main tributary, the Missouri, it  vied favorably with such giant systems as the Amazon and the Ganges.  Now, ending as it does at Memphis and drawing its water chiefly from  the Appalachian Mountains, it is only a slight remnant of what it was.  And though the Nebraska Sea today carries many times the tonnage of  shipping in its ceaseless traffic, we have lost the old romance of  river shipping. We may only guess what it was like when we look upon  the Ohio and the truncated Mississippi.\n\n\n And transcontinental shipping is somewhat more difficult, with trucks  and the freight-railroads obliged to take the sea-ferries across the  Nebraska Sea. We shall never know what the United States was like with  its numerous coast-to-coast highways busy with trucks and private  cars. Still, the ferry ride is certainly a welcome break after days of  driving, and for those who wish a glimpse of what it must have been  like, there is always the Cross-Canada Throughway and the magnificent  U. S. Highway 73 looping north through Minnesota and passing through  the giant port of Alexis, North Dakota, shipping center for the wheat  of Manitoba and crossroad of a nation. The political situation has long been a thorny problem. Only tattered  remnants of the eight submerged states remained after the flood, but  none of them wanted to surrender its autonomy. The tiny fringe of  Kansas seemed, for a time, ready to merge with contiguous Missouri,  but following the lead of the Arkansas Forever faction, the remaining  population decided to retain political integrity. This has resulted  in the continuing anomaly of the seven \"fringe States\" represented  in Congress by the usual two Senators each, though the largest of  them is barely the size of Connecticut and all are economically  indistinguishable from their neighboring states.\n\n\n Fortunately it was decided some years ago that Oklahoma, only one of  the eight to have completely disappeared, could not in any sense be  considered to have a continuing political existence. So, though there  are still families who proudly call themselves Oklahomans, and the  Oklahoma Oil Company continues to pump oil from its submerged real  estate, the state has in fact disappeared from the American political  scene.\n\n\n But this is by now no more than a petty annoyance, to raise a smile  when the talk gets around to the question of State's Rights. Not even  the tremendous price the country paid for its new sea\u2014fourteen million  dead, untold property destroyed\u2014really offsets the asset we enjoy  today. The heart of the continent, now open to the shipping of the  world, was once dry and land-locked, cut off from the bustle of trade  and the ferment of world culture.\n\n\n It would indeed seem odd to an American of the '50s or '60s of the last  century to imagine sailors from the merchant fleets of every nation  walking the streets of Denver, fresh ashore at Newport, only fifteen  miles away. Or to imagine Lincoln, Fargo, Kansas City and Dallas as  world ports and great manufacturing centers. Utterly beyond their ken  would be Roswell, New Mexico; Benton, Wyoming; Westport, Missouri,  and the other new ports of over a million inhabitants each which have  developed on the new harbors of the inland sea.\n\n\n Unimaginable too would have been the general growth of population  in the states surrounding the new sea. As the water tables rose and  manufacturing and trade moved in to take advantage of the just-created  axis of world communication, a population explosion was touched off of  which we are only now seeing the diminution. This new westering is to  be ranked with the first surge of pioneers which created the American  west. But what a difference! Vacation paradises bloom, a new fishing  industry thrives; her water road is America's main artery of trade, and  fleets of all the world sail ... where once the prairie schooner made  its laborious and dusty way west!

Everyone\u2014all the geologists, at any rate\u2014had known about the Kiowa  Fault for years. That was before there was anything very interesting  to know about it. The first survey of Colorado traced its course north  and south in the narrow valley of Kiowa Creek about twenty miles east  of Denver; it extended south to the Arkansas River. And that was about  all even the professionals were interested in knowing. There was never  so much as a landslide to bring the Fault to the attention of the  general public.\n\n\n It was still a matter of academic interest when in the late '40s  geologists speculated on the relationship between the Kiowa Fault and  the Conchas Fault farther south, in New Mexico, and which followed the  Pecos as far south as Texas.\n\n\n Nor was there much in the papers a few years later when it was  suggested that the Niobrara Fault (just inside and roughly parallel to  the eastern border of Wyoming) was a northerly extension of the Kiowa.  By the mid sixties it was definitely established that the three Faults  were in fact a single line of fissure in the essential rock, stretching  almost from the Canadian border well south of the New Mexico-Texas line.\n\n\n It is not really surprising that it took so long to figure out the  connection. The population of the states affected was in places as  low as five people per square mile! The land was so dry it seemed  impossible that it could ever be used except for sheep-farming.\n\n\n It strikes us today as ironic that from the late '50s there was grave  concern about the level of the water table throughout the entire area. The even more ironic solution to the problem began in the summer of  1973. It had been a particularly hot and dry August, and the Forestry  Service was keeping an anxious eye out for the fires it knew it could  expect. Dense smoke was reported rising above a virtually uninhabited  area along Black Squirrel Creek, and a plane was sent out for a report.\n\n\n The report was\u2014no fire at all. The rising cloud was not smoke, but  dust. Thousands of cubic feet of dry earth rising lazily on the summer  air. Rock slides, they guessed; certainly no fire. The Forestry Service  had other worries at the moment, and filed the report.\n\n\n But after a week had gone by, the town of Edison, a good twenty miles  away from the slides, was still complaining of the dust. Springs was  going dry, too, apparently from underground disturbances. Not even in  the Rockies could anyone remember a series of rock slides as bad as  this.\n\n\n Newspapers in the mountain states gave it a few inches on the front  page; anything is news in late August. And the geologists became  interested. Seismologists were reporting unusual activity in the area,  tremors too severe to be rock slides. Volcanic activity? Specifically,  a dust volcano? Unusual, they knew, but right on the Kiowa Fault\u2014could  be.\n\n\n Labor Day crowds read the scientific conjectures with late summer  lassitude. Sunday supplements ran four-color artists' conceptions of  the possible volcano. \"Only Active Volcano in U. S.?\" demanded the  headlines, and some papers even left off the question mark.\n\n\n It may seem odd that the simplest explanation was practically not  mentioned. Only Joseph Schwartzberg, head geographer of the Department  of the Interior, wondered if the disturbance might not be a settling  of the Kiowa Fault. His suggestion was mentioned on page nine or ten  of the Monday newspapers (page 27 of the New York Times ). The idea  was not nearly so exciting as a volcano, even a lava-less one, and you  couldn't draw a very dramatic picture of it.\n\n\n To excuse the other geologists, it must be said that the Kiowa Fault  had never acted up before. It never sidestepped, never jiggled,  never, never produced the regular shows of its little sister out in  California, which almost daily bounced San Francisco or Los Angeles, or  some place in between. The dust volcano was on the face of it a more  plausible theory.\n\n\n Still, it was only a theory. It had to be proved. As the tremors grew  bigger, along with the affected area, as several towns including  Edison were shaken to pieces by incredible earthquakes, whole bus- and  plane-loads of geologists set out for Colorado, without even waiting  for their university and government department to approve budgets.\n\n\n They found, of course, that Schwartzberg had been perfectly correct. They found themselves on the scene of what was fast becoming the  most violent and widespread earthquake North America\u2014probably the  world\u2014has ever seen in historic times. To describe it in the simplest  terms, land east of the Fault was settling, and at a precipitous rate.\n\n\n Rock scraped rock with a whining roar. Shuddery as a squeaky piece of  chalk raked across a blackboard, the noise was deafening. The surfaces  of the land east and west of the Fault seemed no longer to have any  relation to each other. To the west, tortured rock reared into cliffs.  East, where sharp reports and muffled wheezes told of continued  buckling and dropping, the earth trembled downward. Atop the new  cliffs, which seemed to grow by sudden inches from heaving rubble, dry  earth fissured and trembled, sliding acres at a time to fall, smoking,  into the bucking, heaving bottom of the depression.\n\n\n There the devastation was even more thorough, if less spectacular.  Dry earth churned like mud, and rock shards weighing tons bumped and  rolled about like pebbles as they shivered and cracked into pebbles  themselves. \"It looks like sand dancing in a child's sieve,\" said the  normally impassive Schwartzberg in a nationwide broadcast from the  scene of disaster. \"No one here has ever seen anything like it.\" And  the landslip was growing, north and south along the Fault.\n\n\n \"Get out while you can,\" Schwartzberg urged the population of the  affected area. \"When it's over you can come back and pick up the  pieces.\" But the band of scientists who had rallied to his leadership  privately wondered if there would be any pieces.\n\n\n The Arkansas River, at Avondale and North Avondale, was sluggishly  backing north into the deepening trough. At the rate things were going,  there might be a new lake the entire length of El Paso and Pueblo  Counties. And, warned Schwartzberg, this might only be the beginning.\n\n\n By 16 September the landslip had crept down the Huerfano River past  Cedarwood. Avondale, North Avondale and Boone had totally disappeared.  Land west of the Fault was holding firm, though Denver had recorded  several small tremors; everywhere east of the Fault, to almost twenty  miles away, the now-familiar lurch and steady fall had already sent  several thousand Coloradans scurrying for safety.\n\n\n All mountain climbing was prohibited on the Eastern Slope because of  the danger of rock slides from minor quakes. The geologists went home  to wait.\n\n\n There wasn't much to wait for. The news got worse and worse. The Platte  River, now, was creating a vast mud puddle where the town of Orchard  had been. Just below Masters, Colorado, the river leaped 70-foot cliffs  to add to the heaving chaos below. And the cliffs were higher every day  as the land beneath them groaned downward in mile-square gulps.\n\n\n As the Fault moved north and south, new areas quivered into unwelcome  life. Fields and whole mountainsides moved with deceptive sloth down,  down. They danced \"like sand in a sieve\"; dry, they boiled into rubble.  Telephone lines, railroad tracks, roads snapped and simply disappeared.  Virtually all east-west land communication was suspended and the  President declared a national emergency. By 23 September the Fault was active well into Wyoming on the north,  and rapidly approaching the border of New Mexico to the south.  Trinchera and Branson were totally evacuated, but even so the over-all  death toll had risen above 1,000.\n\n\n Away to the east the situation was quiet but even more ominous.  Tremendous fissures opened up perpendicular to the Fault, and a general  subsidence of the land was noticeable well into Kansas and Nebraska.  The western borders of these states, and soon of the Dakotas and  Oklahoma as well, were slowly sinking.\n\n\n On the actual scene of the disaster (or the scenes ; it is impossible  to speak of anything this size in the singular) there was a horrifying  confusion. Prairie and hill cracked open under intolerable strains as  the land shuddered downward in gasps and leaps. Springs burst to the  surface in hot geysers and explosions of steam.\n\n\n The downtown section of North Platte, Nebraska, dropped eight feet,  just like that, on the afternoon of 4 October. \"We must remain calm,\"  declared the Governor of Nebraska. \"We must sit this thing out. Be  assured that everything possible is being done.\" But what could be  done, with his state dropping straight down at a mean rate of a foot a  day?\n\n\n The Fault nicked off the south-east corner of Montana. It worked its  way north along the Little Missouri. South, it ripped past Roswell, New  Mexico, and tore down the Pecos toward Texas. All the upper reaches of  the Missouri were standing puddles by now, and the Red River west of  Paris, Texas, had begun to run backward.\n\n\n Soon the Missouri began slowly slipping away westward over the slowly  churning land. Abandoning its bed, the river spread uncertainly across  farmland and prairie, becoming a sea of mud beneath the sharp new  cliffs which rose in rending line, ever taller as the land continued to  sink, almost from Canada to the Mexican border. There were virtually no  floods, in the usual sense. The water moved too slowly, spread itself  with no real direction or force. But the vast sheets of sluggish water  and jelly-like mud formed death-traps for the countless refugees now  streaming east.\n\n\n Perhaps the North Platte disaster had been more than anyone could take.  193 people had died in that one cave-in. Certainly by 7 October it had  to be officially admitted that there was an exodus of epic proportion.  Nearly two million people were on the move, and the U. S. was faced  with a gigantic wave of refugees. Rails, roads and air-lanes were  jammed with terrified hordes who had left everything behind to crowd  eastward.\n\n\n All through October hollow-eyed motorists flocked into Tulsa, Topeka,  Omaha, Sioux Falls and Fargo. St. Louis was made distributing center  for emergency squads which flew everywhere with milk for babies and  dog food for evacuating pets. Gasoline trucks boomed west to meet the  demand for gas, but once inside the \"zone of terror,\" as the newspapers  now called it, they found their route blocked by eastbound cars on the  wrong side of the road. Shops left by their fleeing owners were looted  by refugees from further west; an American Airlines plane was wrecked  by a mob of would-be passengers in Bismarck, North Dakota. Federal and  State troops were called out, but moving two million people was not to  be done in an orderly way.\n\n\n And still the landslip grew larger. The new cliffs gleamed in the  autumn sunshine, growing higher as the land beneath them continued its  inexorable descent.\n\n\n On 21 October, at Lubbock, Texas, there was a noise variously described  as a hollow roar, a shriek and a deep musical vibration like a church  bell. It was simply the tortured rock of the substrata giving way. The  second phase of the national disaster was beginning. The noise traveled due east at better than 85 miles per hour. In its  wake the earth to the north \"just seemed to collapse on itself like  a punctured balloon,\" read one newspaper report. \"Like a cake that's  failed,\" said a Texarkana housewife who fortunately lived a block south of Thayer Street, where the fissure raced through. There  was a sigh and a great cloud of dust, and Oklahoma subsided at the  astounding rate of about six feet per hour.\n\n\n At Biloxi, on the Gulf, there had been uneasy shufflings under foot all  day. \"Not tremors, exactly,\" said the captain of a fishing boat which  was somehow to ride out the coming flood, \"but like as if the land  wanted to be somewhere else.\"\n\n\n Everyone in doomed Biloxi would have done well to have been somewhere  else that evening. At approximately 8:30 p.m. the town shuddered,  seemed to rise a little like the edge of a hall carpet caught in a  draft, and sank. So did the entire Mississippi and Alabama coast, at  about the same moment. The tidal wave which was to gouge the center  from the U. S. marched on the land. From the north shore of Lake Ponchartrain to the Appalachicola River  in Florida, the Gulf coast simply disappeared. Gulfport, Biloxi,  Mobile, Pensacola, Panama City: 200 miles of shoreline vanished, with  over two and a half million people. An hour later a wall of water  had swept over every town from Dothan, Alabama, to Bogalusa on the  Louisiana-Mississippi border.\n\n\n \"We must keep panic from our minds,\" said the Governor of Alabama in a  radio message delivered from a hastily arranged all-station hookup. \"We  of the gallant southland have faced and withstood invasion before.\"  Then, as ominous creakings and groanings of the earth announced the  approach of the tidal wave, he flew out of Montgomery half an hour  before the town disappeared forever.\n\n\n One head of the wave plunged north, eventually to spend itself in  the hills south of Birmingham. The main sweep followed the lowest  land. Reaching west, it swallowed Vicksburg and nicked the corner of  Louisiana. The whole of East Carroll Parish was scoured from the map.\n\n\n The Mississippi River now ended at about Eudora, Arkansas, and minute  by minute the advancing flood bit away miles of river bed, swelling  north. Chicot, Jennie, Lake Village, Arkansas City, Snow Lake, Elaine,  Helena and Memphis felt the tremors. The tormented city shuddered  through the night. The earth continued its descent, eventually tipping  2-1/2 degrees down to the west. The \"Memphis Tilt\" is today one of  the unique and charming characteristics of the gracious Old Town, but  during the night of panic Memphis residents were sure they were doomed. South and west the waters carved deeply into Arkansas and Oklahoma.  By morning it was plain that all of Arkansas was going under. Waves  advanced on Little Rock at almost 100 miles an hour, new crests  forming, overtopping the wave's leading edge as towns, hills and the  thirst of the soil temporarily broke the furious charge.\n\n\n Washington announced the official hope that the Ozarks would stop the  wild gallop of the unleashed Gulf, for in northwest Arkansas the land  rose to over 2,000 feet. But nothing could save Oklahoma. By noon the  water reached clutching fingers around Mt. Scott and Elk Mountain,  deluging Hobart and almost all of Greer County.\n\n\n Despite hopeful announcements that the wave was slowing, had virtually  stopped after inundating Oklahoma City, was being swallowed up in the  desert near Amarillo, the wall of water continued its advance. For the  land was still sinking, and the floods were constantly replenished from  the Gulf. Schwartzberg and his geologists advised the utmost haste in  evacuating the entire area between Colorado and Missouri, from Texas to  North Dakota.\n\n\n Lubbock, Texas, went under. On a curling reflex the tidal wave blotted  out Sweetwater and Big Spring. The Texas panhandle disappeared in one  great swirl.\n\n\n Whirlpools opened. A great welter of smashed wood and human debris was  sucked under, vomited up and pounded to pieces. Gulf-water crashed on  the cliffs of New Mexico and fell back on itself in foam. Would-be  rescuers on the cliffs along what had been the west bank of the Pecos  River afterwards recalled the hiss and scream like tearing silk as  the water broke furiously on the newly exposed rock. It was the most  terrible sound they had ever heard.\n\n\n \"We couldn't hear any shouts, of course, not that far away and with all  the noise,\" said Dan Weaver, Mayor of Carlsbad. \"But we knew there  were people down there. When the water hit the cliffs, it was like a  collision between two solid bodies. We couldn't see for over an hour,  because of the spray.\" Salt spray. The ocean had come to New Mexico. The cliffs proved to be the only effective barrier against the westward  march of the water, which turned north, gouging out lumps of rock and  tumbling down blocks of earth onto its own back. In places scoops of  granite came out like ice cream. The present fishing town of Rockport,  Colorado, is built on a harbor created in such a way.\n\n\n The water had found its farthest westering. But still it poured north  along the line of the original Fault. Irresistible fingers closed on  Sterling, Colorado, on Sidney, Nebraska, on Hot Springs, South Dakota.  The entire tier of states settled, from south to north, down to its  eventual place of stability one thousand feet below the level of the  new sea.\n\n\n Memphis was by now a seaport. The Ozarks, islands in a mad sea, formed  precarious havens for half-drowned humanity. Waves bit off a corner of  Missouri, flung themselves on Wichita. Topeka, Lawrence and Belleville  were the last Kansas towns to disappear. The Governor of Kansas went  down with his State.\n\n\n Daniel Bernd of Lincoln, Nebraska, was washed up half-drowned in a cove  of the Wyoming cliffs, having been sucked from one end of vanished  Nebraska to the other. Similar hair-breadth escapes were recounted on  radio and television.\n\n\n Virtually the only people saved out of the entire population of Pierre,  South Dakota were the six members of the Creeth family. Plucky Timothy  Creeth carried and dragged his aged parents to the loft of their barn  on the outskirts of town. His brother Geoffrey brought along the  younger children and what provisions they could find\u2014\"Mostly a ham  and about half a ton of vanilla cookies,\" he explained to his eventual  rescuers. The barn, luckily collapsing in the vibrations as the waves  bore down on them, became an ark in which they rode out the disaster.\n\n\n \"We must of played cards for four days straight,\" recalled genial  Mrs. Creeth when she afterwards appeared on a popular television  spectacular. Her rural good-humor undamaged by an ordeal few women can  ever have been called on to face, she added, \"We sure wondered why  flushes never came out right. Jimanettly, we'd left the king of hearts  behind, in the rush!\"\n\n\n But such lightheartedness and such happy endings were by no means  typical. The world could only watch aghast as the water raced north  under the shadow of the cliffs which occasionally crumbled, roaring,  into the roaring waves. Day by day the relentless rush swallowed what  had been dusty farmland, cities and towns.\n\n\n Some people were saved by the helicopters which flew mercy missions  just ahead of the advancing waters. Some found safety in the peaks of  western Nebraska and the Dakotas. But when the waters came to rest  along what is roughly the present shoreline of our inland sea, it was  estimated that over fourteen million people had lost their lives.\n\n\n No one could even estimate the damage to property; almost the entirety  of eight states, and portions of twelve others, had simply vanished  from the heart of the North American continent forever. It was in such a cataclysmic birth that the now-peaceful Nebraska Sea  came to America.\n\n\n Today, nearly one hundred years after the unprecedented\u2014and happily  unrepeated\u2014disaster, it is hard to remember the terror and despair of  those weeks in October and November, 1973. It is inconceivable to think  of the United States without its beautiful and economically essential  curve of interior ocean. Two-thirds as long as the Mediterranean,  it graduates from the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico through the  equally blue waves of the Mississippi Bight, becoming cooler and  greener north and west of the pleasant fishing isles of the Ozark  Archipelago, finally shading into the gray-green chop of the Gulf of  Dakota.\n\n\n What would the United States have become without the 5600-mile  coastline of our inland sea? It is only within the last twenty years  that any but the topmost layer of water has cleared sufficiently  to permit a really extensive fishing industry. Mud still held in  suspension by the restless waves will not precipitate fully even in our  lifetimes. Even so, the commercial fisheries of Missouri and Wyoming  contribute no small part to the nation's economy. Who can imagine what the middle west must have been like before the  amelioration of climate brought about by the proximity of a warm sea?  The now-temperate state of Minnesota (to say nothing of the submerged  Dakotas) must have been Siberian. From contemporary accounts Missouri,  our second California, was unbelievably muggy, almost uninhabitable  during the summer months. Our climate today, from Ohio and North  Carolina to the rich fields of New Mexico and the orchards of Montana,  is directly ameliorated by the marine heart of the continent. Who today could imagine the United States without the majestic  sea-cliffs in stately parade from New Mexico to Montana? The beaches  of Wyoming, the American Riviera, where fruit trees grow almost to the  water's edge? Or incredible Colorado, where the morning skier is the  afternoon bather, thanks to the monorail connecting the highest peaks  with the glistening white beaches? Of course there have been losses to balance slightly these strong  gains. The Mississippi was, before 1973, one of the great rivers of  the world. Taken together with its main tributary, the Missouri, it  vied favorably with such giant systems as the Amazon and the Ganges.  Now, ending as it does at Memphis and drawing its water chiefly from  the Appalachian Mountains, it is only a slight remnant of what it was.  And though the Nebraska Sea today carries many times the tonnage of  shipping in its ceaseless traffic, we have lost the old romance of  river shipping. We may only guess what it was like when we look upon  the Ohio and the truncated Mississippi.\n\n\n And transcontinental shipping is somewhat more difficult, with trucks  and the freight-railroads obliged to take the sea-ferries across the  Nebraska Sea. We shall never know what the United States was like with  its numerous coast-to-coast highways busy with trucks and private  cars. Still, the ferry ride is certainly a welcome break after days of  driving, and for those who wish a glimpse of what it must have been  like, there is always the Cross-Canada Throughway and the magnificent  U. S. Highway 73 looping north through Minnesota and passing through  the giant port of Alexis, North Dakota, shipping center for the wheat  of Manitoba and crossroad of a nation. The political situation has long been a thorny problem. Only tattered  remnants of the eight submerged states remained after the flood, but  none of them wanted to surrender its autonomy. The tiny fringe of  Kansas seemed, for a time, ready to merge with contiguous Missouri,  but following the lead of the Arkansas Forever faction, the remaining  population decided to retain political integrity. This has resulted  in the continuing anomaly of the seven \"fringe States\" represented  in Congress by the usual two Senators each, though the largest of  them is barely the size of Connecticut and all are economically  indistinguishable from their neighboring states.\n\n\n Fortunately it was decided some years ago that Oklahoma, only one of  the eight to have completely disappeared, could not in any sense be  considered to have a continuing political existence. So, though there  are still families who proudly call themselves Oklahomans, and the  Oklahoma Oil Company continues to pump oil from its submerged real  estate, the state has in fact disappeared from the American political  scene.\n\n\n But this is by now no more than a petty annoyance, to raise a smile  when the talk gets around to the question of State's Rights. Not even  the tremendous price the country paid for its new sea\u2014fourteen million  dead, untold property destroyed\u2014really offsets the asset we enjoy  today. The heart of the continent, now open to the shipping of the  world, was once dry and land-locked, cut off from the bustle of trade  and the ferment of world culture.\n\n\n It would indeed seem odd to an American of the '50s or '60s of the last  century to imagine sailors from the merchant fleets of every nation  walking the streets of Denver, fresh ashore at Newport, only fifteen  miles away. Or to imagine Lincoln, Fargo, Kansas City and Dallas as  world ports and great manufacturing centers. Utterly beyond their ken  would be Roswell, New Mexico; Benton, Wyoming; Westport, Missouri,  and the other new ports of over a million inhabitants each which have  developed on the new harbors of the inland sea.\n\n\n Unimaginable too would have been the general growth of population  in the states surrounding the new sea. As the water tables rose and  manufacturing and trade moved in to take advantage of the just-created  axis of world communication, a population explosion was touched off of  which we are only now seeing the diminution. This new westering is to  be ranked with the first surge of pioneers which created the American  west. But what a difference! Vacation paradises bloom, a new fishing  industry thrives; her water road is America's main artery of trade, and  fleets of all the world sail ... where once the prairie schooner made  its laborious and dusty way west! \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow has the new Nebraska Sea changed the climate in America? \n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It's brought on much warmer, more tolerable weather. \".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It's much muggier in many places now, and unlivable in others. \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It's much muggier in many places now, and unlivable in others. \" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It's much muggier in many places now, and unlivable in others. \" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It had been a particularly hot and dry August, and the Forestry  Service was keeping an anxious eye out for the fires it knew it could  expect.

The rising cloud was not smoke, but  dust. Thousands of cubic feet of dry earth rising lazily on the summer  air. Rock slides, they guessed; certainly no fire.

Springs was  going dry, too, apparently from underground disturbances. Not even in  the Rockies could anyone remember a series of rock slides as bad as  this.\n\n\n Newspapers in the mountain states gave it a few inches on the front  page; anything is news in late August.

Only Joseph Schwartzberg, head geographer of the Department  of the Interior, wondered if the disturbance might not be a settling  of the Kiowa Fault. His suggestion was mentioned on page nine or ten  of the Monday newspapers (page 27 of the New York Times ). The idea  was not nearly so exciting as a volcano, even a lava-less one, and you  couldn't draw a very dramatic picture of it.\n\n\n To excuse the other geologists, it must be said that the Kiowa Fault  had never acted up before. It never sidestepped, never jiggled,  never, never produced the regular shows of its little sister out in  California, which almost daily bounced San Francisco or Los Angeles, or  some place in between. The dust volcano was on the face of it a more  plausible theory.\n\n\n Still, it was only a theory. It had to be proved. As the tremors grew  bigger, along with the affected area, as several towns including  Edison were shaken to pieces by incredible earthquakes, whole bus- and  plane-loads of geologists set out for Colorado, without even waiting  for their university and government department to approve budgets.\n\n\n They found, of course, that Schwartzberg had been perfectly correct. They found themselves on the scene of what was fast becoming the  most violent and widespread earthquake North America\u2014probably the  world\u2014has ever seen in historic times. To describe it in the simplest  terms, land east of the Fault was settling, and at a precipitous rate.\n\n\n Rock scraped rock with a whining roar. Shuddery as a squeaky piece of  chalk raked across a blackboard, the noise was deafening. The surfaces  of the land east and west of the Fault seemed no longer to have any  relation to each other. To the west, tortured rock reared into cliffs.  East, where sharp reports and muffled wheezes told of continued  buckling and dropping, the earth trembled downward. Atop the new  cliffs, which seemed to grow by sudden inches from heaving rubble, dry  earth fissured and trembled, sliding acres at a time to fall, smoking,  into the bucking, heaving bottom of the depression.\n\n\n There the devastation was even more thorough, if less spectacular.  Dry earth churned like mud, and rock shards weighing tons bumped and  rolled about like pebbles as they shivered and cracked into pebbles  themselves. \"It looks like sand dancing in a child's sieve,\" said the  normally impassive Schwartzberg in a nationwide broadcast from the  scene of disaster. \"No one here has ever seen anything like it.\" And  the landslip was growing, north and south along the Fault.\n\n\n \"Get out while you can,\" Schwartzberg urged the population of the  affected area. \"When it's over you can come back and pick up the  pieces.\" But the band of scientists who had rallied to his leadership  privately wondered if there would be any pieces.\n\n\n The Arkansas River, at Avondale and North Avondale, was sluggishly  backing north into the deepening trough. At the rate things were going,  there might be a new lake the entire length of El Paso and Pueblo  Counties. And, warned Schwartzberg, this might only be the beginning.\n\n\n By 16 September the landslip had crept down the Huerfano River past  Cedarwood. Avondale, North Avondale and Boone had totally disappeared.  Land west of the Fault was holding firm, though Denver had recorded  several small tremors; everywhere east of the Fault, to almost twenty  miles away, the now-familiar lurch and steady fall had already sent  several thousand Coloradans scurrying for safety.\n\n\n All mountain climbing was prohibited on the Eastern Slope because of  the danger of rock slides from minor quakes. The geologists went home  to wait.\n\n\n There wasn't much to wait for. The news got worse and worse. The Platte  River, now, was creating a vast mud puddle where the town of Orchard  had been. Just below Masters, Colorado, the river leaped 70-foot cliffs  to add to the heaving chaos below. And the cliffs were higher every day  as the land beneath them groaned downward in mile-square gulps.\n\n\n As the Fault moved north and south, new areas quivered into unwelcome  life. Fields and whole mountainsides moved with deceptive sloth down,  down. They danced \"like sand in a sieve\"; dry, they boiled into rubble.  Telephone lines, railroad tracks, roads snapped and simply disappeared.  Virtually all east-west land communication was suspended and the  President declared a national emergency. By 23 September the Fault was active well into Wyoming on the north,  and rapidly approaching the border of New Mexico to the south.  Trinchera and Branson were totally evacuated, but even so the over-all  death toll had risen above 1,000.\n\n\n Away to the east the situation was quiet but even more ominous.  Tremendous fissures opened up perpendicular to the Fault, and a general  subsidence of the land was noticeable well into Kansas and Nebraska.  The western borders of these states, and soon of the Dakotas and  Oklahoma as well, were slowly sinking.\n\n\n On the actual scene of the disaster (or the scenes ; it is impossible  to speak of anything this size in the singular) there was a horrifying  confusion. Prairie and hill cracked open under intolerable strains as  the land shuddered downward in gasps and leaps. Springs burst to the  surface in hot geysers and explosions of steam.\n\n\n The downtown section of North Platte, Nebraska, dropped eight feet,  just like that, on the afternoon of 4 October. \"We must remain calm,\"  declared the Governor of Nebraska. \"We must sit this thing out. Be  assured that everything possible is being done.\" But what could be  done, with his state dropping straight down at a mean rate of a foot a  day?\n\n\n The Fault nicked off the south-east corner of Montana. It worked its  way north along the Little Missouri. South, it ripped past Roswell, New  Mexico, and tore down the Pecos toward Texas. All the upper reaches of  the Missouri were standing puddles by now, and the Red River west of  Paris, Texas, had begun to run backward.\n\n\n Soon the Missouri began slowly slipping away westward over the slowly  churning land. Abandoning its bed, the river spread uncertainly across  farmland and prairie, becoming a sea of mud beneath the sharp new  cliffs which rose in rending line, ever taller as the land continued to  sink, almost from Canada to the Mexican border. There were virtually no  floods, in the usual sense. The water moved too slowly, spread itself  with no real direction or force. But the vast sheets of sluggish water  and jelly-like mud formed death-traps for the countless refugees now  streaming east.\n\n\n Perhaps the North Platte disaster had been more than anyone could take.  193 people had died in that one cave-in. Certainly by 7 October it had  to be officially admitted that there was an exodus of epic proportion.  Nearly two million people were on the move, and the U. S. was faced  with a gigantic wave of refugees. Rails, roads and air-lanes were  jammed with terrified hordes who had left everything behind to crowd  eastward.\n\n\n All through October hollow-eyed motorists flocked into Tulsa, Topeka,  Omaha, Sioux Falls and Fargo. St. Louis was made distributing center  for emergency squads which flew everywhere with milk for babies and  dog food for evacuating pets. Gasoline trucks boomed west to meet the  demand for gas, but once inside the \"zone of terror,\" as the newspapers  now called it, they found their route blocked by eastbound cars on the  wrong side of the road. Shops left by their fleeing owners were looted  by refugees from further west; an American Airlines plane was wrecked  by a mob of would-be passengers in Bismarck, North Dakota. Federal and  State troops were called out, but moving two million people was not to  be done in an orderly way.\n\n\n And still the landslip grew larger. The new cliffs gleamed in the  autumn sunshine, growing higher as the land beneath them continued its  inexorable descent.\n\n\n On 21 October, at Lubbock, Texas, there was a noise variously described  as a hollow roar, a shriek and a deep musical vibration like a church  bell. It was simply the tortured rock of the substrata giving way. The  second phase of the national disaster was beginning. The noise traveled due east at better than 85 miles per hour. In its  wake the earth to the north \"just seemed to collapse on itself like  a punctured balloon,\" read one newspaper report. \"Like a cake that's  failed,\" said a Texarkana housewife who fortunately lived a block south of Thayer Street, where the fissure raced through. There  was a sigh and a great cloud of dust, and Oklahoma subsided at the  astounding rate of about six feet per hour.\n\n\n At Biloxi, on the Gulf, there had been uneasy shufflings under foot all  day. \"Not tremors, exactly,\" said the captain of a fishing boat which  was somehow to ride out the coming flood, \"but like as if the land  wanted to be somewhere else.\"\n\n\n Everyone in doomed Biloxi would have done well to have been somewhere  else that evening. At approximately 8:30 p.m. the town shuddered,  seemed to rise a little like the edge of a hall carpet caught in a  draft, and sank. So did the entire Mississippi and Alabama coast, at  about the same moment. The tidal wave which was to gouge the center  from the U. S. marched on the land. From the north shore of Lake Ponchartrain to the Appalachicola River  in Florida, the Gulf coast simply disappeared. Gulfport, Biloxi,  Mobile, Pensacola, Panama City: 200 miles of shoreline vanished, with  over two and a half million people. An hour later a wall of water  had swept over every town from Dothan, Alabama, to Bogalusa on the  Louisiana-Mississippi border.\n\n\n \"We must keep panic from our minds,\" said the Governor of Alabama in a  radio message delivered from a hastily arranged all-station hookup. \"We  of the gallant southland have faced and withstood invasion before.\"  Then, as ominous creakings and groanings of the earth announced the  approach of the tidal wave, he flew out of Montgomery half an hour  before the town disappeared forever.\n\n\n One head of the wave plunged north, eventually to spend itself in  the hills south of Birmingham. The main sweep followed the lowest  land. Reaching west, it swallowed Vicksburg and nicked the corner of  Louisiana. The whole of East Carroll Parish was scoured from the map.\n\n\n The Mississippi River now ended at about Eudora, Arkansas, and minute  by minute the advancing flood bit away miles of river bed, swelling  north. Chicot, Jennie, Lake Village, Arkansas City, Snow Lake, Elaine,  Helena and Memphis felt the tremors. The tormented city shuddered  through the night. The earth continued its descent, eventually tipping  2-1/2 degrees down to the west. The \"Memphis Tilt\" is today one of  the unique and charming characteristics of the gracious Old Town, but  during the night of panic Memphis residents were sure they were doomed. South and west the waters carved deeply into Arkansas and Oklahoma.  By morning it was plain that all of Arkansas was going under. Waves  advanced on Little Rock at almost 100 miles an hour, new crests  forming, overtopping the wave's leading edge as towns, hills and the  thirst of the soil temporarily broke the furious charge.\n\n\n Washington announced the official hope that the Ozarks would stop the  wild gallop of the unleashed Gulf, for in northwest Arkansas the land  rose to over 2,000 feet. But nothing could save Oklahoma. By noon the  water reached clutching fingers around Mt. Scott and Elk Mountain,  deluging Hobart and almost all of Greer County.\n\n\n Despite hopeful announcements that the wave was slowing, had virtually  stopped after inundating Oklahoma City, was being swallowed up in the  desert near Amarillo, the wall of water continued its advance. For the  land was still sinking, and the floods were constantly replenished from  the Gulf. Schwartzberg and his geologists advised the utmost haste in  evacuating the entire area between Colorado and Missouri, from Texas to  North Dakota.\n\n\n Lubbock, Texas, went under. On a curling reflex the tidal wave blotted  out Sweetwater and Big Spring. The Texas panhandle disappeared in one  great swirl.\n\n\n Whirlpools opened. A great welter of smashed wood and human debris was  sucked under, vomited up and pounded to pieces. Gulf-water crashed on  the cliffs of New Mexico and fell back on itself in foam. Would-be  rescuers on the cliffs along what had been the west bank of the Pecos  River afterwards recalled the hiss and scream like tearing silk as  the water broke furiously on the newly exposed rock. It was the most  terrible sound they had ever heard.\n\n\n \"We couldn't hear any shouts, of course, not that far away and with all  the noise,\" said Dan Weaver, Mayor of Carlsbad. \"But we knew there  were people down there. When the water hit the cliffs, it was like a  collision between two solid bodies. We couldn't see for over an hour,  because of the spray.\" Salt spray. The ocean had come to New Mexico. The cliffs proved to be the only effective barrier against the westward  march of the water, which turned north, gouging out lumps of rock and  tumbling down blocks of earth onto its own back. In places scoops of  granite came out like ice cream. The present fishing town of Rockport,  Colorado, is built on a harbor created in such a way.\n\n\n The water had found its farthest westering. But still it poured north  along the line of the original Fault. Irresistible fingers closed on  Sterling, Colorado, on Sidney, Nebraska, on Hot Springs, South Dakota.  The entire tier of states settled, from south to north, down to its  eventual place of stability one thousand feet below the level of the  new sea.\n\n\n Memphis was by now a seaport. The Ozarks, islands in a mad sea, formed  precarious havens for half-drowned humanity. Waves bit off a corner of  Missouri, flung themselves on Wichita. Topeka, Lawrence and Belleville  were the last Kansas towns to disappear. The Governor of Kansas went  down with his State.\n\n\n Daniel Bernd of Lincoln, Nebraska, was washed up half-drowned in a cove  of the Wyoming cliffs, having been sucked from one end of vanished  Nebraska to the other. Similar hair-breadth escapes were recounted on  radio and television.\n\n\n Virtually the only people saved out of the entire population of Pierre,  South Dakota were the six members of the Creeth family. Plucky Timothy  Creeth carried and dragged his aged parents to the loft of their barn  on the outskirts of town. His brother Geoffrey brought along the  younger children and what provisions they could find\u2014\"Mostly a ham  and about half a ton of vanilla cookies,\" he explained to his eventual  rescuers. The barn, luckily collapsing in the vibrations as the waves  bore down on them, became an ark in which they rode out the disaster.\n\n\n \"We must of played cards for four days straight,\" recalled genial  Mrs. Creeth when she afterwards appeared on a popular television  spectacular. Her rural good-humor undamaged by an ordeal few women can  ever have been called on to face, she added, \"We sure wondered why  flushes never came out right. Jimanettly, we'd left the king of hearts  behind, in the rush!\"\n\n\n But such lightheartedness and such happy endings were by no means  typical. The world could only watch aghast as the water raced north  under the shadow of the cliffs which occasionally crumbled, roaring,  into the roaring waves. Day by day the relentless rush swallowed what  had been dusty farmland, cities and towns.\n\n\n Some people were saved by the helicopters which flew mercy missions  just ahead of the advancing waters. Some found safety in the peaks of  western Nebraska and the Dakotas. But when the waters came to rest  along what is roughly the present shoreline of our inland sea, it was  estimated that over fourteen million people had lost their lives.\n\n\n No one could even estimate the damage to property; almost the entirety  of eight states, and portions of twelve others, had simply vanished  from the heart of the North American continent forever. It was in such a cataclysmic birth that the now-peaceful Nebraska Sea  came to America.\n\n\n Today, nearly one hundred years after the unprecedented\u2014and happily  unrepeated\u2014disaster, it is hard to remember the terror and despair of  those weeks in October and November, 1973. It is inconceivable to think  of the United States without its beautiful and economically essential  curve of interior ocean. Two-thirds as long as the Mediterranean,  it graduates from the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico through the  equally blue waves of the Mississippi Bight, becoming cooler and  greener north and west of the pleasant fishing isles of the Ozark  Archipelago, finally shading into the gray-green chop of the Gulf of  Dakota.\n\n\n What would the United States have become without the 5600-mile  coastline of our inland sea? It is only within the last twenty years  that any but the topmost layer of water has cleared sufficiently  to permit a really extensive fishing industry. Mud still held in  suspension by the restless waves will not precipitate fully even in our  lifetimes. Even so, the commercial fisheries of Missouri and Wyoming  contribute no small part to the nation's economy. Who can imagine what the middle west must have been like before the  amelioration of climate brought about by the proximity of a warm sea?  The now-temperate state of Minnesota (to say nothing of the submerged  Dakotas) must have been Siberian. From contemporary accounts Missouri,  our second California, was unbelievably muggy, almost uninhabitable  during the summer months. Our climate today, from Ohio and North  Carolina to the rich fields of New Mexico and the orchards of Montana,  is directly ameliorated by the marine heart of the continent. Who today could imagine the United States without the majestic  sea-cliffs in stately parade from New Mexico to Montana? The beaches  of Wyoming, the American Riviera, where fruit trees grow almost to the  water's edge? Or incredible Colorado, where the morning skier is the  afternoon bather, thanks to the monorail connecting the highest peaks  with the glistening white beaches? Of course there have been losses to balance slightly these strong  gains. The Mississippi was, before 1973, one of the great rivers of  the world. Taken together with its main tributary, the Missouri, it  vied favorably with such giant systems as the Amazon and the Ganges.  Now, ending as it does at Memphis and drawing its water chiefly from  the Appalachian Mountains, it is only a slight remnant of what it was.  And though the Nebraska Sea today carries many times the tonnage of  shipping in its ceaseless traffic, we have lost the old romance of  river shipping. We may only guess what it was like when we look upon  the Ohio and the truncated Mississippi.\n\n\n And transcontinental shipping is somewhat more difficult, with trucks  and the freight-railroads obliged to take the sea-ferries across the  Nebraska Sea. We shall never know what the United States was like with  its numerous coast-to-coast highways busy with trucks and private  cars. Still, the ferry ride is certainly a welcome break after days of  driving, and for those who wish a glimpse of what it must have been  like, there is always the Cross-Canada Throughway and the magnificent  U. S. Highway 73 looping north through Minnesota and passing through  the giant port of Alexis, North Dakota, shipping center for the wheat  of Manitoba and crossroad of a nation. The political situation has long been a thorny problem. Only tattered  remnants of the eight submerged states remained after the flood, but  none of them wanted to surrender its autonomy. The tiny fringe of  Kansas seemed, for a time, ready to merge with contiguous Missouri,  but following the lead of the Arkansas Forever faction, the remaining  population decided to retain political integrity. This has resulted  in the continuing anomaly of the seven \"fringe States\" represented  in Congress by the usual two Senators each, though the largest of  them is barely the size of Connecticut and all are economically  indistinguishable from their neighboring states.\n\n\n Fortunately it was decided some years ago that Oklahoma, only one of  the eight to have completely disappeared, could not in any sense be  considered to have a continuing political existence. So, though there  are still families who proudly call themselves Oklahomans, and the  Oklahoma Oil Company continues to pump oil from its submerged real  estate, the state has in fact disappeared from the American political  scene.\n\n\n But this is by now no more than a petty annoyance, to raise a smile  when the talk gets around to the question of State's Rights. Not even  the tremendous price the country paid for its new sea\u2014fourteen million  dead, untold property destroyed\u2014really offsets the asset we enjoy  today. The heart of the continent, now open to the shipping of the  world, was once dry and land-locked, cut off from the bustle of trade  and the ferment of world culture.\n\n\n It would indeed seem odd to an American of the '50s or '60s of the last  century to imagine sailors from the merchant fleets of every nation  walking the streets of Denver, fresh ashore at Newport, only fifteen  miles away. Or to imagine Lincoln, Fargo, Kansas City and Dallas as  world ports and great manufacturing centers. Utterly beyond their ken  would be Roswell, New Mexico; Benton, Wyoming; Westport, Missouri,  and the other new ports of over a million inhabitants each which have  developed on the new harbors of the inland sea.\n\n\n Unimaginable too would have been the general growth of population  in the states surrounding the new sea. As the water tables rose and  manufacturing and trade moved in to take advantage of the just-created  axis of world communication, a population explosion was touched off of  which we are only now seeing the diminution. This new westering is to  be ranked with the first surge of pioneers which created the American  west. But what a difference! Vacation paradises bloom, a new fishing  industry thrives; her water road is America's main artery of trade, and  fleets of all the world sail ... where once the prairie schooner made  its laborious and dusty way west! \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow has the new Nebraska Sea changed the climate in America? \n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It's brought on much warmer, more tolerable weather. \".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It's much muggier in many places now, and unlivable in others. \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It's much muggier in many places now, and unlivable in others. \" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It's much muggier in many places now, and unlivable in others. \" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
