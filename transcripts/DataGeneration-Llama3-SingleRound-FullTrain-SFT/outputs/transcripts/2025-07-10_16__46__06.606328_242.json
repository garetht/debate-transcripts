      "background_text": "QUEST OF THIG By BASIL WELLS Thig of Ortha was the vanguard of the conquering\n\n \"HORDE.\" He had blasted across trackless space\n\n to subdue a defenseless world\u2014only to meet on\n\n Earth emotions that were more deadly than weapons.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Thig carefully smoothed the dark sand and seaweed of the lonely beach  over the metal lid of the flexible ringed tunnel that linked the grubby  ship from another planet with the upper air. He looked out across the  heaving waters of the Sound toward Connecticut. He stared appraisingly  around at the luxuriant green growth of foliage further inland; and  started toward the little stretch of trees and brush, walking carefully  because of the lesser gravitation.\n\n\n Thig was shorter than the average Earthman\u2014although on Ortha he  was well above the average in height\u2014but his body was thick and  powerfully muscled. His skull was well-shaped and large; his features  were regular, perhaps a trifle oversize, and his hair and eyes were  a curiously matching blend of reddish brown. Oddest of all, he wore  no garments, other than the necessary belt and straps to support his  rod-like weapon of white metal and his pouches for food and specimens.\n\n\n The Orthan entered the narrow strip of trees and crossed to the  little-used highway on the other side. Here he patiently sat down to  wait for an Earthman or an Earthwoman to pass. His task now was to  bring a native, intact if possible, back to the carefully buried space  cruiser where his two fellows and himself would drain the creature's  mentality of all its knowledge. In this way they could learn whether a  planet was suited for colonization by later swarms of Orthans.\n\n\n Already they had charted over a hundred celestial bodies but of them  all only three had proven worthy of consideration. This latest planet,  however, 72-P-3 on the chart, appeared to be an ideal world in every  respect. Sunlight, plenty of water and a dense atmospheric envelope  made of 72-P-3 a paradise among planets.\n\n\n The explorer from another world crouched into the concealment of a  leafy shrub. A creature was approaching. Its squat body was covered  with baggy strips of bluish cloth and it carried a jointed rod of metal  and wood in its paw. It walked upright as did the men of Ortha.\n\n\n Thig's cold eyes opened a trifle wider as he stared into the thing's  stupid face. It was as though he was looking into a bit of polished  metal at the reflection of himself!\n\n\n The Earthman was opposite now and he must waste no more precious  time. The mighty muscles of the Orthan sent him hurtling across the  intervening space in two prodigious bounds, and his hands clamped  across the mouth and neck of the stranger.... Lewis Terry was going fishing. For a week the typewriter mill that had  ground out a thousand assorted yarns of the untamed West and the frigid  desolation of the Northwoods had been silent. Lewis wondered if he was  going stale. He had sat every day for eight hours in front of that  shiny-buttoned bane of the typist, but there were no results. Feebly  he had punched a key two days ago and a $ sign had appeared. He hadn't  dared touch the machine since.\n\n\n For Mr. Terry, that hard-hitting writer of two-gun action, had never  been further west of Long Island than Elizabeth, and he had promised  his wife, Ellen, that he would take the three children and herself on  a trailer tour of the West that very summer. Since that promise, he  could not write a word. Visions of whooping red-skinned Apaches and  be-chapped outlaws raiding his little trailer home kept rolling up out  of his subconscious. Yet he had to write at least three novelets and  a fistful of short stories in the next two weeks to finance the great  adventure\u2014or the trip was off.\n\n\n So Lewis left the weathered old cottage in the early dawn and headed  for his tubby old boat at the landing in an attempt to work out a  salable yarn....\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he shouted as a naked man sprang out of the bushes beside the  road. \"What's the trouble?\"\n\n\n Then he had no time for further speech, the massive arms of the  stranger had wound around him and two hamlike hands shut off his speech  and his wind. He fought futilely against trained muscles. The hand  clamping his throat relaxed for a moment and hacked along the side of  his head. Blackness flooded the brain of Lewis, and he knew no more. \"There it is,\" announced Thig, dropping the limp body of the captured  Earthman to the metal deck-plates. \"It is a male of the species that  must have built the cities we saw as we landed.\"\n\n\n \"He resembles Thig,\" announced Kam. \"But for the strange covering he  wears he might be Thig.\"\n\n\n \"Thig will be this creature!\" announced Torp. \"With a psychic relay we  will transfer the Earthman's memories and meager store of knowledge to  the brain of Thig! He can then go out and scout this world without  arousing suspicion. While he is gone, I will take Kam and explore the  two inner planets.\"\n\n\n \"You are the commander,\" said Thig. \"But I wish this beast did not wear  these clumsy sheathing upon his body. On Ortha we do not hamper the use  of our limbs so.\"\n\n\n \"Do not question the word of your commander,\" growled Torp, swelling  out his thick chest menacingly. \"It is for the good of our people that  you disguise yourself as an Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"For the good of the Horde,\" Thig intoned almost piously as he lifted  Terry's body and headed for the laboratory.\n\n\n Service for the Horde was all that the men of Ortha knew. Carefully  cultured and brought to life in the laboratories of their Horde, they  knew neither father nor mother. Affection and love were entirely  lacking in their early training and later life. They were trained  antlike from childhood that only the growth and power of the Horde  were of any moment. Men and women alike toiled and died like unfeeling  robots of flesh and bone for the Horde. The Horde was their religion,  their love-life, their everything!\n\n\n So it was that the bodies of the Earthman and the Orthan were strapped  on two parallel tables of chill metal and the twin helmets, linked to  one another by the intricacies of the psychic relay, put upon their  heads.\n\n\n For ten hours or more the droning hum of the relay sucked Terry's brain  dry of knowledge. The shock upon the nervous system of the Earthman  proved too violent and his heart faltered after a time and stopped  completely. Twice, with subtle drugs they restored pseudo-life to his  body and kept the electrical impulses throbbing from his tortured  brain, but after the third suspension of life Thig removed his helmet.\n\n\n \"There is nothing more to learn,\" he informed his impassive comrades.  \"Now, let us get on with the plastic surgery that is required. My new  body must return to its barbaric household before undue attention is  aroused. And when I return I will take along some of the gleaming  baubles we found on the red planet\u2014these people value them highly.\"\n\n\n An hour later, his scars and altered cartilage already healed and  painless, Thig again scraped sand over the entrance to the space ship  and set out along the moonlit beach toward the nearest path running  inland to his home.\n\n\n Memory was laying the country bare about him, Terry's own childhood  memories of this particular section of Long Island. Here was the place  where Jake and Ted had helped him dig for the buried treasure that  old 'Notch-ear' Beggs had told them so exactly about. Remembrance of  that episode gave Thig an idea about the little lump of jewels in his  pocket. He had found them in a chest along the beach!\n\n\n He was coming up on the porch now and at the sound of his foot on  the sagging boards the screen door burst open and three little  Earth-creatures were hugging at his legs. An odd sensation, that his  acquired memories labeled as pleasure, sent a warm glow upward from  around his heart.\n\n\n Then he saw the slender red-haired shape of a woman, the mate of the  dead man he knew, and confusion struck his well-trained brain. Men  had no mates on Ortha, sex had been overthrown with all the other  primitive impulses of barbarism; so he was incapable of understanding  the emotions that swept through his acquired memory.\n\n\n Unsteadily he took her in his arms and felt her warm lips pressed,  trembling, against his own. That same hot wave of pulsing blood choked  achingly up into his throat.\n\n\n \"Lew, dear,\" Ellen was asking, \"where have you been all day? I called  up at the landing but you were not there. I wanted to let you know that  Saddlebag Publications sent a check for $50 for \"Reversed Revolvers\"  and three other editors asked for shorts soon.\" \"Shoulda got a hundred bucks for that yarn,\" grunted Thig, and gasped.\n\n\n For the moment he had been Lewis Terry and not Thig! So thoroughly had  he acquired the knowledge of Terry that he found himself unconsciously  adopting the thinking and mannerism of the other. All the better this  way, he realized\u2014more natural.\n\n\n \"Sorry I was late,\" he said, digging into his pocket for the  glittering baubles, \"but I was poking around on the beach where we used  to hunt treasure and I found an old chest. Inside it I found nothing  but a handful of these.\"\n\n\n He flashed the jewels in front of Ellen's startled eyes and she clung,  unbelieving, to his arm.\n\n\n \"Why, Lew,\" she gasped, \"they're worth a fortune! We can buy that new  trailer now and have a rebuilt motor in the car. We can go west right  away.... Hollywood, the Grand Canyon, cowboys!\"\n\n\n \"Uh huh,\" agreed the pseudo Lewis, memories of the ferocious savages  and gunmen of his stories rendering him acutely unhappy. Sincerely he  hoped that the west had reformed.\n\n\n \"I saved some kraut and weiners,\" Ellen said. \"Get washed up while I'm  warming them up. Kids ate all the bread so I had to borrow some from  the Eskoes. Want coffee, too?\"\n\n\n \"Mmmmmm,\" came from the depths of the chipped white wash-basin. \"Home again,\" whispered Ellen as she stood beside Thig twelve weeks  later and gazed tearfully at the weathered little gray house. She knelt  beside the front stoop and reached for the key hidden beneath it.\n\n\n \"The west was wonderful; tremendous, vast and beautiful,\" she went  on as they climbed the steps, \"but nowhere was there any place as  beautiful as our own little strip of sky and water.\"\n\n\n Thig sank into a dusty old swing that hung on creaking chains from the  exposed rafters of the porch roof. He looked down at the dusty gray car  and the bulbous silvery bulk of the trailer that had been their living  quarters for almost three months. Strange thoughts were afloat in the  chaos of his cool Orthan brain.\n\n\n Tonight or tomorrow night at the latest he must contact his two fellows  and report that Earth was a planetary paradise. No other world,  including Ortha, was so well-favored and rich. An expeditionary force  to wipe the grotesque civilizations of Earth out of existence would,  of course, be necessary before the first units of new Hordes could be  landed. And there Thig balked. Why must they destroy these people,  imperfect though their civilization might be, to make room for the  Hordes?\n\n\n Thig tried to tell himself that it was the transmitted thoughts of the  dead Earthman that made him feel so, but he was not too sure. For three  months he had lived with people who loved, hated, wept and sacrificed  for reasons that he had never known existed. He had learned the heady  glory of thinking for himself and making his own decisions. He had  experienced the primitive joy of matching his wits and tongue against  the wits of other unpredictable human beings. There was no abrupt  division of men and women into definite classes of endeavor. A laborer  thought the same thoughts that a governor might think. Uncertainty  added zest to every day's life.\n\n\n The Orthan had come to question the sole devotion of the individual to  the Horde to the exclusion of all other interests. What, he wondered,  would one new world\u2014or a hundred\u2014populated by the Hordes add to  the progress of humanity? For a hundred thousand years the Orthan  civilization had remained static, its energies directed into certain  well-defined channels. They were mindless bees maintaining their vast  mechanical hives.\n\n\n There was that moment on the brink of the Grand Canyon when Ellen had  caught his arm breathlessly at all the beauty spread away there beneath  them. There were mornings in the desert when the sun painted in lurid  red the peaks above the harsh black-and-whites of the sagebrush and  cactus slopes. There was the little boy, his body burning with fever,  who nestled trustingly against his tense man's body and slept\u2014the son  of Ellen and the man he had destroyed.\n\n\n Thig groaned. He was a weakling to let sentimentality so get the better  of his judgment. He would go now to the space ship and urge them to  blast off for Ortha. He sprang off the porch and strode away down the  road toward the beach.\n\n\n The children ran to him; wanted to go along. He sent them away harshly  but they smiled and waved their brown little hands. Ellen came to the  door and called after him.\n\n\n \"Hurry home, dear,\" she said. \"I'll have a bite ready in about an hour.\"\n\n\n He dared not say anything, for his voice would have broken and she  would have known something was wrong. She was a very wise sort of  person when something was troubling him. He waved his stubby paw of a  hand to show that he had heard, and blindly hurried toward the Sound.\n\n\n Oddly enough, as he hurried away along the narrow path through the  autumn woods, his mind busied itself with a new epic of the west that  lived no longer. He mentally titled it: \"Rustlers' Riot\" and blocked  in the outlines of his plot. One section of his brain was that of the  careless author of gunslinging yarns, a section that seemed to be  sapping the life from his own brain. He knew that the story would never  be written, but he toyed with the idea.\n\n\n So far had Thig the emotionless, robot-being from Ortha drifted from  the unquestioning worship of the Horde! \"You have done well,\" announced Torp when Thig had completed his report  on the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. \"We now  have located three worlds fit for colonization and so we will return to  Ortha at once.\n\n\n \"I will recommend the conquest of this planet, 72-P-3 at once and the  complete destruction of all biped life upon it. The mental aberrations  of the barbaric natives might lead to endless complications if they  were permitted to exist outside our ordered way of life. I imagine that  three circuits of the planet about its primary should prove sufficient  for the purposes of complete liquidation.\"\n\n\n \"But why,\" asked Thig slowly, \"could we not disarm all the natives and  exile them on one of the less desirable continents, Antarctica for  example or Siberia? They are primitive humans even as our race was once  a race of primitives. It is not our duty to help to attain our own  degree of knowledge and comfort?\"\n\n\n \"Only the good of the Horde matters!\" shouted Torp angrily. \"Shall a  race of feeble-witted beasts, such as these Earthmen, stand in the way  of a superior race? We want their world, and so we will take it. The  Law of the Horde states that all the universe is ours for the taking.\"\n\n\n \"Let us get back to Ortha at once, then,\" gritted out Thig savagely.  \"Never again do I wish to set foot upon the soil of this mad planet.  There are forces at work upon Earth that we of Ortha have long  forgotten.\"\n\n\n \"Check the blood of Thig for disease, Kam,\" ordered Torp shortly. \"His  words are highly irrational. Some form of fever perhaps native to this  world. While you examine him I will blast off for Ortha.\"\n\n\n Thig followed Kam into the tiny laboratory and found a seat beside the  squat scientist's desk. His eyes roamed over the familiar instruments  and gauges, each in its own precise position in the cases along the  walls. His gaze lingered longest on the stubby black ugliness of  a decomposition blaster in its rack close to the deck. A blast of  the invisible radiations from that weapon's hot throat and flesh or  vegetable fiber rotted into flaky ashes.\n\n\n The ship trembled beneath their feet; it tore free from the feeble  clutch of the sand about it, and they were rocketing skyward. Thig's  broad fingers bit deep into the unyielding metal of his chair. Suddenly  he knew that he must go back to Earth, back to Ellen and the children  of the man he had helped destroy. He loved Ellen, and nothing must  stand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, an  empty world\u2014this planet was not for them.\n\n\n \"Turn back!\" he cried wildly. \"I must go back to Earth. There is a  woman there, helpless and alone, who needs me! The Horde does not need  this planet.\"\n\n\n Kam eyed him coldly and lifted a shining hypodermic syringe from its  case. He approached Thig warily, aware that disease often made a maniac  of the finest members of the Horde.\n\n\n \"No human being is more important than the Horde,\" he stated baldly.  \"This woman of whom you speak is merely one unit of the millions we  must eliminate for the good of the Horde.\"\n\n\n Then it was that Thig went berserk. His fists slashed into the thick  jaw of the scientist and his fingers ripped at the hard cords overlying  the Orthan's vital throat tubes. His fingers and thumb gouged deep into  Kam's startled throat and choked off any cry for assistance before it  could be uttered.\n\n\n Kam's hand swept down to the holster swung from his intricate harness  and dragged his blaster from it. Thig's other hand clamped over his and  for long moments they swayed there, locked together in silent deadly  struggle. The fate of a world hung in the balance as Kam's other hand  fought against that lone arm of Thig. The scales swung in favor of Kam. Slowly the flaring snout of his  weapon tilted upward until it reached the level of Thig's waist. Thig  suddenly released his grip and dragged his enemy toward him. A sudden  reversal of pressure on Kam's gun hand sent the weapon swivelling  about full upon its owner's thick torso. Thig's fingers pressed down  upon Kam's button finger, down upon the stud set into the grip of the  decomposition blaster, and Kam's muscles turned to water. He shrieked.\n\n\n Before Thig's eyes half of his comrade's body sloughed away into foul  corruption that swiftly gave way to hardened blobs of dessicated  matter. Horror for what he had done\u2014that he had slain one of his own  Horde\u2014made his limbs move woodenly. All of his thoughts were dulled  for the moment. Painfully slow, he turned his body around toward the  control blister, turned around on leaden feet, to look full into the  narrowed icy eyes of his commander.\n\n\n He saw the heavy barrel of the blaster slashing down against his  skull but he could not swing a fraction of an inch out of the way.  His body seemed paralyzed. This was the end, he thought as he waited  stupidly for the blow to fall, the end for Ellen and the kids and all  the struggling races of Earth. He would never write another cowboy  yarn\u2014they would all be dead anyhow soon.\n\n\n Then a thunderclap exploded against his head and he dropped endlessly  toward the deck. Blows rained against his skull. He wondered if Torp  would ever cease to hammer at him and turn the deadly ray of the weapon  upon him. Blood throbbed and pounded with every blow.... Bam, Bam, Bam, the blood pounded in his ears. Like repeated blows of a  hammer they shook his booming head. No longer was Torp above him. He  was in the corner of the laboratory, a crumpled blood-smeared heap of  bruised flesh and bone. He was unfettered and the blood was caked upon  his skull and in his matted hair. Torp must have thought he had killed  him with those savage blows upon the head.\n\n\n Even Torp, thought Thig ruefully, gave way to the primitive rage of his  ancestors at times; but to that very bit of unconscious atavism he now  owed his life. A cool-headed robot of an Orthan would have efficiently  used the blaster to destroy any possibility of remaining life in his  unconscious body.\n\n\n Thig rolled slowly over so that his eye found the door into the control  room. Torp would be coming back again to dispose of their bodies  through the refuse lock. Already the body of Kam was gone. He wondered  why he had been left until last. Perhaps Torp wished to take cultures  of his blood and tissues to determine whether a disease was responsible  for his sudden madness.\n\n\n The cases of fragile instruments were just above his head. Association  of memories brought him the flash of the heavy blaster in its rack  beneath them. His hand went up and felt the welcome hardness of the  weapon. He tugged it free.\n\n\n In a moment he was on his knees crawling across the plates of the deck  toward the door. Halfway across the floor he collapsed on his face,  the metal of the gun making a harsh clang. He heard the feet of Torp  scuffle out of silence and a choked cry in the man's throat squalled  out into a senseless whinny.\n\n\n Thig raised himself up on a quivering elbow and slid the black length  of the blaster in front of him. His eyes sought the doorway and stared  full into the glaring vacant orbs of his commander. Torp leaned there  watching him, his breath gurgling brokenly through his deep-bitten  lips. The clawing marks of nails, fingernails, furrowed his face and  chest. He was a madman!\n\n\n The deadly attack of Thig; his own violent avenging of Kam's death, and  now the apparent return of the man he had killed come to life had all  served to jolt his rigidly trained brain from its accustomed groove.  The shock had been too much for the established thought-processes of  the Orthan.\n\n\n So Thig shot him where he stood, mercifully, before that vacant mad  stare set him, too, to gibbering and shrieking. Then he stepped over  the skeleton-thing that had been Torp, using the new strength that  victory had given him to drive him along.\n\n\n He had saved a world's civilization from extinction! The thought  sobered him; yet, somehow, he was pleased that he had done so. After  all, it had been the Earthwoman and the children he had been thinking  of while he battled Kam, a selfish desire to protect them all.\n\n\n He went to the desk where Torp had been writing in the ship's log and  read the last few nervously scrawled lines: Planet 72-P-3 unfit for colonization. Some pernicious disease that  strikes at the brain centers and causes violent insanity is existent  there. Thig, just returned from a survey of the planet, went mad and  destroyed Kam. In turn I was forced to slay him. But it is not ended.  Already I feel the insidious virus of.... And there his writing ended abruptly.\n\n\n Thig nodded. That would do it. He set the automatic pilot for the  planet Ortha. Unless a rogue asteroid or a comet crossed the ship's  path she would return safely to Ortha with that mute warning of danger  on 72-P-3. The body of Torp would help to confirm his final message.\n\n\n Then Thig crossed the cabin to the auxiliary life boat there, one of  a half-dozen space ships in miniature nested within the great ship's  hull, and cut free from the mother vessel.\n\n\n He flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the rockets driving  him from the parent ship. The sensation of free flight against his new  body was strangely exhilerating and heady. It was the newest of the  emotions he had experienced on Earth since that day, so many months  before, when he had felt the warmness of Ellen's lips tight against his. Thig flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the  rockets driving him from the parent ship. He swung about to the port, watched the flaming drive-rockets of the  great exploratory ship hurl it toward far-away Ortha, and there was no  regret in his mind that he was not returning to the planet of his first  existence.\n\n\n He thought of the dull greys and blacks of his planet, of the  monotonous routine of existence that had once been his\u2014and his heart  thrilled to the memories of the starry nights and perfect exciting days  he had spent on his three month trip over Earth.\n\n\n He made a brief salute to the existence he had known, turned with a  tiny sigh, and his fingers made brief adjustments in the controls. The  rocket-thrum deepened, and the thin whistle of tenuous air clutching  the ship echoed through the hull-plates.\n\n\n He thought of many things in those few moments. He watched the  roundness of Earth flatten out, then take on the cup-like illusion  that all planets had for an incoming ship. He reduced the drive of his  rockets to a mere whisper, striving to control the impatience that  crowded his mind.\n\n\n He shivered suddenly, remembering his utter callousness the first time  he had sent a space ship whipping down toward the hills and valleys  below. And there was a sickness within him when he fully realized that,  despite his acquired memory and traits, he was an alien from outer  space.\n\n\n He fingered the tiny scars that had completely obliterated the slight  differences in his appearance from an Earthman's, and his fingers  trembled a bit, as he bent and stared through the vision port. He said  a brief prayer in his heart to a God whose presence he now felt very  deeply. There were tears in the depths of his eyes, then, and memories  were hot, bitter pains. Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he  heaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's  creation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the  West. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and  now, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n\n\n The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be  a knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her  dreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n\n\n The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines  of Long Island in the growing twilight.\n\n\n A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a  cowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.  He had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about  them....\n\n\n He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that! ",

He looked out across the  heaving waters of the Sound toward Connecticut. He stared appraisingly  around at the luxuriant green growth of foliage further inland; and  started toward the little stretch of trees and brush, walking carefully  because of the lesser gravitation.\n\n\n Thig was shorter than the average Earthman\u2014although on Ortha he  was well above the average in height\u2014but his body was thick and  powerfully muscled. His skull was well-shaped and large; his features  were regular, perhaps a trifle oversize, and his hair and eyes were  a curiously matching blend of reddish brown. Oddest of all, he wore  no garments, other than the necessary belt and straps to support his  rod-like weapon of white metal and his pouches for food and specimens.\n\n\n The Orthan entered the narrow strip of trees and crossed to the  little-used highway on the other side. Here he patiently sat down to  wait for an Earthman or an Earthwoman to pass. His task now was to  bring a native, intact if possible, back to the carefully buried space  cruiser where his two fellows and himself would drain the creature's  mentality of all its knowledge. In this way they could learn whether a  planet was suited for colonization by later swarms of Orthans.\n\n\n Already they had charted over a hundred celestial bodies but of them  all only three had proven worthy of consideration. This latest planet,  however, 72-P-3 on the chart, appeared to be an ideal world in every  respect. Sunlight, plenty of water and a dense atmospheric envelope  made of 72-P-3 a paradise among planets.\n\n\n The explorer from another world crouched into the concealment of a  leafy shrub. A creature was approaching. Its squat body was covered  with baggy strips of bluish cloth and it carried a jointed rod of metal  and wood in its paw. It walked upright as did the men of Ortha.\n\n\n Thig's cold eyes opened a trifle wider as he stared into the thing's  stupid face. It was as though he was looking into a bit of polished  metal at the reflection of himself!\n\n\n The Earthman was opposite now and he must waste no more precious  time. The mighty muscles of the Orthan sent him hurtling across the  intervening space in two prodigious bounds, and his hands clamped  across the mouth and neck of the stranger.... Lewis Terry was going fishing. For a week the typewriter mill that had  ground out a thousand assorted yarns of the untamed West and the frigid  desolation of the Northwoods had been silent. Lewis wondered if he was  going stale. He had sat every day for eight hours in front of that  shiny-buttoned bane of the typist, but there were no results. Feebly  he had punched a key two days ago and a $ sign had appeared. He hadn't  dared touch the machine since.\n\n\n For Mr. Terry, that hard-hitting writer of two-gun action, had never  been further west of Long Island than Elizabeth, and he had promised  his wife, Ellen, that he would take the three children and herself on  a trailer tour of the West that very summer. Since that promise, he  could not write a word. Visions of whooping red-skinned Apaches and  be-chapped outlaws raiding his little trailer home kept rolling up out  of his subconscious. Yet he had to write at least three novelets and  a fistful of short stories in the next two weeks to finance the great  adventure\u2014or the trip was off.\n\n\n So Lewis left the weathered old cottage in the early dawn and headed  for his tubby old boat at the landing in an attempt to work out a  salable yarn....\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he shouted as a naked man sprang out of the bushes beside the  road. \"What's the trouble?\"\n\n\n Then he had no time for further speech, the massive arms of the  stranger had wound around him and two hamlike hands shut off his speech  and his wind. He fought futilely against trained muscles. The hand  clamping his throat relaxed for a moment and hacked along the side of  his head. Blackness flooded the brain of Lewis, and he knew no more. \"There it is,\" announced Thig, dropping the limp body of the captured  Earthman to the metal deck-plates. \"It is a male of the species that  must have built the cities we saw as we landed.\"\n\n\n \"He resembles Thig,\" announced Kam. \"But for the strange covering he  wears he might be Thig.\"\n\n\n \"Thig will be this creature!\" announced Torp. \"With a psychic relay we  will transfer the Earthman's memories and meager store of knowledge to  the brain of Thig! He can then go out and scout this world without  arousing suspicion. While he is gone, I will take Kam and explore the  two inner planets.\"\n\n\n \"You are the commander,\" said Thig. \"But I wish this beast did not wear  these clumsy sheathing upon his body. On Ortha we do not hamper the use  of our limbs so.\"\n\n\n \"Do not question the word of your commander,\" growled Torp, swelling  out his thick chest menacingly. \"It is for the good of our people that  you disguise yourself as an Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"For the good of the Horde,\" Thig intoned almost piously as he lifted  Terry's body and headed for the laboratory.\n\n\n Service for the Horde was all that the men of Ortha knew. Carefully  cultured and brought to life in the laboratories of their Horde, they  knew neither father nor mother. Affection and love were entirely  lacking in their early training and later life. They were trained  antlike from childhood that only the growth and power of the Horde  were of any moment. Men and women alike toiled and died like unfeeling  robots of flesh and bone for the Horde. The Horde was their religion,  their love-life, their everything!\n\n\n So it was that the bodies of the Earthman and the Orthan were strapped  on two parallel tables of chill metal and the twin helmets, linked to  one another by the intricacies of the psychic relay, put upon their  heads.\n\n\n For ten hours or more the droning hum of the relay sucked Terry's brain  dry of knowledge. The shock upon the nervous system of the Earthman  proved too violent and his heart faltered after a time and stopped  completely. Twice, with subtle drugs they restored pseudo-life to his  body and kept the electrical impulses throbbing from his tortured  brain, but after the third suspension of life Thig removed his helmet.\n\n\n \"There is nothing more to learn,\" he informed his impassive comrades.  \"Now, let us get on with the plastic surgery that is required. My new  body must return to its barbaric household before undue attention is  aroused. And when I return I will take along some of the gleaming  baubles we found on the red planet\u2014these people value them highly.\"\n\n\n An hour later, his scars and altered cartilage already healed and  painless, Thig again scraped sand over the entrance to the space ship  and set out along the moonlit beach toward the nearest path running  inland to his home.\n\n\n Memory was laying the country bare about him, Terry's own childhood  memories of this particular section of Long Island. Here was the place  where Jake and Ted had helped him dig for the buried treasure that  old 'Notch-ear' Beggs had told them so exactly about. Remembrance of  that episode gave Thig an idea about the little lump of jewels in his  pocket. He had found them in a chest along the beach!\n\n\n He was coming up on the porch now and at the sound of his foot on  the sagging boards the screen door burst open and three little  Earth-creatures were hugging at his legs. An odd sensation, that his  acquired memories labeled as pleasure, sent a warm glow upward from  around his heart.\n\n\n Then he saw the slender red-haired shape of a woman, the mate of the  dead man he knew, and confusion struck his well-trained brain. Men  had no mates on Ortha, sex had been overthrown with all the other  primitive impulses of barbarism; so he was incapable of understanding  the emotions that swept through his acquired memory.\n\n\n Unsteadily he took her in his arms and felt her warm lips pressed,  trembling, against his own. That same hot wave of pulsing blood choked  achingly up into his throat.\n\n\n \"Lew, dear,\" Ellen was asking, \"where have you been all day? I called  up at the landing but you were not there. I wanted to let you know that  Saddlebag Publications sent a check for $50 for \"Reversed Revolvers\"  and three other editors asked for shorts soon.\" \"Shoulda got a hundred bucks for that yarn,\" grunted Thig, and gasped.\n\n\n For the moment he had been Lewis Terry and not Thig! So thoroughly had  he acquired the knowledge of Terry that he found himself unconsciously  adopting the thinking and mannerism of the other. All the better this  way, he realized\u2014more natural.\n\n\n \"Sorry I was late,\" he said, digging into his pocket for the  glittering baubles, \"but I was poking around on the beach where we used  to hunt treasure and I found an old chest. Inside it I found nothing  but a handful of these.\"\n\n\n He flashed the jewels in front of Ellen's startled eyes and she clung,  unbelieving, to his arm.\n\n\n \"Why, Lew,\" she gasped, \"they're worth a fortune! We can buy that new  trailer now and have a rebuilt motor in the car. We can go west right  away.... Hollywood, the Grand Canyon, cowboys!\"\n\n\n \"Uh huh,\" agreed the pseudo Lewis, memories of the ferocious savages  and gunmen of his stories rendering him acutely unhappy. Sincerely he  hoped that the west had reformed.\n\n\n \"I saved some kraut and weiners,\" Ellen said. \"Get washed up while I'm  warming them up. Kids ate all the bread so I had to borrow some from  the Eskoes. Want coffee, too?\"\n\n\n \"Mmmmmm,\" came from the depths of the chipped white wash-basin. \"Home again,\" whispered Ellen as she stood beside Thig twelve weeks  later and gazed tearfully at the weathered little gray house. She knelt  beside the front stoop and reached for the key hidden beneath it.\n\n\n \"The west was wonderful; tremendous, vast and beautiful,\" she went  on as they climbed the steps, \"but nowhere was there any place as  beautiful as our own little strip of sky and water.\"\n\n\n Thig sank into a dusty old swing that hung on creaking chains from the  exposed rafters of the porch roof. He looked down at the dusty gray car  and the bulbous silvery bulk of the trailer that had been their living  quarters for almost three months. Strange thoughts were afloat in the  chaos of his cool Orthan brain.\n\n\n Tonight or tomorrow night at the latest he must contact his two fellows  and report that Earth was a planetary paradise. No other world,  including Ortha, was so well-favored and rich. An expeditionary force  to wipe the grotesque civilizations of Earth out of existence would,  of course, be necessary before the first units of new Hordes could be  landed. And there Thig balked. Why must they destroy these people,  imperfect though their civilization might be, to make room for the  Hordes?\n\n\n Thig tried to tell himself that it was the transmitted thoughts of the  dead Earthman that made him feel so, but he was not too sure. For three  months he had lived with people who loved, hated, wept and sacrificed  for reasons that he had never known existed. He had learned the heady  glory of thinking for himself and making his own decisions. He had  experienced the primitive joy of matching his wits and tongue against  the wits of other unpredictable human beings. There was no abrupt  division of men and women into definite classes of endeavor. A laborer  thought the same thoughts that a governor might think. Uncertainty  added zest to every day's life.\n\n\n The Orthan had come to question the sole devotion of the individual to  the Horde to the exclusion of all other interests. What, he wondered,  would one new world\u2014or a hundred\u2014populated by the Hordes add to  the progress of humanity? For a hundred thousand years the Orthan  civilization had remained static, its energies directed into certain  well-defined channels. They were mindless bees maintaining their vast  mechanical hives.\n\n\n There was that moment on the brink of the Grand Canyon when Ellen had  caught his arm breathlessly at all the beauty spread away there beneath  them. There were mornings in the desert when the sun painted in lurid  red the peaks above the harsh black-and-whites of the sagebrush and  cactus slopes. There was the little boy, his body burning with fever,  who nestled trustingly against his tense man's body and slept\u2014the son  of Ellen and the man he had destroyed.\n\n\n Thig groaned. He was a weakling to let sentimentality so get the better  of his judgment. He would go now to the space ship and urge them to  blast off for Ortha. He sprang off the porch and strode away down the  road toward the beach.\n\n\n The children ran to him; wanted to go along. He sent them away harshly  but they smiled and waved their brown little hands. Ellen came to the  door and called after him.\n\n\n \"Hurry home, dear,\" she said. \"I'll have a bite ready in about an hour.\"\n\n\n He dared not say anything, for his voice would have broken and she  would have known something was wrong. She was a very wise sort of  person when something was troubling him. He waved his stubby paw of a  hand to show that he had heard, and blindly hurried toward the Sound.\n\n\n Oddly enough, as he hurried away along the narrow path through the  autumn woods, his mind busied itself with a new epic of the west that  lived no longer. He mentally titled it: \"Rustlers' Riot\" and blocked  in the outlines of his plot. One section of his brain was that of the  careless author of gunslinging yarns, a section that seemed to be  sapping the life from his own brain. He knew that the story would never  be written, but he toyed with the idea.\n\n\n So far had Thig the emotionless, robot-being from Ortha drifted from  the unquestioning worship of the Horde! \"You have done well,\" announced Torp when Thig had completed his report  on the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. \"We now  have located three worlds fit for colonization and so we will return to  Ortha at once.\n\n\n \"I will recommend the conquest of this planet, 72-P-3 at once and the  complete destruction of all biped life upon it. The mental aberrations  of the barbaric natives might lead to endless complications if they  were permitted to exist outside our ordered way of life. I imagine that  three circuits of the planet about its primary should prove sufficient  for the purposes of complete liquidation.\"\n\n\n \"But why,\" asked Thig slowly, \"could we not disarm all the natives and  exile them on one of the less desirable continents, Antarctica for  example or Siberia? They are primitive humans even as our race was once  a race of primitives. It is not our duty to help to attain our own  degree of knowledge and comfort?\"\n\n\n \"Only the good of the Horde matters!\" shouted Torp angrily. \"Shall a  race of feeble-witted beasts, such as these Earthmen, stand in the way  of a superior race? We want their world, and so we will take it. The  Law of the Horde states that all the universe is ours for the taking.\"\n\n\n \"Let us get back to Ortha at once, then,\" gritted out Thig savagely.  \"Never again do I wish to set foot upon the soil of this mad planet.  There are forces at work upon Earth that we of Ortha have long  forgotten.\"\n\n\n \"Check the blood of Thig for disease, Kam,\" ordered Torp shortly. \"His  words are highly irrational. Some form of fever perhaps native to this  world. While you examine him I will blast off for Ortha.\"\n\n\n Thig followed Kam into the tiny laboratory and found a seat beside the  squat scientist's desk. His eyes roamed over the familiar instruments  and gauges, each in its own precise position in the cases along the  walls. His gaze lingered longest on the stubby black ugliness of  a decomposition blaster in its rack close to the deck. A blast of  the invisible radiations from that weapon's hot throat and flesh or  vegetable fiber rotted into flaky ashes.\n\n\n The ship trembled beneath their feet; it tore free from the feeble  clutch of the sand about it, and they were rocketing skyward. Thig's  broad fingers bit deep into the unyielding metal of his chair. Suddenly  he knew that he must go back to Earth, back to Ellen and the children  of the man he had helped destroy. He loved Ellen, and nothing must  stand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, an  empty world\u2014this planet was not for them.\n\n\n \"Turn back!\" he cried wildly. \"I must go back to Earth. There is a  woman there, helpless and alone, who needs me! The Horde does not need  this planet.\"\n\n\n Kam eyed him coldly and lifted a shining hypodermic syringe from its  case. He approached Thig warily, aware that disease often made a maniac  of the finest members of the Horde.\n\n\n \"No human being is more important than the Horde,\" he stated baldly.  \"This woman of whom you speak is merely one unit of the millions we  must eliminate for the good of the Horde.\"\n\n\n Then it was that Thig went berserk. His fists slashed into the thick  jaw of the scientist and his fingers ripped at the hard cords overlying  the Orthan's vital throat tubes. His fingers and thumb gouged deep into  Kam's startled throat and choked off any cry for assistance before it  could be uttered.\n\n\n Kam's hand swept down to the holster swung from his intricate harness  and dragged his blaster from it. Thig's other hand clamped over his and  for long moments they swayed there, locked together in silent deadly  struggle. The fate of a world hung in the balance as Kam's other hand  fought against that lone arm of Thig. The scales swung in favor of Kam. Slowly the flaring snout of his  weapon tilted upward until it reached the level of Thig's waist. Thig  suddenly released his grip and dragged his enemy toward him. A sudden  reversal of pressure on Kam's gun hand sent the weapon swivelling  about full upon its owner's thick torso. Thig's fingers pressed down  upon Kam's button finger, down upon the stud set into the grip of the  decomposition blaster, and Kam's muscles turned to water. He shrieked.\n\n\n Before Thig's eyes half of his comrade's body sloughed away into foul  corruption that swiftly gave way to hardened blobs of dessicated  matter. Horror for what he had done\u2014that he had slain one of his own  Horde\u2014made his limbs move woodenly. All of his thoughts were dulled  for the moment. Painfully slow, he turned his body around toward the  control blister, turned around on leaden feet, to look full into the  narrowed icy eyes of his commander.\n\n\n He saw the heavy barrel of the blaster slashing down against his  skull but he could not swing a fraction of an inch out of the way.  His body seemed paralyzed. This was the end, he thought as he waited  stupidly for the blow to fall, the end for Ellen and the kids and all  the struggling races of Earth. He would never write another cowboy  yarn\u2014they would all be dead anyhow soon.\n\n\n Then a thunderclap exploded against his head and he dropped endlessly  toward the deck. Blows rained against his skull. He wondered if Torp  would ever cease to hammer at him and turn the deadly ray of the weapon  upon him. Blood throbbed and pounded with every blow.... Bam, Bam, Bam, the blood pounded in his ears. Like repeated blows of a  hammer they shook his booming head. No longer was Torp above him. He  was in the corner of the laboratory, a crumpled blood-smeared heap of  bruised flesh and bone. He was unfettered and the blood was caked upon  his skull and in his matted hair. Torp must have thought he had killed  him with those savage blows upon the head.\n\n\n Even Torp, thought Thig ruefully, gave way to the primitive rage of his  ancestors at times; but to that very bit of unconscious atavism he now  owed his life. A cool-headed robot of an Orthan would have efficiently  used the blaster to destroy any possibility of remaining life in his  unconscious body.\n\n\n Thig rolled slowly over so that his eye found the door into the control  room. Torp would be coming back again to dispose of their bodies  through the refuse lock. Already the body of Kam was gone. He wondered  why he had been left until last. Perhaps Torp wished to take cultures  of his blood and tissues to determine whether a disease was responsible  for his sudden madness.\n\n\n The cases of fragile instruments were just above his head. Association  of memories brought him the flash of the heavy blaster in its rack  beneath them. His hand went up and felt the welcome hardness of the  weapon. He tugged it free.\n\n\n In a moment he was on his knees crawling across the plates of the deck  toward the door. Halfway across the floor he collapsed on his face,  the metal of the gun making a harsh clang. He heard the feet of Torp  scuffle out of silence and a choked cry in the man's throat squalled  out into a senseless whinny.\n\n\n Thig raised himself up on a quivering elbow and slid the black length  of the blaster in front of him. His eyes sought the doorway and stared  full into the glaring vacant orbs of his commander. Torp leaned there  watching him, his breath gurgling brokenly through his deep-bitten  lips. The clawing marks of nails, fingernails, furrowed his face and  chest. He was a madman!\n\n\n The deadly attack of Thig; his own violent avenging of Kam's death, and  now the apparent return of the man he had killed come to life had all  served to jolt his rigidly trained brain from its accustomed groove.  The shock had been too much for the established thought-processes of  the Orthan.\n\n\n So Thig shot him where he stood, mercifully, before that vacant mad  stare set him, too, to gibbering and shrieking. Then he stepped over  the skeleton-thing that had been Torp, using the new strength that  victory had given him to drive him along.\n\n\n He had saved a world's civilization from extinction! The thought  sobered him; yet, somehow, he was pleased that he had done so. After  all, it had been the Earthwoman and the children he had been thinking  of while he battled Kam, a selfish desire to protect them all.\n\n\n He went to the desk where Torp had been writing in the ship's log and  read the last few nervously scrawled lines: Planet 72-P-3 unfit for colonization. Some pernicious disease that  strikes at the brain centers and causes violent insanity is existent  there. Thig, just returned from a survey of the planet, went mad and  destroyed Kam. In turn I was forced to slay him. But it is not ended.  Already I feel the insidious virus of.... And there his writing ended abruptly.\n\n\n Thig nodded. That would do it. He set the automatic pilot for the  planet Ortha. Unless a rogue asteroid or a comet crossed the ship's  path she would return safely to Ortha with that mute warning of danger  on 72-P-3. The body of Torp would help to confirm his final message.\n\n\n Then Thig crossed the cabin to the auxiliary life boat there, one of  a half-dozen space ships in miniature nested within the great ship's  hull, and cut free from the mother vessel.\n\n\n He flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the rockets driving  him from the parent ship. The sensation of free flight against his new  body was strangely exhilerating and heady. It was the newest of the  emotions he had experienced on Earth since that day, so many months  before, when he had felt the warmness of Ellen's lips tight against his. Thig flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the  rockets driving him from the parent ship. He swung about to the port, watched the flaming drive-rockets of the  great exploratory ship hurl it toward far-away Ortha, and there was no  regret in his mind that he was not returning to the planet of his first  existence.\n\n\n He thought of the dull greys and blacks of his planet, of the  monotonous routine of existence that had once been his\u2014and his heart  thrilled to the memories of the starry nights and perfect exciting days  he had spent on his three month trip over Earth.\n\n\n He made a brief salute to the existence he had known, turned with a  tiny sigh, and his fingers made brief adjustments in the controls. The  rocket-thrum deepened, and the thin whistle of tenuous air clutching  the ship echoed through the hull-plates.\n\n\n He thought of many things in those few moments. He watched the  roundness of Earth flatten out, then take on the cup-like illusion  that all planets had for an incoming ship. He reduced the drive of his  rockets to a mere whisper, striving to control the impatience that  crowded his mind.\n\n\n He shivered suddenly, remembering his utter callousness the first time  he had sent a space ship whipping down toward the hills and valleys  below. And there was a sickness within him when he fully realized that,  despite his acquired memory and traits, he was an alien from outer  space.\n\n\n He fingered the tiny scars that had completely obliterated the slight  differences in his appearance from an Earthman's, and his fingers  trembled a bit, as he bent and stared through the vision port. He said  a brief prayer in his heart to a God whose presence he now felt very  deeply. There were tears in the depths of his eyes, then, and memories  were hot, bitter pains. Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he  heaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's  creation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the  West. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and  now, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n\n\n The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be  a knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her  dreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n\n\n The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines  of Long Island in the growing twilight.\n\n\n A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a  cowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.  He had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about  them....\n\n\n He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that! \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Torp and Kam plan to do while Thig was posing as Lewis?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Scout out the other two inner planets\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Wait in the ship for the next call to action\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Wait in the ship for the next call to action\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Wait in the ship for the next call to action\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He looked out across the  heaving waters of the Sound toward Connecticut. He stared appraisingly  around at the luxuriant green growth of foliage further inland; and  started toward the little stretch of trees and brush, walking carefully  because of the lesser gravitation.\n\n\n Thig was shorter than the average Earthman\u2014although on Ortha he  was well above the average in height\u2014but his body was thick and  powerfully muscled. His skull was well-shaped and large; his features  were regular, perhaps a trifle oversize, and his hair and eyes were  a curiously matching blend of reddish brown. Oddest of all, he wore  no garments, other than the necessary belt and straps to support his  rod-like weapon of white metal and his pouches for food and specimens.\n\n\n The Orthan entered the narrow strip of trees and crossed to the  little-used highway on the other side. Here he patiently sat down to  wait for an Earthman or an Earthwoman to pass. His task now was to  bring a native, intact if possible, back to the carefully buried space  cruiser where his two fellows and himself would drain the creature's  mentality of all its knowledge. In this way they could learn whether a  planet was suited for colonization by later swarms of Orthans.\n\n\n Already they had charted over a hundred celestial bodies but of them  all only three had proven worthy of consideration. This latest planet,  however, 72-P-3 on the chart, appeared to be an ideal world in every  respect. Sunlight, plenty of water and a dense atmospheric envelope  made of 72-P-3 a paradise among planets.\n\n\n The explorer from another world crouched into the concealment of a  leafy shrub. A creature was approaching. Its squat body was covered  with baggy strips of bluish cloth and it carried a jointed rod of metal  and wood in its paw. It walked upright as did the men of Ortha.\n\n\n Thig's cold eyes opened a trifle wider as he stared into the thing's  stupid face. It was as though he was looking into a bit of polished  metal at the reflection of himself!\n\n\n The Earthman was opposite now and he must waste no more precious  time. The mighty muscles of the Orthan sent him hurtling across the  intervening space in two prodigious bounds, and his hands clamped  across the mouth and neck of the stranger.... Lewis Terry was going fishing. For a week the typewriter mill that had  ground out a thousand assorted yarns of the untamed West and the frigid  desolation of the Northwoods had been silent. Lewis wondered if he was  going stale. He had sat every day for eight hours in front of that  shiny-buttoned bane of the typist, but there were no results. Feebly  he had punched a key two days ago and a $ sign had appeared. He hadn't  dared touch the machine since.\n\n\n For Mr. Terry, that hard-hitting writer of two-gun action, had never  been further west of Long Island than Elizabeth, and he had promised  his wife, Ellen, that he would take the three children and herself on  a trailer tour of the West that very summer. Since that promise, he  could not write a word. Visions of whooping red-skinned Apaches and  be-chapped outlaws raiding his little trailer home kept rolling up out  of his subconscious. Yet he had to write at least three novelets and  a fistful of short stories in the next two weeks to finance the great  adventure\u2014or the trip was off.\n\n\n So Lewis left the weathered old cottage in the early dawn and headed  for his tubby old boat at the landing in an attempt to work out a  salable yarn....\n\n\n \"Hey!\" he shouted as a naked man sprang out of the bushes beside the  road. \"What's the trouble?\"\n\n\n Then he had no time for further speech, the massive arms of the  stranger had wound around him and two hamlike hands shut off his speech  and his wind. He fought futilely against trained muscles. The hand  clamping his throat relaxed for a moment and hacked along the side of  his head. Blackness flooded the brain of Lewis, and he knew no more. \"There it is,\" announced Thig, dropping the limp body of the captured  Earthman to the metal deck-plates. \"It is a male of the species that  must have built the cities we saw as we landed.\"\n\n\n \"He resembles Thig,\" announced Kam. \"But for the strange covering he  wears he might be Thig.\"\n\n\n \"Thig will be this creature!\" announced Torp. \"With a psychic relay we  will transfer the Earthman's memories and meager store of knowledge to  the brain of Thig! He can then go out and scout this world without  arousing suspicion. While he is gone, I will take Kam and explore the  two inner planets.\"\n\n\n \"You are the commander,\" said Thig. \"But I wish this beast did not wear  these clumsy sheathing upon his body. On Ortha we do not hamper the use  of our limbs so.\"\n\n\n \"Do not question the word of your commander,\" growled Torp, swelling  out his thick chest menacingly. \"It is for the good of our people that  you disguise yourself as an Earthman.\"\n\n\n \"For the good of the Horde,\" Thig intoned almost piously as he lifted  Terry's body and headed for the laboratory.\n\n\n Service for the Horde was all that the men of Ortha knew. Carefully  cultured and brought to life in the laboratories of their Horde, they  knew neither father nor mother. Affection and love were entirely  lacking in their early training and later life. They were trained  antlike from childhood that only the growth and power of the Horde  were of any moment. Men and women alike toiled and died like unfeeling  robots of flesh and bone for the Horde. The Horde was their religion,  their love-life, their everything!\n\n\n So it was that the bodies of the Earthman and the Orthan were strapped  on two parallel tables of chill metal and the twin helmets, linked to  one another by the intricacies of the psychic relay, put upon their  heads.\n\n\n For ten hours or more the droning hum of the relay sucked Terry's brain  dry of knowledge. The shock upon the nervous system of the Earthman  proved too violent and his heart faltered after a time and stopped  completely. Twice, with subtle drugs they restored pseudo-life to his  body and kept the electrical impulses throbbing from his tortured  brain, but after the third suspension of life Thig removed his helmet.\n\n\n \"There is nothing more to learn,\" he informed his impassive comrades.  \"Now, let us get on with the plastic surgery that is required. My new  body must return to its barbaric household before undue attention is  aroused. And when I return I will take along some of the gleaming  baubles we found on the red planet\u2014these people value them highly.\"\n\n\n An hour later, his scars and altered cartilage already healed and  painless, Thig again scraped sand over the entrance to the space ship  and set out along the moonlit beach toward the nearest path running  inland to his home.\n\n\n Memory was laying the country bare about him, Terry's own childhood  memories of this particular section of Long Island. Here was the place  where Jake and Ted had helped him dig for the buried treasure that  old 'Notch-ear' Beggs had told them so exactly about. Remembrance of  that episode gave Thig an idea about the little lump of jewels in his  pocket. He had found them in a chest along the beach!\n\n\n He was coming up on the porch now and at the sound of his foot on  the sagging boards the screen door burst open and three little  Earth-creatures were hugging at his legs. An odd sensation, that his  acquired memories labeled as pleasure, sent a warm glow upward from  around his heart.\n\n\n Then he saw the slender red-haired shape of a woman, the mate of the  dead man he knew, and confusion struck his well-trained brain. Men  had no mates on Ortha, sex had been overthrown with all the other  primitive impulses of barbarism; so he was incapable of understanding  the emotions that swept through his acquired memory.\n\n\n Unsteadily he took her in his arms and felt her warm lips pressed,  trembling, against his own. That same hot wave of pulsing blood choked  achingly up into his throat.\n\n\n \"Lew, dear,\" Ellen was asking, \"where have you been all day? I called  up at the landing but you were not there. I wanted to let you know that  Saddlebag Publications sent a check for $50 for \"Reversed Revolvers\"  and three other editors asked for shorts soon.\" \"Shoulda got a hundred bucks for that yarn,\" grunted Thig, and gasped.\n\n\n For the moment he had been Lewis Terry and not Thig! So thoroughly had  he acquired the knowledge of Terry that he found himself unconsciously  adopting the thinking and mannerism of the other. All the better this  way, he realized\u2014more natural.\n\n\n \"Sorry I was late,\" he said, digging into his pocket for the  glittering baubles, \"but I was poking around on the beach where we used  to hunt treasure and I found an old chest. Inside it I found nothing  but a handful of these.\"\n\n\n He flashed the jewels in front of Ellen's startled eyes and she clung,  unbelieving, to his arm.\n\n\n \"Why, Lew,\" she gasped, \"they're worth a fortune! We can buy that new  trailer now and have a rebuilt motor in the car. We can go west right  away.... Hollywood, the Grand Canyon, cowboys!\"\n\n\n \"Uh huh,\" agreed the pseudo Lewis, memories of the ferocious savages  and gunmen of his stories rendering him acutely unhappy. Sincerely he  hoped that the west had reformed.\n\n\n \"I saved some kraut and weiners,\" Ellen said. \"Get washed up while I'm  warming them up. Kids ate all the bread so I had to borrow some from  the Eskoes. Want coffee, too?\"\n\n\n \"Mmmmmm,\" came from the depths of the chipped white wash-basin. \"Home again,\" whispered Ellen as she stood beside Thig twelve weeks  later and gazed tearfully at the weathered little gray house. She knelt  beside the front stoop and reached for the key hidden beneath it.\n\n\n \"The west was wonderful; tremendous, vast and beautiful,\" she went  on as they climbed the steps, \"but nowhere was there any place as  beautiful as our own little strip of sky and water.\"\n\n\n Thig sank into a dusty old swing that hung on creaking chains from the  exposed rafters of the porch roof. He looked down at the dusty gray car  and the bulbous silvery bulk of the trailer that had been their living  quarters for almost three months. Strange thoughts were afloat in the  chaos of his cool Orthan brain.\n\n\n Tonight or tomorrow night at the latest he must contact his two fellows  and report that Earth was a planetary paradise. No other world,  including Ortha, was so well-favored and rich. An expeditionary force  to wipe the grotesque civilizations of Earth out of existence would,  of course, be necessary before the first units of new Hordes could be  landed. And there Thig balked. Why must they destroy these people,  imperfect though their civilization might be, to make room for the  Hordes?\n\n\n Thig tried to tell himself that it was the transmitted thoughts of the  dead Earthman that made him feel so, but he was not too sure. For three  months he had lived with people who loved, hated, wept and sacrificed  for reasons that he had never known existed. He had learned the heady  glory of thinking for himself and making his own decisions. He had  experienced the primitive joy of matching his wits and tongue against  the wits of other unpredictable human beings. There was no abrupt  division of men and women into definite classes of endeavor. A laborer  thought the same thoughts that a governor might think. Uncertainty  added zest to every day's life.\n\n\n The Orthan had come to question the sole devotion of the individual to  the Horde to the exclusion of all other interests. What, he wondered,  would one new world\u2014or a hundred\u2014populated by the Hordes add to  the progress of humanity? For a hundred thousand years the Orthan  civilization had remained static, its energies directed into certain  well-defined channels. They were mindless bees maintaining their vast  mechanical hives.\n\n\n There was that moment on the brink of the Grand Canyon when Ellen had  caught his arm breathlessly at all the beauty spread away there beneath  them. There were mornings in the desert when the sun painted in lurid  red the peaks above the harsh black-and-whites of the sagebrush and  cactus slopes. There was the little boy, his body burning with fever,  who nestled trustingly against his tense man's body and slept\u2014the son  of Ellen and the man he had destroyed.\n\n\n Thig groaned. He was a weakling to let sentimentality so get the better  of his judgment. He would go now to the space ship and urge them to  blast off for Ortha. He sprang off the porch and strode away down the  road toward the beach.\n\n\n The children ran to him; wanted to go along. He sent them away harshly  but they smiled and waved their brown little hands. Ellen came to the  door and called after him.\n\n\n \"Hurry home, dear,\" she said. \"I'll have a bite ready in about an hour.\"\n\n\n He dared not say anything, for his voice would have broken and she  would have known something was wrong. She was a very wise sort of  person when something was troubling him. He waved his stubby paw of a  hand to show that he had heard, and blindly hurried toward the Sound.\n\n\n Oddly enough, as he hurried away along the narrow path through the  autumn woods, his mind busied itself with a new epic of the west that  lived no longer. He mentally titled it: \"Rustlers' Riot\" and blocked  in the outlines of his plot. One section of his brain was that of the  careless author of gunslinging yarns, a section that seemed to be  sapping the life from his own brain. He knew that the story would never  be written, but he toyed with the idea.\n\n\n So far had Thig the emotionless, robot-being from Ortha drifted from  the unquestioning worship of the Horde! \"You have done well,\" announced Torp when Thig had completed his report  on the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. \"We now  have located three worlds fit for colonization and so we will return to  Ortha at once.\n\n\n \"I will recommend the conquest of this planet, 72-P-3 at once and the  complete destruction of all biped life upon it. The mental aberrations  of the barbaric natives might lead to endless complications if they  were permitted to exist outside our ordered way of life. I imagine that  three circuits of the planet about its primary should prove sufficient  for the purposes of complete liquidation.\"\n\n\n \"But why,\" asked Thig slowly, \"could we not disarm all the natives and  exile them on one of the less desirable continents, Antarctica for  example or Siberia? They are primitive humans even as our race was once  a race of primitives. It is not our duty to help to attain our own  degree of knowledge and comfort?\"\n\n\n \"Only the good of the Horde matters!\" shouted Torp angrily. \"Shall a  race of feeble-witted beasts, such as these Earthmen, stand in the way  of a superior race? We want their world, and so we will take it. The  Law of the Horde states that all the universe is ours for the taking.\"\n\n\n \"Let us get back to Ortha at once, then,\" gritted out Thig savagely.  \"Never again do I wish to set foot upon the soil of this mad planet.  There are forces at work upon Earth that we of Ortha have long  forgotten.\"\n\n\n \"Check the blood of Thig for disease, Kam,\" ordered Torp shortly. \"His  words are highly irrational. Some form of fever perhaps native to this  world. While you examine him I will blast off for Ortha.\"\n\n\n Thig followed Kam into the tiny laboratory and found a seat beside the  squat scientist's desk. His eyes roamed over the familiar instruments  and gauges, each in its own precise position in the cases along the  walls. His gaze lingered longest on the stubby black ugliness of  a decomposition blaster in its rack close to the deck. A blast of  the invisible radiations from that weapon's hot throat and flesh or  vegetable fiber rotted into flaky ashes.\n\n\n The ship trembled beneath their feet; it tore free from the feeble  clutch of the sand about it, and they were rocketing skyward. Thig's  broad fingers bit deep into the unyielding metal of his chair. Suddenly  he knew that he must go back to Earth, back to Ellen and the children  of the man he had helped destroy. He loved Ellen, and nothing must  stand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, an  empty world\u2014this planet was not for them.\n\n\n \"Turn back!\" he cried wildly. \"I must go back to Earth. There is a  woman there, helpless and alone, who needs me! The Horde does not need  this planet.\"\n\n\n Kam eyed him coldly and lifted a shining hypodermic syringe from its  case. He approached Thig warily, aware that disease often made a maniac  of the finest members of the Horde.\n\n\n \"No human being is more important than the Horde,\" he stated baldly.  \"This woman of whom you speak is merely one unit of the millions we  must eliminate for the good of the Horde.\"\n\n\n Then it was that Thig went berserk. His fists slashed into the thick  jaw of the scientist and his fingers ripped at the hard cords overlying  the Orthan's vital throat tubes. His fingers and thumb gouged deep into  Kam's startled throat and choked off any cry for assistance before it  could be uttered.\n\n\n Kam's hand swept down to the holster swung from his intricate harness  and dragged his blaster from it. Thig's other hand clamped over his and  for long moments they swayed there, locked together in silent deadly  struggle. The fate of a world hung in the balance as Kam's other hand  fought against that lone arm of Thig. The scales swung in favor of Kam. Slowly the flaring snout of his  weapon tilted upward until it reached the level of Thig's waist. Thig  suddenly released his grip and dragged his enemy toward him. A sudden  reversal of pressure on Kam's gun hand sent the weapon swivelling  about full upon its owner's thick torso. Thig's fingers pressed down  upon Kam's button finger, down upon the stud set into the grip of the  decomposition blaster, and Kam's muscles turned to water. He shrieked.\n\n\n Before Thig's eyes half of his comrade's body sloughed away into foul  corruption that swiftly gave way to hardened blobs of dessicated  matter. Horror for what he had done\u2014that he had slain one of his own  Horde\u2014made his limbs move woodenly. All of his thoughts were dulled  for the moment. Painfully slow, he turned his body around toward the  control blister, turned around on leaden feet, to look full into the  narrowed icy eyes of his commander.\n\n\n He saw the heavy barrel of the blaster slashing down against his  skull but he could not swing a fraction of an inch out of the way.  His body seemed paralyzed. This was the end, he thought as he waited  stupidly for the blow to fall, the end for Ellen and the kids and all  the struggling races of Earth. He would never write another cowboy  yarn\u2014they would all be dead anyhow soon.\n\n\n Then a thunderclap exploded against his head and he dropped endlessly  toward the deck. Blows rained against his skull. He wondered if Torp  would ever cease to hammer at him and turn the deadly ray of the weapon  upon him. Blood throbbed and pounded with every blow.... Bam, Bam, Bam, the blood pounded in his ears. Like repeated blows of a  hammer they shook his booming head. No longer was Torp above him. He  was in the corner of the laboratory, a crumpled blood-smeared heap of  bruised flesh and bone. He was unfettered and the blood was caked upon  his skull and in his matted hair. Torp must have thought he had killed  him with those savage blows upon the head.\n\n\n Even Torp, thought Thig ruefully, gave way to the primitive rage of his  ancestors at times; but to that very bit of unconscious atavism he now  owed his life. A cool-headed robot of an Orthan would have efficiently  used the blaster to destroy any possibility of remaining life in his  unconscious body.\n\n\n Thig rolled slowly over so that his eye found the door into the control  room. Torp would be coming back again to dispose of their bodies  through the refuse lock. Already the body of Kam was gone. He wondered  why he had been left until last. Perhaps Torp wished to take cultures  of his blood and tissues to determine whether a disease was responsible  for his sudden madness.\n\n\n The cases of fragile instruments were just above his head. Association  of memories brought him the flash of the heavy blaster in its rack  beneath them. His hand went up and felt the welcome hardness of the  weapon. He tugged it free.\n\n\n In a moment he was on his knees crawling across the plates of the deck  toward the door. Halfway across the floor he collapsed on his face,  the metal of the gun making a harsh clang. He heard the feet of Torp  scuffle out of silence and a choked cry in the man's throat squalled  out into a senseless whinny.\n\n\n Thig raised himself up on a quivering elbow and slid the black length  of the blaster in front of him. His eyes sought the doorway and stared  full into the glaring vacant orbs of his commander. Torp leaned there  watching him, his breath gurgling brokenly through his deep-bitten  lips. The clawing marks of nails, fingernails, furrowed his face and  chest. He was a madman!\n\n\n The deadly attack of Thig; his own violent avenging of Kam's death, and  now the apparent return of the man he had killed come to life had all  served to jolt his rigidly trained brain from its accustomed groove.  The shock had been too much for the established thought-processes of  the Orthan.\n\n\n So Thig shot him where he stood, mercifully, before that vacant mad  stare set him, too, to gibbering and shrieking. Then he stepped over  the skeleton-thing that had been Torp, using the new strength that  victory had given him to drive him along.\n\n\n He had saved a world's civilization from extinction! The thought  sobered him; yet, somehow, he was pleased that he had done so. After  all, it had been the Earthwoman and the children he had been thinking  of while he battled Kam, a selfish desire to protect them all.\n\n\n He went to the desk where Torp had been writing in the ship's log and  read the last few nervously scrawled lines: Planet 72-P-3 unfit for colonization. Some pernicious disease that  strikes at the brain centers and causes violent insanity is existent  there. Thig, just returned from a survey of the planet, went mad and  destroyed Kam. In turn I was forced to slay him. But it is not ended.  Already I feel the insidious virus of.... And there his writing ended abruptly.\n\n\n Thig nodded. That would do it. He set the automatic pilot for the  planet Ortha. Unless a rogue asteroid or a comet crossed the ship's  path she would return safely to Ortha with that mute warning of danger  on 72-P-3. The body of Torp would help to confirm his final message.\n\n\n Then Thig crossed the cabin to the auxiliary life boat there, one of  a half-dozen space ships in miniature nested within the great ship's  hull, and cut free from the mother vessel.\n\n\n He flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the rockets driving  him from the parent ship. The sensation of free flight against his new  body was strangely exhilerating and heady. It was the newest of the  emotions he had experienced on Earth since that day, so many months  before, when he had felt the warmness of Ellen's lips tight against his. Thig flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the  rockets driving him from the parent ship. He swung about to the port, watched the flaming drive-rockets of the  great exploratory ship hurl it toward far-away Ortha, and there was no  regret in his mind that he was not returning to the planet of his first  existence.\n\n\n He thought of the dull greys and blacks of his planet, of the  monotonous routine of existence that had once been his\u2014and his heart  thrilled to the memories of the starry nights and perfect exciting days  he had spent on his three month trip over Earth.\n\n\n He made a brief salute to the existence he had known, turned with a  tiny sigh, and his fingers made brief adjustments in the controls. The  rocket-thrum deepened, and the thin whistle of tenuous air clutching  the ship echoed through the hull-plates.\n\n\n He thought of many things in those few moments. He watched the  roundness of Earth flatten out, then take on the cup-like illusion  that all planets had for an incoming ship. He reduced the drive of his  rockets to a mere whisper, striving to control the impatience that  crowded his mind.\n\n\n He shivered suddenly, remembering his utter callousness the first time  he had sent a space ship whipping down toward the hills and valleys  below. And there was a sickness within him when he fully realized that,  despite his acquired memory and traits, he was an alien from outer  space.\n\n\n He fingered the tiny scars that had completely obliterated the slight  differences in his appearance from an Earthman's, and his fingers  trembled a bit, as he bent and stared through the vision port. He said  a brief prayer in his heart to a God whose presence he now felt very  deeply. There were tears in the depths of his eyes, then, and memories  were hot, bitter pains. Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he  heaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's  creation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the  West. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and  now, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n\n\n The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be  a knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her  dreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n\n\n The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines  of Long Island in the growing twilight.\n\n\n A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a  cowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.  He had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about  them....\n\n\n He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that! \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Torp and Kam plan to do while Thig was posing as Lewis?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Scout out the other two inner planets\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Wait in the ship for the next call to action\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Wait in the ship for the next call to action\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Wait in the ship for the next call to action\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
