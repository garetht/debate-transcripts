NOURSE [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, August 1957.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There was a man in our town, and he was wondrous wise; He jumped into a bramble bush and scratched out both his eyes. And when he saw what he had done, with all his might and main He jumped into another bush and scratched them in again. MOTHER GOOSE Dr. David Lessing found Jack Dorffman and the boy waiting in his office  when he arrived at the Hoffman Center that morning. Dorffman looked as  though he'd been running all night. There were dark pouches under his  eyes; his heavy unshaven face seemed to sag at every crease. Lessing  glanced sharply at his Field Director and sank down behind his desk  with a sigh. \"All right, Jack\u2014what's wrong?\"\n\n\n \"This kid is driving me nuts,\" said Dorffman through clenched teeth.  \"He's gone completely hay-wire. Nobody's been able to get near him  for three weeks, and now at six o'clock this morning he decides he's  leaving the Farm. I talk to him, I sweat him down, I do everything but  tie him to the bed, and I waste my time. He's leaving the Farm. Period.\"\n\n\n \"So you bring him down here,\" said Lessing sourly. \"The worst place he  could be, if something's really wrong.\" He looked across at the boy.  \"Tommy? Come over and sit down.\"\n\n\n There was nothing singular about the boy's appearance. He was thin,  with a pale freckled face and the guileless expression of any normal  eight-year-old as he blinked across the desk at Lessing. The awkward  grey monitor-helmet concealed a shock of sandy hair. He sat with a mute  appeal in his large grey eyes as Lessing flipped the reader-switch and  blinked in alarm at the wildly thrashing pattern on the tape.\n\n\n The boy was terrorized. He was literally pulsating with fear.\n\n\n Lessing sat back slowly. \"Tell me about it, Tommy,\" he said gently.\n\n\n \"I don't want to go back to the Farm,\" said the boy.\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"I just don't. I hate it there.\"\n\n\n \"Are you frightened?\"\n\n\n The boy bit his lip and nodded slowly.\n\n\n \"Of me? Of Dr. Dorffman?\"\n\n\n \"No. Oh, no!\"\n\n\n \"Then what?\"\n\n\n Again the mute appeal in the boy's eyes. He groped for words, and none  came. Finally he said, \"If I could only take this off\u2014\" He fingered  the grey plastic helmet.\n\n\n \"You think that would make you feel better?\"\n\n\n \"It would, I know it would.\"\n\n\n Lessing shook his head. \"I don't think so, Tommy. You know what the  monitor is for, don't you?\"\n\n\n \"It stops things from going out.\"\n\n\n \"That's right. And it stops things from going in. It's an insulator.  You need it badly. It would hurt you a great deal if you took it off,  away from the Farm.\"\n\n\n The boy fought back tears. \"But I don't want to go back there\u2014\" The  fear-pattern was alive again on the tape. \"I don't feel good there. I  never want to go back.\"\n\n\n \"Well, we'll see. You can stay here for a while.\" Lessing nodded at  Dorffman and stepped into an adjoining room with him. \"You say this has  been going on for three weeks ?\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid so. We thought it was just a temporary pattern\u2014we see so  much of that up there.\"\n\n\n \"I know, I know.\" Lessing chewed his lip. \"I don't like it. We'd better  set up a battery on him and try to spot the trouble. And I'm afraid  you'll have to set it up. I've got that young Melrose from Chicago to  deal with this morning\u2014the one who's threatening to upset the whole  Conference next month with some crazy theories he's been playing with.  I'll probably have to take him out to the Farm to shut him up.\" Lessing  ran a hand through sparse grey hair. \"See what you can do for the boy  downstairs.\"\n\n\n \"Full psi precautions?\" asked Dorffman.\n\n\n \"Certainly! And Jack\u2014in this case, be sure of it. If Tommy's in the  trouble I think he's in, we don't dare risk a chance of Adult Contact  now. We could end up with a dead boy on our hands.\" Two letters were waiting on Lessing's desk that morning. The first was  from Roberts Bros., announcing another shift of deadline on the book,  and demanding the galley proofs two weeks earlier than scheduled.  Lessing groaned. As director of psionic research at the Hoffman Medical  Center, he had long since learned how administrative detail could suck  up daytime hours. He knew that his real work was at the Farm\u2014yet he  hadn't even been to the Farm in over six weeks. And now, as the book  approached publication date, Lessing wondered if he would ever really  get back to work again.\n\n\n The other letter cheered him a bit more. It bore the letterhead of the  International Psionics Conference:\n\n\n Dear Dr. Lessing:\n\n\n In recognition of your position as an authority on human Psionic  behavior patterns, we would be gratified to schedule you as principle  speaker at the Conference in Chicago on October 12th. A few remarks in  discussion of your forthcoming book would be entirely in order\u2014\n\n\n They were waiting for it, then! He ran the galley proofs into the  scanner excitedly. They knew he had something up his sleeve. His  earlier papers had only hinted at the direction he was going\u2014but the  book would clear away the fog. He scanned the title page proudly. \"A  Theory of Psionic Influence on Infant and Child Development.\" A good  title\u2014concise, commanding, yet modest. They would read it, all right.  And they would find it a light shining brightly in the darkness, a  guide to the men who were floundering in the jungle of a strange and  baffling new science.\n\n\n For they were floundering. When they were finally forced to recognize  that this great and powerful force did indeed exist in human minds,  with unimaginable potential if it could only be unlocked, they had  plunged eagerly into the search, and found themselves in a maddening  bramble bush of contradictions and chaos. Nothing worked, and  everything worked too well. They were trying to study phenomena which  made no sense, observing things that defied logic. Natural laws came  crashing down about their ears as they stood sadly by and watched  things happen which natural law said could never happen. They had never  been in this jungle before, nor in any jungle remotely like it. The  old rules didn't work here, the old methods of study failed. And the  more they struggled, the thicker and more impenetrable the bramble bush  became\u2014\n\n\n But now David Lessing had discovered a pathway through that jungle, a  theory to work by\u2014\n\n\n At his elbow the intercom buzzed. \"A gentleman to see you,\" the girl  said. \"A Dr. Melrose. He's very impatient, sir.\"\n\n\n He shut off the scanner and said, \"Send him in, please.\" Dr. Peter Melrose was tall and thin, with jet black hair and dark  mocking eyes. He wore a threadbare sport coat and a slouch. He offered  Lessing a bony hand, then flung himself into a chair as he stared about  the office in awe.\n\n\n \"I'm really overwhelmed,\" he said after a moment. \"Within the  stronghold of psionic research at last. And face to face with the  Master in the trembling flesh!\"\n\n\n Lessing frowned. \"Dr. Melrose, I don't quite understand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it's just that I'm impressed,\" the young man said airily. \"Of  course, I've seen old dried-up Authorities before\u2014but never before  a brand spanking new one, just fresh out of the pupa, so to speak!\"  He touched his forehead in a gesture of reverence. \"I bow before the  Oracle. Speak, oh Motah, live forever! Cast a pearl at my feet!\"\n\n\n \"If you've come here to be insulting,\" Lessing said coldly, \"you're  just wasting time.\" He reached for the intercom switch.\n\n\n \"I think you'd better wait before you do that,\" Melrose said sharply,  \"because I'm planning to take you apart at the Conference next month  unless I like everything I see and hear down here today. And if you  don't think I can do it, you're in for quite a dumping.\"\n\n\n Lessing sat back slowly. \"Tell me\u2014just what, exactly, do you want?\"\n\n\n \"I want to hear this fairy tale you're about to publish in the name of  'Theory',\" Melrose said. \"I want to see this famous Farm of yours up in  Connecticut and see for myself how much pressure these experimental  controls you keep talking about will actually bear. But mostly, I want  to see just what in psionic hell you're so busy making yourself an  Authority about.\" There was no laughter in the man's sharp brown eyes.\n\n\n \"You couldn't touch me with a ten foot pole at this conference,\"  snapped Lessing.\n\n\n The other man grinned. \"Try me! We shook you up a little bit last year,  but you didn't seem to get the idea.\"\n\n\n \"Last year was different.\" Lessing scowled. \"As for our 'fairy tale',  we happen to have a staggering body of evidence that says that it's  true.\"\n\n\n \"If the papers you've already published are a preview, we think it's  false as Satan.\"\n\n\n \"And our controls are above suspicion.\"\n\n\n \"So far, we haven't found any way to set up logical controls,\" said  Melrose. \"We've done a lot of work on it, too.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes\u2014I've heard about your work. Not bad, really. A little  misdirected, is all.\"\n\n\n \"According to your Theory, that is.\"\n\n\n \"Wildly unorthodox approach to psionics\u2014but at least you're energetic  enough.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't been energetic enough to find an orthodox approach that got  us anywhere. We doubt if you have, either. But maybe we're all wrong.\"  Melrose grinned unpleasantly. \"We're not unreasonable, your Majesty. We  just ask to be shown. If you dare, that is.\"\n\n\n Lessing slammed his fist down on the desk angrily. \"Have you got the  day to take a trip?\"\n\n\n \"I've got 'til New Year.\"\n\n\n Lessing shouted for his girl. \"Get Dorffman up here. We're going to the  Farm this afternoon.\"\n\n\n The girl nodded, then hesitated. \"But what about your lunch?\"\n\n\n \"Bother lunch.\" He gave Melrose a sidelong glare. \"We've got a guest  here who's got a lot of words he's going to eat for us....\" Ten minutes later they rode the elevator down to the transit levels  and boarded the little shuttle car in the terminal below the  Hoffman Center. They sat in silence as the car dipped down into the  rapid-transit channels beneath the great city, swinging northward in  the express circuit through Philadelphia and Camden sectors, surfacing  briefly in Trenton sector, then dropping underground once again for the  long pull beneath Newark, Manhattan and Westchester sectors. In less  than twenty minutes the car surfaced on a Parkway channel and buzzed  north and east through the verdant Connecticut countryside.\n\n\n \"What about Tommy?\" Lessing asked Dorffman as the car sped along  through the afternoon sun.\n\n\n \"I just finished the prelims. He's not cooperating.\"\n\n\n Lessing ground his teeth. \"I should be running him now instead of  beating the bushes with this\u2014\" He broke off to glare at young Melrose.\n\n\n Melrose grinned. \"I've heard you have quite a place up here.\"\n\n\n \"It's\u2014unconventional, at any rate,\" Lessing snapped.\n\n\n \"Well, that depends on your standards. Sounds like a country day  school, from what I've heard. According to your papers, you've even  used conventional statistical analysis on your data from up here.\"\n\n\n \"Until we had to throw it out. We discovered that what we were trying  to measure didn't make sense in a statistical analysis.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, you're sure you were measuring something .\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. We certainly were.\"\n\n\n \"Yet you said that you didn't know what.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Lessing. \"We don't.\"\n\n\n \"And you don't know why your instruments measure whatever they're  measuring.\" The Chicago man's face was thoughtful. \"In fact, you can't  really be certain that your instruments are measuring the children at  all. It's not inconceivable that the children might be measuring the instruments , eh?\"\n\n\n Lessing blinked. \"It's conceivable.\"\n\n\n \"Mmmm,\" said Melrose. \"Sounds like a real firm foundation to build a  theory on.\"\n\n\n \"Why not?\" Lessing growled. \"It wouldn't be the first time the tail  wagged the dog. The psychiatrists never would have gotten out of their  rut if somebody hadn't gotten smart and realized that one of their new  drugs worked better in combatting schizophrenia when the doctor took  the medicine instead of the patient. That was quite a wall to climb.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, wasn't it,\" mused Melrose, scratching his bony jaw. \"Only took  them seventy years to climb it, thanks to a certain man's theories.  I wonder how long it'll take psionics to crawl out of the pit you're  digging for it?\"\n\n\n \"We're not digging any pit,\" Lessing exploded angrily. \"We're  exploring\u2014nothing more. A phenomenon exists. We've known that, one way  or another, for centuries. The fact that it doesn't seem to be bound by  the same sort of natural law we've observed elsewhere doesn't mean that  it isn't governed by natural law. But how can we define the law? How  can we define the limits of the phenomenon, for that matter? We can't  work in the dark forever\u2014we've got to have a working hypothesis to  guide us.\"\n\n\n \"So you dreamed up this 'tadpole' idea,\" said Melrose sourly.\n\n\n \"For a working hypothesis\u2014yes. We've known for a long time that every  human being has extrasensory potential to one degree or another. Not  just a few here and there\u2014every single one. It's a differentiating  quality of the human mind. Just as the ability to think logically in a  crisis instead of giving way to panic is a differentiating quality.\"\n\n\n \"Fine,\" said Melrose. \"Great. We can't prove that, of course, but  I'll play along.\"\n\n\n Lessing glared at him. \"When we began studying this psi-potential, we  found out some curious things. For one thing, it seemed to be immensely  more powerful and active in infants and children than in adults.  Somewhere along the line as a child grows up, something happens. We  don't know what. We do know that the child's psi-potential gradually  withdraws deeper and deeper into his mind, burying itself farther and  farther out of reach, just the way a tadpole's tail is absorbed deeper  and deeper into the growing frog until there just isn't any tail any  more.\" Lessing paused, packing tobacco into his pipe. \"That's why we  have the Farm\u2014to try to discover why. What forces that potential  underground? What buries it so deeply that adult human beings can't get  at it any more?\"\n\n\n \"And you think you have an answer,\" said Melrose.\n\n\n \"We think we might be near an answer. We have a theory that explains  the available data.\"\n\n\n The shuttle car bounced sharply as it left the highway automatics.  Dorffman took the controls. In a few moments they were skimming through  the high white gates of the Farm, slowing down at the entrance to a  long, low building.\n\n\n \"All right, young man\u2014come along,\" said Lessing. \"I think we can show  you our answer.\" In the main office building they donned the close-fitting psionic  monitors required of all personnel at the Farm. They were of a  hard grey plastic material, with a network of wiring buried in the  substance, connected to a simple pocket-sized power source.\n\n\n \"The major problem,\" Lessing said, \"has been to shield the children  from any external psionic stimuli, except those we wished to expose  them to. Our goal is a perfectly controlled psi environment. The  monitors are quite effective\u2014a simple Renwick scrambler screen.\"\n\n\n \"It blocks off all types of psi activity?\" asked Melrose.\n\n\n \"As far as we can measure, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Which may not be very far.\"\n\n\n Jack Dorffman burst in: \"What Dr. Lessing is saying is that they seem  effective for our purposes.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't know why,\" added Melrose.\n\n\n \"All right, we don't know why. Nobody knows why a Renwick screen  works\u2014why blame us?\" They were walking down the main corridor and out  through an open areaway. Behind the buildings was a broad playground. A  baseball game was in progress in one corner; across the field a group  of swings, slides, ring bars and other playground paraphernalia was in  heavy use. The place was teeming with youngsters, all shouting in a  fury of busy activity. Occasionally a helmeted supervisor hurried by;  one waved to them as she rescued a four-year-old from the parallel bars.\n\n\n They crossed into the next building, where classes were in progress.  \"Some of our children are here only briefly,\" Lessing explained as  they walked along, \"and some have been here for years. We maintain a  top-ranking curriculum\u2014your idea of a 'country day school' wasn't  so far afield at that\u2014with scholarships supported by Hoffman Center  funds. Other children come to us\u2014foundlings, desertees, children from  broken homes, children of all ages from infancy on. Sometimes they  stay until they have reached college age, or go on to jobs. As far as  psionics research is concerned, we are not trying to be teachers. We  are strictly observers. We try to place the youngsters in positions  where they can develope what potential they have\u2014 without the  presence of external psionic influences they would normally be subject  to. The results have been remarkable.\"\n\n\n He led them into a long, narrow room with chairs and ash trays, facing  a wide grey glass wall. The room fell into darkness, and through the  grey glass they could see three children, about four years old, playing  in a large room.\n\n\n \"They're perfectly insulated from us,\" said Lessing. \"A variety of  recording instruments are working. And before you ask, Dr. Melrose,  they are all empirical instruments, and they would all defy any  engineer's attempts to determine what makes them go. We don't know what  makes them go, and we don't care\u2014they go. That's all we need. Like  that one, for instance\u2014\"\n\n\n In the corner a flat screen was flickering, emitting a pale green  fluorescent light. It hung from the wall by two plastic rods which  penetrated into the children's room. There was no sign of a switch,  nor a power source. As the children moved about, the screen flickered.  Below it, a recording-tape clicked along in little spurts and starts of  activity.\n\n\n \"What are they doing?\" Melrose asked after watching the children a few  moments.\n\n\n \"Those three seem to work as a team, somehow. Each one, individually,  had a fairly constant recordable psi potential of about seventeen on  the arbitrary scale we find useful here. Any two of them scale in at  thirty-four to thirty-six. Put the three together and they operate  somewhere in the neighborhood of six hundred on the same scale.\"  Lessing smiled. \"This is an isolated phenomenon\u2014it doesn't hold for  any other three children on the Farm. Nor did we make any effort to  place them together\u2014they drew each other like magnets. One of our  workers spent two weeks trying to find out why the instruments weren't  right. It wasn't the instruments, of course.\"\n\n\n Lessing nodded to an attendant, and peered around at Melrose. \"Now, I  want you to watch this very closely.\"\n\n\n He opened a door and walked into the room with the children. The  fluorescent screen continued to flicker as the children ran to Lessing.  He inspected the block tower they were building, and stooped down to  talk to them, his lips moving soundlessly behind the observation wall.  The children laughed and jabbered, apparently intrigued by the game he  was proposing. He walked to the table and tapped the bottom block in  the tower with his thumb.\n\n\n The tower quivered, and the screen blazed out with green light, but the  tower stood. Carefully Lessing jogged all the foundation blocks out of  place until the tower hung in midair, clearly unsupported. The children  watched it closely, and the foundation blocks inched still further out  of place.... Then, quite casually, Lessing lifted off his monitor. The children  continued staring at the tower as the screen gave three or four violent  bursts of green fire and went dark.\n\n\n The block tower fell with a crash.\n\n\n Moments later Lessing was back in the observation room, leaving the  children busily putting the tower back together. There was a little  smile on his lips as he saw Melrose's face. \"Perhaps you're beginning  to see what I'm driving at,\" he said slowly.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Melrose. \"I think I'm beginning to see.\" He scratched his  jaw. \"You think that it's adult psi-contact that drives the child's  potential underground\u2014that somehow adult contact acts like a damper, a  sort of colossal candle-snuffer.\"\n\n\n \"That's what I think,\" said Lessing.\n\n\n \"How do you know those children didn't make you take off your monitor?\"\n\n\n Lessing blinked. \"Why should they?\"\n\n\n \"Maybe they enjoy the crash when the blocks fall down.\"\n\n\n \"But that wouldn't make any difference, would it? The blocks still fall  down.\"\n\n\n Melrose paced down the narrow room. \"This is very good,\" he said  suddenly, his voice earnest. \"You have fine facilities here, good  workers. And in spite of my flippancy, Dr. Lessing, I have never  imagined for a moment that you were not an acute observer and a  careful, highly imaginative worker. But suppose I told you, in perfect  faith, that we have data that flatly contradicts everything you've told  me today. Reproducible data, utterly incompatable with yours. What  would you say to that?\"\n\n\n \"I'd say you were wrong,\" said Lessing. \"You couldn't have such data.  According to the things I am certain are true, what you're saying is  sheer nonsense.\"\n\n\n \"And you'd express that opinion in a professional meeting?\"\n\n\n \"I would.\"\n\n\n \"And as an Authority on psionic behavior patterns,\" said Melrose  slowly, \"you would kill us then and there. You would strangle us  professionally, discredit anything we did, cut us off cold.\" The  tall man turned on him fiercely. \"Are you blind, man? Can't you see  what danger you're in? If you publish your book now, you will become  an Authority in a field where the most devastating thing that could  possibly happen would be\u2014 the appearance of an Authority .\" Lessing and Dorffman rode back to the Hoffman Center in grim silence.  At first Lessing pretended to work; finally he snapped off the tape  recorder in disgust and stared out the shuttle-car window. Melrose had  gone on to Idlewild to catch a jet back to Chicago. It was a relief to  see him go, Lessing thought, and tried to force the thin, angry man  firmly out of his mind. But somehow Melrose wouldn't force.\n\n\n \"Stop worrying about it,\" Dorffman urged. \"He's a crackpot. He's  crawled way out on a limb, and now he's afraid your theory is going to  cut it off under him. Well, that's his worry, not yours.\" Dorffman's  face was intense. \"Scientifically, you're on unshakeable ground. Every  great researcher has people like Melrose sniping at him. You just have  to throw them off and keep going.\"\n\n\n Lessing shook his head. \"Maybe. But this field of work is different  from any other, Jack. It doesn't follow the rules. Maybe scientific  grounds aren't right at all, in this case.\"\n\n\n Dorffman snorted. \"Surely there's nothing wrong with theorizing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"He wasn't objecting to the theory. He's afraid of what happens after  the theory.\"\n\n\n \"So it seems. But why?\"\n\n\n \"Have you ever considered what makes a man an Authority?\"\n\n\n \"He knows more about his field than anybody else does.\"\n\n\n \"He seems to, you mean. And therefore, anything he says about it  carries more weight than what anybody else says. Other workers follow  his lead. He developes ideas, formulates theories\u2014and then defends  them for all he's worth .\"\n\n\n \"But why shouldn't he?\"\n\n\n \"Because a man can't fight for his life and reputation and still keep  his objectivity,\" said Lessing. \"And what if he just happens to be  wrong? Once he's an Authority the question of what's right and what's  wrong gets lost in the shuffle. It's what he says that counts.\"\n\n\n \"But we know you're right,\" Dorffman protested.\n\n\n \"Do we?\"\n\n\n \"Of course we do! Look at our work! Look at what we've seen on the  Farm.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, I know.\" Lessing's voice was weary. \"But first I think we'd  better look at Tommy Gilman, and the quicker we look, the better\u2014\"\n\n\n A nurse greeted them as they stepped off the elevator. \"We called  you at the Farm, but you'd already left. The boy\u2014\" She broke off  helplessly. \"He's sick, Doctor. He's sicker than we ever imagined.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing exactly\u2014happened. I don't quite know how to describe it.\"  She hurried them down the corridor and opened a door into a large  children's playroom. \"See what you think.\"\n\n\n The boy sat stolidly in the corner of the room. He looked up as they  came in, but there was no flicker of recognition or pleasure on his  pale face. The monitor helmet was still on his head. He just sat there,  gripping a toy fire engine tightly in his hands.\n\n\n Lessing crossed the room swiftly. \"Tommy,\" he said.\n\n\n The boy didn't even look at him. He stared stupidly at the fire engine.\n\n\n \"Tommy!\" Lessing reached out for the toy. The boy drew back in terror,  clutching it to his chest. \"Go away,\" he choked. \"Go away, go away\u2014\"  When Lessing persisted the boy bent over swiftly and bit him hard on  the hand.\n\n\n Lessing sat down on the table. \"Tommy, listen to me.\" His voice was  gentle. \"I won't try to take it again. I promise.\"\n\n\n \"Go away.\"\n\n\n \"Do you know who I am?\"\n\n\n Tommy's eyes shifted haltingly to Lessing's face. He nodded. \"Go away.\"\n\n\n \"Why are you afraid, Tommy?\"\n\n\n \"I hurt. My head hurts. I hurt all over. Go away.\"\n\n\n \"Why do you hurt?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014can't get it\u2014off,\" the boy said. The monitor , Lessing thought suddenly. Something had suddenly gone  horribly wrong\u2014could the boy really be sensing the source of the  trouble? Lessing felt a cold knot gather in the pit of his stomach. He  knew what happened when adult psi-contact struck a psi-high youngster's  mind. He had seen it a hundred times at the Farm. But even more\u2014he  had felt it in his own mind, bursting from the child. Like a violent  physical blow, the hate and fear and suspicion and cruelty buried and  repressed in the adult mind, crushing suddenly into the raw receptors  of the child's mind like a smothering fog\u2014it was a fearful thing. A  healthy youngster could survive it, even though the scar remained. But  this youngster was sick\u2014\n\n\n And yet an animal instinctively seeks its own protection . With  trembling fingers Lessing reached out and opened the baffle-snap on the  monitor. \"Take it off, Tommy,\" he whispered.\n\n\n The boy blinked in amazement, and pulled the grey helmet from his head.  Lessing felt the familiar prickly feeling run down his scalp as the  boy stared at him. He could feel deep in his own mind the cold chill  of terror radiating from the boy. Then, suddenly, it began to fade. A  sense of warmth\u2014peace and security and comfort\u2014swept in as the fear  faded from the boy's face.\n\n\n The fire engine clattered to the floor. They analyzed the tapes later, punching the data cards with greatest  care, filing them through the machines for the basic processing and  classification that all their data underwent. It was late that night  when they had the report back in their hands.\n\n\n Dorffman stared at it angrily. \"It's obviously wrong,\" he grated. \"It  doesn't fit. Dave, it doesn't agree with anything we've observed  before. There must be an error.\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Lessing. \"According to the theory. The theory says  that adult psi-contact is deadly to the growing child. It smothers  their potential through repeated contact until it dries up completely.  We've proved that, haven't we? Time after time. Everything goes  according to the theory\u2014except Tommy. But Tommy's psi-potential was  drying up there on the Farm, until the distortion was threatening the  balance of his mind. Then he made an adult contact, and we saw how he  bloomed.\" Lessing sank down to his desk wearily. \"What are we going to  do, Jack? Formulate a separate theory for Tommy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" said Dorffman. \"The instruments were wrong. Somehow we  misread the data\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Didn't you see his face ?\" Lessing burst out. \"Didn't you see how he acted ? What do you want with an instrument reading?\" He shook his  head. \"It's no good, Jack. Something different happened here, something  we'd never counted on. It's something the theory just doesn't allow  for.\"\n\n\n They sat silently for a while. Then Dorffman said: \"What are you going  to do?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" said Lessing. \"Maybe when we fell into this bramble  bush we blinded ourselves with the urge to classify\u2014to line everything  up in neat rows like pins in a paper. Maybe we were so blind we missed  the path altogether.\"\n\n\n \"But the book is due! The Conference speech\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I think we'll make some changes in the book,\" Lessing said slowly.  \"It'll be costly\u2014but it might even be fun. It's a pretty dry, logical  presentation of ideas, as it stands. Very austere and authoritarian.  But a few revisions could change all that\u2014\" He rubbed his hands  together thoughtfully. \"How about it, Jack? Do we have nerve enough to  be laughed at? Do you think we could stand a little discredit, making  silly asses of ourselves? Because when I finish this book, we'll be  laughed out of existence. There won't be any Authority in psionics for  a while\u2014and maybe that way one of the lads who's really sniffing out  the trail will get somebody to listen to him!\n\n\n \"Get a pad, get a pencil! We've got work to do. And when we finish, I  think we'll send a carbon copy out Chicago way. Might even persuade  that puppy out there to come here and work for me\u2014\" ",

NOURSE [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, August 1957.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There was a man in our town, and he was wondrous wise; He jumped into a bramble bush and scratched out both his eyes. And when he saw what he had done, with all his might and main He jumped into another bush and scratched them in again. MOTHER GOOSE Dr. David Lessing found Jack Dorffman and the boy waiting in his office  when he arrived at the Hoffman Center that morning. Dorffman looked as  though he'd been running all night. There were dark pouches under his  eyes; his heavy unshaven face seemed to sag at every crease. Lessing  glanced sharply at his Field Director and sank down behind his desk  with a sigh. \"All right, Jack\u2014what's wrong?\"\n\n\n \"This kid is driving me nuts,\" said Dorffman through clenched teeth.  \"He's gone completely hay-wire. Nobody's been able to get near him  for three weeks, and now at six o'clock this morning he decides he's  leaving the Farm. I talk to him, I sweat him down, I do everything but  tie him to the bed, and I waste my time. He's leaving the Farm. Period.\"\n\n\n \"So you bring him down here,\" said Lessing sourly. \"The worst place he  could be, if something's really wrong.\" He looked across at the boy.  \"Tommy? Come over and sit down.\"\n\n\n There was nothing singular about the boy's appearance. He was thin,  with a pale freckled face and the guileless expression of any normal  eight-year-old as he blinked across the desk at Lessing. The awkward  grey monitor-helmet concealed a shock of sandy hair. He sat with a mute  appeal in his large grey eyes as Lessing flipped the reader-switch and  blinked in alarm at the wildly thrashing pattern on the tape.\n\n\n The boy was terrorized. He was literally pulsating with fear.\n\n\n Lessing sat back slowly. \"Tell me about it, Tommy,\" he said gently.\n\n\n \"I don't want to go back to the Farm,\" said the boy.\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"I just don't. I hate it there.\"\n\n\n \"Are you frightened?\"\n\n\n The boy bit his lip and nodded slowly.\n\n\n \"Of me? Of Dr. Dorffman?\"\n\n\n \"No. Oh, no!\"\n\n\n \"Then what?\"\n\n\n Again the mute appeal in the boy's eyes. He groped for words, and none  came. Finally he said, \"If I could only take this off\u2014\" He fingered  the grey plastic helmet.\n\n\n \"You think that would make you feel better?\"\n\n\n \"It would, I know it would.\"\n\n\n Lessing shook his head. \"I don't think so, Tommy. You know what the  monitor is for, don't you?\"\n\n\n \"It stops things from going out.\"\n\n\n \"That's right. And it stops things from going in. It's an insulator.  You need it badly. It would hurt you a great deal if you took it off,  away from the Farm.\"\n\n\n The boy fought back tears. \"But I don't want to go back there\u2014\" The  fear-pattern was alive again on the tape. \"I don't feel good there. I  never want to go back.\"\n\n\n \"Well, we'll see. You can stay here for a while.\" Lessing nodded at  Dorffman and stepped into an adjoining room with him. \"You say this has  been going on for three weeks ?\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid so. We thought it was just a temporary pattern\u2014we see so  much of that up there.\"\n\n\n \"I know, I know.\" Lessing chewed his lip. \"I don't like it. We'd better  set up a battery on him and try to spot the trouble. And I'm afraid  you'll have to set it up. I've got that young Melrose from Chicago to  deal with this morning\u2014the one who's threatening to upset the whole  Conference next month with some crazy theories he's been playing with.  I'll probably have to take him out to the Farm to shut him up.\" Lessing  ran a hand through sparse grey hair. \"See what you can do for the boy  downstairs.\"\n\n\n \"Full psi precautions?\" asked Dorffman.\n\n\n \"Certainly! And Jack\u2014in this case, be sure of it. If Tommy's in the  trouble I think he's in, we don't dare risk a chance of Adult Contact  now. We could end up with a dead boy on our hands.\" Two letters were waiting on Lessing's desk that morning. The first was  from Roberts Bros., announcing another shift of deadline on the book,  and demanding the galley proofs two weeks earlier than scheduled.  Lessing groaned. As director of psionic research at the Hoffman Medical  Center, he had long since learned how administrative detail could suck  up daytime hours. He knew that his real work was at the Farm\u2014yet he  hadn't even been to the Farm in over six weeks. And now, as the book  approached publication date, Lessing wondered if he would ever really  get back to work again.\n\n\n The other letter cheered him a bit more. It bore the letterhead of the  International Psionics Conference:\n\n\n Dear Dr. Lessing:\n\n\n In recognition of your position as an authority on human Psionic  behavior patterns, we would be gratified to schedule you as principle  speaker at the Conference in Chicago on October 12th. A few remarks in  discussion of your forthcoming book would be entirely in order\u2014\n\n\n They were waiting for it, then! He ran the galley proofs into the  scanner excitedly. They knew he had something up his sleeve. His  earlier papers had only hinted at the direction he was going\u2014but the  book would clear away the fog. He scanned the title page proudly. \"A  Theory of Psionic Influence on Infant and Child Development.\" A good  title\u2014concise, commanding, yet modest. They would read it, all right.  And they would find it a light shining brightly in the darkness, a  guide to the men who were floundering in the jungle of a strange and  baffling new science.\n\n\n For they were floundering. When they were finally forced to recognize  that this great and powerful force did indeed exist in human minds,  with unimaginable potential if it could only be unlocked, they had  plunged eagerly into the search, and found themselves in a maddening  bramble bush of contradictions and chaos. Nothing worked, and  everything worked too well. They were trying to study phenomena which  made no sense, observing things that defied logic. Natural laws came  crashing down about their ears as they stood sadly by and watched  things happen which natural law said could never happen. They had never  been in this jungle before, nor in any jungle remotely like it. The  old rules didn't work here, the old methods of study failed. And the  more they struggled, the thicker and more impenetrable the bramble bush  became\u2014\n\n\n But now David Lessing had discovered a pathway through that jungle, a  theory to work by\u2014\n\n\n At his elbow the intercom buzzed. \"A gentleman to see you,\" the girl  said. \"A Dr. Melrose. He's very impatient, sir.\"\n\n\n He shut off the scanner and said, \"Send him in, please.\" Dr. Peter Melrose was tall and thin, with jet black hair and dark  mocking eyes. He wore a threadbare sport coat and a slouch. He offered  Lessing a bony hand, then flung himself into a chair as he stared about  the office in awe.\n\n\n \"I'm really overwhelmed,\" he said after a moment. \"Within the  stronghold of psionic research at last. And face to face with the  Master in the trembling flesh!\"\n\n\n Lessing frowned. \"Dr. Melrose, I don't quite understand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it's just that I'm impressed,\" the young man said airily. \"Of  course, I've seen old dried-up Authorities before\u2014but never before  a brand spanking new one, just fresh out of the pupa, so to speak!\"  He touched his forehead in a gesture of reverence. \"I bow before the  Oracle. Speak, oh Motah, live forever! Cast a pearl at my feet!\"\n\n\n \"If you've come here to be insulting,\" Lessing said coldly, \"you're  just wasting time.\" He reached for the intercom switch.\n\n\n \"I think you'd better wait before you do that,\" Melrose said sharply,  \"because I'm planning to take you apart at the Conference next month  unless I like everything I see and hear down here today. And if you  don't think I can do it, you're in for quite a dumping.\"\n\n\n Lessing sat back slowly. \"Tell me\u2014just what, exactly, do you want?\"\n\n\n \"I want to hear this fairy tale you're about to publish in the name of  'Theory',\" Melrose said. \"I want to see this famous Farm of yours up in  Connecticut and see for myself how much pressure these experimental  controls you keep talking about will actually bear. But mostly, I want  to see just what in psionic hell you're so busy making yourself an  Authority about.\" There was no laughter in the man's sharp brown eyes.\n\n\n \"You couldn't touch me with a ten foot pole at this conference,\"  snapped Lessing.\n\n\n The other man grinned. \"Try me! We shook you up a little bit last year,  but you didn't seem to get the idea.\"\n\n\n \"Last year was different.\" Lessing scowled. \"As for our 'fairy tale',  we happen to have a staggering body of evidence that says that it's  true.\"\n\n\n \"If the papers you've already published are a preview, we think it's  false as Satan.\"\n\n\n \"And our controls are above suspicion.\"\n\n\n \"So far, we haven't found any way to set up logical controls,\" said  Melrose. \"We've done a lot of work on it, too.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes\u2014I've heard about your work. Not bad, really. A little  misdirected, is all.\"\n\n\n \"According to your Theory, that is.\"\n\n\n \"Wildly unorthodox approach to psionics\u2014but at least you're energetic  enough.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't been energetic enough to find an orthodox approach that got  us anywhere. We doubt if you have, either. But maybe we're all wrong.\"  Melrose grinned unpleasantly. \"We're not unreasonable, your Majesty. We  just ask to be shown. If you dare, that is.\"\n\n\n Lessing slammed his fist down on the desk angrily. \"Have you got the  day to take a trip?\"\n\n\n \"I've got 'til New Year.\"\n\n\n Lessing shouted for his girl. \"Get Dorffman up here. We're going to the  Farm this afternoon.\"\n\n\n The girl nodded, then hesitated. \"But what about your lunch?\"\n\n\n \"Bother lunch.\" He gave Melrose a sidelong glare. \"We've got a guest  here who's got a lot of words he's going to eat for us....\" Ten minutes later they rode the elevator down to the transit levels  and boarded the little shuttle car in the terminal below the  Hoffman Center. They sat in silence as the car dipped down into the  rapid-transit channels beneath the great city, swinging northward in  the express circuit through Philadelphia and Camden sectors, surfacing  briefly in Trenton sector, then dropping underground once again for the  long pull beneath Newark, Manhattan and Westchester sectors. In less  than twenty minutes the car surfaced on a Parkway channel and buzzed  north and east through the verdant Connecticut countryside.\n\n\n \"What about Tommy?\" Lessing asked Dorffman as the car sped along  through the afternoon sun.\n\n\n \"I just finished the prelims. He's not cooperating.\"\n\n\n Lessing ground his teeth. \"I should be running him now instead of  beating the bushes with this\u2014\" He broke off to glare at young Melrose.\n\n\n Melrose grinned. \"I've heard you have quite a place up here.\"\n\n\n \"It's\u2014unconventional, at any rate,\" Lessing snapped.\n\n\n \"Well, that depends on your standards. Sounds like a country day  school, from what I've heard. According to your papers, you've even  used conventional statistical analysis on your data from up here.\"\n\n\n \"Until we had to throw it out. We discovered that what we were trying  to measure didn't make sense in a statistical analysis.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, you're sure you were measuring something .\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. We certainly were.\"\n\n\n \"Yet you said that you didn't know what.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Lessing. \"We don't.\"\n\n\n \"And you don't know why your instruments measure whatever they're  measuring.\" The Chicago man's face was thoughtful. \"In fact, you can't  really be certain that your instruments are measuring the children at  all. It's not inconceivable that the children might be measuring the instruments , eh?\"\n\n\n Lessing blinked. \"It's conceivable.\"\n\n\n \"Mmmm,\" said Melrose. \"Sounds like a real firm foundation to build a  theory on.\"\n\n\n \"Why not?\" Lessing growled. \"It wouldn't be the first time the tail  wagged the dog. The psychiatrists never would have gotten out of their  rut if somebody hadn't gotten smart and realized that one of their new  drugs worked better in combatting schizophrenia when the doctor took  the medicine instead of the patient. That was quite a wall to climb.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, wasn't it,\" mused Melrose, scratching his bony jaw. \"Only took  them seventy years to climb it, thanks to a certain man's theories.  I wonder how long it'll take psionics to crawl out of the pit you're  digging for it?\"\n\n\n \"We're not digging any pit,\" Lessing exploded angrily. \"We're  exploring\u2014nothing more. A phenomenon exists. We've known that, one way  or another, for centuries. The fact that it doesn't seem to be bound by  the same sort of natural law we've observed elsewhere doesn't mean that  it isn't governed by natural law. But how can we define the law? How  can we define the limits of the phenomenon, for that matter? We can't  work in the dark forever\u2014we've got to have a working hypothesis to  guide us.\"\n\n\n \"So you dreamed up this 'tadpole' idea,\" said Melrose sourly.\n\n\n \"For a working hypothesis\u2014yes. We've known for a long time that every  human being has extrasensory potential to one degree or another. Not  just a few here and there\u2014every single one. It's a differentiating  quality of the human mind. Just as the ability to think logically in a  crisis instead of giving way to panic is a differentiating quality.\"\n\n\n \"Fine,\" said Melrose. \"Great. We can't prove that, of course, but  I'll play along.\"\n\n\n Lessing glared at him. \"When we began studying this psi-potential, we  found out some curious things. For one thing, it seemed to be immensely  more powerful and active in infants and children than in adults.  Somewhere along the line as a child grows up, something happens. We  don't know what. We do know that the child's psi-potential gradually  withdraws deeper and deeper into his mind, burying itself farther and  farther out of reach, just the way a tadpole's tail is absorbed deeper  and deeper into the growing frog until there just isn't any tail any  more.\" Lessing paused, packing tobacco into his pipe. \"That's why we  have the Farm\u2014to try to discover why. What forces that potential  underground? What buries it so deeply that adult human beings can't get  at it any more?\"\n\n\n \"And you think you have an answer,\" said Melrose.\n\n\n \"We think we might be near an answer. We have a theory that explains  the available data.\"\n\n\n The shuttle car bounced sharply as it left the highway automatics.  Dorffman took the controls. In a few moments they were skimming through  the high white gates of the Farm, slowing down at the entrance to a  long, low building.\n\n\n \"All right, young man\u2014come along,\" said Lessing. \"I think we can show  you our answer.\" In the main office building they donned the close-fitting psionic  monitors required of all personnel at the Farm. They were of a  hard grey plastic material, with a network of wiring buried in the  substance, connected to a simple pocket-sized power source.\n\n\n \"The major problem,\" Lessing said, \"has been to shield the children  from any external psionic stimuli, except those we wished to expose  them to. Our goal is a perfectly controlled psi environment. The  monitors are quite effective\u2014a simple Renwick scrambler screen.\"\n\n\n \"It blocks off all types of psi activity?\" asked Melrose.\n\n\n \"As far as we can measure, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Which may not be very far.\"\n\n\n Jack Dorffman burst in: \"What Dr. Lessing is saying is that they seem  effective for our purposes.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't know why,\" added Melrose.\n\n\n \"All right, we don't know why. Nobody knows why a Renwick screen  works\u2014why blame us?\" They were walking down the main corridor and out  through an open areaway. Behind the buildings was a broad playground. A  baseball game was in progress in one corner; across the field a group  of swings, slides, ring bars and other playground paraphernalia was in  heavy use. The place was teeming with youngsters, all shouting in a  fury of busy activity. Occasionally a helmeted supervisor hurried by;  one waved to them as she rescued a four-year-old from the parallel bars.\n\n\n They crossed into the next building, where classes were in progress.  \"Some of our children are here only briefly,\" Lessing explained as  they walked along, \"and some have been here for years. We maintain a  top-ranking curriculum\u2014your idea of a 'country day school' wasn't  so far afield at that\u2014with scholarships supported by Hoffman Center  funds. Other children come to us\u2014foundlings, desertees, children from  broken homes, children of all ages from infancy on. Sometimes they  stay until they have reached college age, or go on to jobs. As far as  psionics research is concerned, we are not trying to be teachers. We  are strictly observers. We try to place the youngsters in positions  where they can develope what potential they have\u2014 without the  presence of external psionic influences they would normally be subject  to. The results have been remarkable.\"\n\n\n He led them into a long, narrow room with chairs and ash trays, facing  a wide grey glass wall. The room fell into darkness, and through the  grey glass they could see three children, about four years old, playing  in a large room.\n\n\n \"They're perfectly insulated from us,\" said Lessing. \"A variety of  recording instruments are working. And before you ask, Dr. Melrose,  they are all empirical instruments, and they would all defy any  engineer's attempts to determine what makes them go. We don't know what  makes them go, and we don't care\u2014they go. That's all we need. Like  that one, for instance\u2014\"\n\n\n In the corner a flat screen was flickering, emitting a pale green  fluorescent light. It hung from the wall by two plastic rods which  penetrated into the children's room. There was no sign of a switch,  nor a power source. As the children moved about, the screen flickered.  Below it, a recording-tape clicked along in little spurts and starts of  activity.\n\n\n \"What are they doing?\" Melrose asked after watching the children a few  moments.\n\n\n \"Those three seem to work as a team, somehow. Each one, individually,  had a fairly constant recordable psi potential of about seventeen on  the arbitrary scale we find useful here. Any two of them scale in at  thirty-four to thirty-six. Put the three together and they operate  somewhere in the neighborhood of six hundred on the same scale.\"  Lessing smiled. \"This is an isolated phenomenon\u2014it doesn't hold for  any other three children on the Farm. Nor did we make any effort to  place them together\u2014they drew each other like magnets. One of our  workers spent two weeks trying to find out why the instruments weren't  right. It wasn't the instruments, of course.\"\n\n\n Lessing nodded to an attendant, and peered around at Melrose. \"Now, I  want you to watch this very closely.\"\n\n\n He opened a door and walked into the room with the children. The  fluorescent screen continued to flicker as the children ran to Lessing.  He inspected the block tower they were building, and stooped down to  talk to them, his lips moving soundlessly behind the observation wall.  The children laughed and jabbered, apparently intrigued by the game he  was proposing. He walked to the table and tapped the bottom block in  the tower with his thumb.\n\n\n The tower quivered, and the screen blazed out with green light, but the  tower stood. Carefully Lessing jogged all the foundation blocks out of  place until the tower hung in midair, clearly unsupported. The children  watched it closely, and the foundation blocks inched still further out  of place.... Then, quite casually, Lessing lifted off his monitor. The children  continued staring at the tower as the screen gave three or four violent  bursts of green fire and went dark.\n\n\n The block tower fell with a crash.\n\n\n Moments later Lessing was back in the observation room, leaving the  children busily putting the tower back together. There was a little  smile on his lips as he saw Melrose's face. \"Perhaps you're beginning  to see what I'm driving at,\" he said slowly.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Melrose. \"I think I'm beginning to see.\" He scratched his  jaw. \"You think that it's adult psi-contact that drives the child's  potential underground\u2014that somehow adult contact acts like a damper, a  sort of colossal candle-snuffer.\"\n\n\n \"That's what I think,\" said Lessing.\n\n\n \"How do you know those children didn't make you take off your monitor?\"\n\n\n Lessing blinked. \"Why should they?\"\n\n\n \"Maybe they enjoy the crash when the blocks fall down.\"\n\n\n \"But that wouldn't make any difference, would it? The blocks still fall  down.\"\n\n\n Melrose paced down the narrow room. \"This is very good,\" he said  suddenly, his voice earnest. \"You have fine facilities here, good  workers. And in spite of my flippancy, Dr. Lessing, I have never  imagined for a moment that you were not an acute observer and a  careful, highly imaginative worker. But suppose I told you, in perfect  faith, that we have data that flatly contradicts everything you've told  me today. Reproducible data, utterly incompatable with yours. What  would you say to that?\"\n\n\n \"I'd say you were wrong,\" said Lessing. \"You couldn't have such data.  According to the things I am certain are true, what you're saying is  sheer nonsense.\"\n\n\n \"And you'd express that opinion in a professional meeting?\"\n\n\n \"I would.\"\n\n\n \"And as an Authority on psionic behavior patterns,\" said Melrose  slowly, \"you would kill us then and there. You would strangle us  professionally, discredit anything we did, cut us off cold.\" The  tall man turned on him fiercely. \"Are you blind, man? Can't you see  what danger you're in? If you publish your book now, you will become  an Authority in a field where the most devastating thing that could  possibly happen would be\u2014 the appearance of an Authority .\" Lessing and Dorffman rode back to the Hoffman Center in grim silence.  At first Lessing pretended to work; finally he snapped off the tape  recorder in disgust and stared out the shuttle-car window. Melrose had  gone on to Idlewild to catch a jet back to Chicago. It was a relief to  see him go, Lessing thought, and tried to force the thin, angry man  firmly out of his mind. But somehow Melrose wouldn't force.\n\n\n \"Stop worrying about it,\" Dorffman urged. \"He's a crackpot. He's  crawled way out on a limb, and now he's afraid your theory is going to  cut it off under him. Well, that's his worry, not yours.\" Dorffman's  face was intense. \"Scientifically, you're on unshakeable ground. Every  great researcher has people like Melrose sniping at him. You just have  to throw them off and keep going.\"\n\n\n Lessing shook his head. \"Maybe. But this field of work is different  from any other, Jack. It doesn't follow the rules. Maybe scientific  grounds aren't right at all, in this case.\"\n\n\n Dorffman snorted. \"Surely there's nothing wrong with theorizing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"He wasn't objecting to the theory. He's afraid of what happens after  the theory.\"\n\n\n \"So it seems. But why?\"\n\n\n \"Have you ever considered what makes a man an Authority?\"\n\n\n \"He knows more about his field than anybody else does.\"\n\n\n \"He seems to, you mean. And therefore, anything he says about it  carries more weight than what anybody else says. Other workers follow  his lead. He developes ideas, formulates theories\u2014and then defends  them for all he's worth .\"\n\n\n \"But why shouldn't he?\"\n\n\n \"Because a man can't fight for his life and reputation and still keep  his objectivity,\" said Lessing. \"And what if he just happens to be  wrong? Once he's an Authority the question of what's right and what's  wrong gets lost in the shuffle. It's what he says that counts.\"\n\n\n \"But we know you're right,\" Dorffman protested.\n\n\n \"Do we?\"\n\n\n \"Of course we do! Look at our work! Look at what we've seen on the  Farm.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, I know.\" Lessing's voice was weary. \"But first I think we'd  better look at Tommy Gilman, and the quicker we look, the better\u2014\"\n\n\n A nurse greeted them as they stepped off the elevator. \"We called  you at the Farm, but you'd already left. The boy\u2014\" She broke off  helplessly. \"He's sick, Doctor. He's sicker than we ever imagined.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing exactly\u2014happened. I don't quite know how to describe it.\"  She hurried them down the corridor and opened a door into a large  children's playroom. \"See what you think.\"\n\n\n The boy sat stolidly in the corner of the room. He looked up as they  came in, but there was no flicker of recognition or pleasure on his  pale face. The monitor helmet was still on his head. He just sat there,  gripping a toy fire engine tightly in his hands.\n\n\n Lessing crossed the room swiftly. \"Tommy,\" he said.\n\n\n The boy didn't even look at him. He stared stupidly at the fire engine.\n\n\n \"Tommy!\" Lessing reached out for the toy. The boy drew back in terror,  clutching it to his chest. \"Go away,\" he choked. \"Go away, go away\u2014\"  When Lessing persisted the boy bent over swiftly and bit him hard on  the hand.\n\n\n Lessing sat down on the table. \"Tommy, listen to me.\" His voice was  gentle. \"I won't try to take it again. I promise.\"\n\n\n \"Go away.\"\n\n\n \"Do you know who I am?\"\n\n\n Tommy's eyes shifted haltingly to Lessing's face. He nodded. \"Go away.\"\n\n\n \"Why are you afraid, Tommy?\"\n\n\n \"I hurt. My head hurts. I hurt all over. Go away.\"\n\n\n \"Why do you hurt?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014can't get it\u2014off,\" the boy said. The monitor , Lessing thought suddenly. Something had suddenly gone  horribly wrong\u2014could the boy really be sensing the source of the  trouble? Lessing felt a cold knot gather in the pit of his stomach. He  knew what happened when adult psi-contact struck a psi-high youngster's  mind. He had seen it a hundred times at the Farm. But even more\u2014he  had felt it in his own mind, bursting from the child. Like a violent  physical blow, the hate and fear and suspicion and cruelty buried and  repressed in the adult mind, crushing suddenly into the raw receptors  of the child's mind like a smothering fog\u2014it was a fearful thing. A  healthy youngster could survive it, even though the scar remained. But  this youngster was sick\u2014\n\n\n And yet an animal instinctively seeks its own protection . With  trembling fingers Lessing reached out and opened the baffle-snap on the  monitor. \"Take it off, Tommy,\" he whispered.\n\n\n The boy blinked in amazement, and pulled the grey helmet from his head.  Lessing felt the familiar prickly feeling run down his scalp as the  boy stared at him. He could feel deep in his own mind the cold chill  of terror radiating from the boy. Then, suddenly, it began to fade. A  sense of warmth\u2014peace and security and comfort\u2014swept in as the fear  faded from the boy's face.\n\n\n The fire engine clattered to the floor. They analyzed the tapes later, punching the data cards with greatest  care, filing them through the machines for the basic processing and  classification that all their data underwent. It was late that night  when they had the report back in their hands.\n\n\n Dorffman stared at it angrily. \"It's obviously wrong,\" he grated. \"It  doesn't fit. Dave, it doesn't agree with anything we've observed  before. There must be an error.\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Lessing. \"According to the theory. The theory says  that adult psi-contact is deadly to the growing child. It smothers  their potential through repeated contact until it dries up completely.  We've proved that, haven't we? Time after time. Everything goes  according to the theory\u2014except Tommy. But Tommy's psi-potential was  drying up there on the Farm, until the distortion was threatening the  balance of his mind. Then he made an adult contact, and we saw how he  bloomed.\" Lessing sank down to his desk wearily. \"What are we going to  do, Jack? Formulate a separate theory for Tommy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" said Dorffman. \"The instruments were wrong. Somehow we  misread the data\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Didn't you see his face ?\" Lessing burst out. \"Didn't you see how he acted ? What do you want with an instrument reading?\" He shook his  head. \"It's no good, Jack. Something different happened here, something  we'd never counted on. It's something the theory just doesn't allow  for.\"\n\n\n They sat silently for a while. Then Dorffman said: \"What are you going  to do?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" said Lessing. \"Maybe when we fell into this bramble  bush we blinded ourselves with the urge to classify\u2014to line everything  up in neat rows like pins in a paper. Maybe we were so blind we missed  the path altogether.\"\n\n\n \"But the book is due! The Conference speech\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I think we'll make some changes in the book,\" Lessing said slowly.  \"It'll be costly\u2014but it might even be fun. It's a pretty dry, logical  presentation of ideas, as it stands. Very austere and authoritarian.  But a few revisions could change all that\u2014\" He rubbed his hands  together thoughtfully. \"How about it, Jack? Do we have nerve enough to  be laughed at? Do you think we could stand a little discredit, making  silly asses of ourselves? Because when I finish this book, we'll be  laughed out of existence. There won't be any Authority in psionics for  a while\u2014and maybe that way one of the lads who's really sniffing out  the trail will get somebody to listen to him!\n\n\n \"Get a pad, get a pencil! We've got work to do. And when we finish, I  think we'll send a carbon copy out Chicago way. Might even persuade  that puppy out there to come here and work for me\u2014\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does the block tower fall down?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Lessing removed his helmet.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Unknown.

NOURSE [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, August 1957.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There was a man in our town, and he was wondrous wise; He jumped into a bramble bush and scratched out both his eyes. And when he saw what he had done, with all his might and main He jumped into another bush and scratched them in again. MOTHER GOOSE Dr. David Lessing found Jack Dorffman and the boy waiting in his office  when he arrived at the Hoffman Center that morning. Dorffman looked as  though he'd been running all night. There were dark pouches under his  eyes; his heavy unshaven face seemed to sag at every crease. Lessing  glanced sharply at his Field Director and sank down behind his desk  with a sigh. \"All right, Jack\u2014what's wrong?\"\n\n\n \"This kid is driving me nuts,\" said Dorffman through clenched teeth.  \"He's gone completely hay-wire. Nobody's been able to get near him  for three weeks, and now at six o'clock this morning he decides he's  leaving the Farm. I talk to him, I sweat him down, I do everything but  tie him to the bed, and I waste my time. He's leaving the Farm. Period.\"\n\n\n \"So you bring him down here,\" said Lessing sourly. \"The worst place he  could be, if something's really wrong.\" He looked across at the boy.  \"Tommy? Come over and sit down.\"\n\n\n There was nothing singular about the boy's appearance. He was thin,  with a pale freckled face and the guileless expression of any normal  eight-year-old as he blinked across the desk at Lessing. The awkward  grey monitor-helmet concealed a shock of sandy hair. He sat with a mute  appeal in his large grey eyes as Lessing flipped the reader-switch and  blinked in alarm at the wildly thrashing pattern on the tape.\n\n\n The boy was terrorized. He was literally pulsating with fear.\n\n\n Lessing sat back slowly. \"Tell me about it, Tommy,\" he said gently.\n\n\n \"I don't want to go back to the Farm,\" said the boy.\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"I just don't. I hate it there.\"\n\n\n \"Are you frightened?\"\n\n\n The boy bit his lip and nodded slowly.\n\n\n \"Of me? Of Dr. Dorffman?\"\n\n\n \"No. Oh, no!\"\n\n\n \"Then what?\"\n\n\n Again the mute appeal in the boy's eyes. He groped for words, and none  came. Finally he said, \"If I could only take this off\u2014\" He fingered  the grey plastic helmet.\n\n\n \"You think that would make you feel better?\"\n\n\n \"It would, I know it would.\"\n\n\n Lessing shook his head. \"I don't think so, Tommy. You know what the  monitor is for, don't you?\"\n\n\n \"It stops things from going out.\"\n\n\n \"That's right. And it stops things from going in. It's an insulator.  You need it badly. It would hurt you a great deal if you took it off,  away from the Farm.\"\n\n\n The boy fought back tears. \"But I don't want to go back there\u2014\" The  fear-pattern was alive again on the tape. \"I don't feel good there. I  never want to go back.\"\n\n\n \"Well, we'll see. You can stay here for a while.\" Lessing nodded at  Dorffman and stepped into an adjoining room with him. \"You say this has  been going on for three weeks ?\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid so. We thought it was just a temporary pattern\u2014we see so  much of that up there.\"\n\n\n \"I know, I know.\" Lessing chewed his lip. \"I don't like it. We'd better  set up a battery on him and try to spot the trouble. And I'm afraid  you'll have to set it up. I've got that young Melrose from Chicago to  deal with this morning\u2014the one who's threatening to upset the whole  Conference next month with some crazy theories he's been playing with.  I'll probably have to take him out to the Farm to shut him up.\" Lessing  ran a hand through sparse grey hair. \"See what you can do for the boy  downstairs.\"\n\n\n \"Full psi precautions?\" asked Dorffman.\n\n\n \"Certainly! And Jack\u2014in this case, be sure of it. If Tommy's in the  trouble I think he's in, we don't dare risk a chance of Adult Contact  now. We could end up with a dead boy on our hands.\" Two letters were waiting on Lessing's desk that morning. The first was  from Roberts Bros., announcing another shift of deadline on the book,  and demanding the galley proofs two weeks earlier than scheduled.  Lessing groaned. As director of psionic research at the Hoffman Medical  Center, he had long since learned how administrative detail could suck  up daytime hours. He knew that his real work was at the Farm\u2014yet he  hadn't even been to the Farm in over six weeks. And now, as the book  approached publication date, Lessing wondered if he would ever really  get back to work again.\n\n\n The other letter cheered him a bit more. It bore the letterhead of the  International Psionics Conference:\n\n\n Dear Dr. Lessing:\n\n\n In recognition of your position as an authority on human Psionic  behavior patterns, we would be gratified to schedule you as principle  speaker at the Conference in Chicago on October 12th. A few remarks in  discussion of your forthcoming book would be entirely in order\u2014\n\n\n They were waiting for it, then! He ran the galley proofs into the  scanner excitedly. They knew he had something up his sleeve. His  earlier papers had only hinted at the direction he was going\u2014but the  book would clear away the fog. He scanned the title page proudly. \"A  Theory of Psionic Influence on Infant and Child Development.\" A good  title\u2014concise, commanding, yet modest. They would read it, all right.  And they would find it a light shining brightly in the darkness, a  guide to the men who were floundering in the jungle of a strange and  baffling new science.\n\n\n For they were floundering. When they were finally forced to recognize  that this great and powerful force did indeed exist in human minds,  with unimaginable potential if it could only be unlocked, they had  plunged eagerly into the search, and found themselves in a maddening  bramble bush of contradictions and chaos. Nothing worked, and  everything worked too well. They were trying to study phenomena which  made no sense, observing things that defied logic. Natural laws came  crashing down about their ears as they stood sadly by and watched  things happen which natural law said could never happen. They had never  been in this jungle before, nor in any jungle remotely like it. The  old rules didn't work here, the old methods of study failed. And the  more they struggled, the thicker and more impenetrable the bramble bush  became\u2014\n\n\n But now David Lessing had discovered a pathway through that jungle, a  theory to work by\u2014\n\n\n At his elbow the intercom buzzed. \"A gentleman to see you,\" the girl  said. \"A Dr. Melrose. He's very impatient, sir.\"\n\n\n He shut off the scanner and said, \"Send him in, please.\" Dr. Peter Melrose was tall and thin, with jet black hair and dark  mocking eyes. He wore a threadbare sport coat and a slouch. He offered  Lessing a bony hand, then flung himself into a chair as he stared about  the office in awe.\n\n\n \"I'm really overwhelmed,\" he said after a moment. \"Within the  stronghold of psionic research at last. And face to face with the  Master in the trembling flesh!\"\n\n\n Lessing frowned. \"Dr. Melrose, I don't quite understand\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it's just that I'm impressed,\" the young man said airily. \"Of  course, I've seen old dried-up Authorities before\u2014but never before  a brand spanking new one, just fresh out of the pupa, so to speak!\"  He touched his forehead in a gesture of reverence. \"I bow before the  Oracle. Speak, oh Motah, live forever! Cast a pearl at my feet!\"\n\n\n \"If you've come here to be insulting,\" Lessing said coldly, \"you're  just wasting time.\" He reached for the intercom switch.\n\n\n \"I think you'd better wait before you do that,\" Melrose said sharply,  \"because I'm planning to take you apart at the Conference next month  unless I like everything I see and hear down here today. And if you  don't think I can do it, you're in for quite a dumping.\"\n\n\n Lessing sat back slowly. \"Tell me\u2014just what, exactly, do you want?\"\n\n\n \"I want to hear this fairy tale you're about to publish in the name of  'Theory',\" Melrose said. \"I want to see this famous Farm of yours up in  Connecticut and see for myself how much pressure these experimental  controls you keep talking about will actually bear. But mostly, I want  to see just what in psionic hell you're so busy making yourself an  Authority about.\" There was no laughter in the man's sharp brown eyes.\n\n\n \"You couldn't touch me with a ten foot pole at this conference,\"  snapped Lessing.\n\n\n The other man grinned. \"Try me! We shook you up a little bit last year,  but you didn't seem to get the idea.\"\n\n\n \"Last year was different.\" Lessing scowled. \"As for our 'fairy tale',  we happen to have a staggering body of evidence that says that it's  true.\"\n\n\n \"If the papers you've already published are a preview, we think it's  false as Satan.\"\n\n\n \"And our controls are above suspicion.\"\n\n\n \"So far, we haven't found any way to set up logical controls,\" said  Melrose. \"We've done a lot of work on it, too.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes\u2014I've heard about your work. Not bad, really. A little  misdirected, is all.\"\n\n\n \"According to your Theory, that is.\"\n\n\n \"Wildly unorthodox approach to psionics\u2014but at least you're energetic  enough.\"\n\n\n \"We haven't been energetic enough to find an orthodox approach that got  us anywhere. We doubt if you have, either. But maybe we're all wrong.\"  Melrose grinned unpleasantly. \"We're not unreasonable, your Majesty. We  just ask to be shown. If you dare, that is.\"\n\n\n Lessing slammed his fist down on the desk angrily. \"Have you got the  day to take a trip?\"\n\n\n \"I've got 'til New Year.\"\n\n\n Lessing shouted for his girl. \"Get Dorffman up here. We're going to the  Farm this afternoon.\"\n\n\n The girl nodded, then hesitated. \"But what about your lunch?\"\n\n\n \"Bother lunch.\" He gave Melrose a sidelong glare. \"We've got a guest  here who's got a lot of words he's going to eat for us....\" Ten minutes later they rode the elevator down to the transit levels  and boarded the little shuttle car in the terminal below the  Hoffman Center. They sat in silence as the car dipped down into the  rapid-transit channels beneath the great city, swinging northward in  the express circuit through Philadelphia and Camden sectors, surfacing  briefly in Trenton sector, then dropping underground once again for the  long pull beneath Newark, Manhattan and Westchester sectors. In less  than twenty minutes the car surfaced on a Parkway channel and buzzed  north and east through the verdant Connecticut countryside.\n\n\n \"What about Tommy?\" Lessing asked Dorffman as the car sped along  through the afternoon sun.\n\n\n \"I just finished the prelims. He's not cooperating.\"\n\n\n Lessing ground his teeth. \"I should be running him now instead of  beating the bushes with this\u2014\" He broke off to glare at young Melrose.\n\n\n Melrose grinned. \"I've heard you have quite a place up here.\"\n\n\n \"It's\u2014unconventional, at any rate,\" Lessing snapped.\n\n\n \"Well, that depends on your standards. Sounds like a country day  school, from what I've heard. According to your papers, you've even  used conventional statistical analysis on your data from up here.\"\n\n\n \"Until we had to throw it out. We discovered that what we were trying  to measure didn't make sense in a statistical analysis.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, you're sure you were measuring something .\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. We certainly were.\"\n\n\n \"Yet you said that you didn't know what.\"\n\n\n \"That's right,\" said Lessing. \"We don't.\"\n\n\n \"And you don't know why your instruments measure whatever they're  measuring.\" The Chicago man's face was thoughtful. \"In fact, you can't  really be certain that your instruments are measuring the children at  all. It's not inconceivable that the children might be measuring the instruments , eh?\"\n\n\n Lessing blinked. \"It's conceivable.\"\n\n\n \"Mmmm,\" said Melrose. \"Sounds like a real firm foundation to build a  theory on.\"\n\n\n \"Why not?\" Lessing growled. \"It wouldn't be the first time the tail  wagged the dog. The psychiatrists never would have gotten out of their  rut if somebody hadn't gotten smart and realized that one of their new  drugs worked better in combatting schizophrenia when the doctor took  the medicine instead of the patient. That was quite a wall to climb.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, wasn't it,\" mused Melrose, scratching his bony jaw. \"Only took  them seventy years to climb it, thanks to a certain man's theories.  I wonder how long it'll take psionics to crawl out of the pit you're  digging for it?\"\n\n\n \"We're not digging any pit,\" Lessing exploded angrily. \"We're  exploring\u2014nothing more. A phenomenon exists. We've known that, one way  or another, for centuries. The fact that it doesn't seem to be bound by  the same sort of natural law we've observed elsewhere doesn't mean that  it isn't governed by natural law. But how can we define the law? How  can we define the limits of the phenomenon, for that matter? We can't  work in the dark forever\u2014we've got to have a working hypothesis to  guide us.\"\n\n\n \"So you dreamed up this 'tadpole' idea,\" said Melrose sourly.\n\n\n \"For a working hypothesis\u2014yes. We've known for a long time that every  human being has extrasensory potential to one degree or another. Not  just a few here and there\u2014every single one. It's a differentiating  quality of the human mind. Just as the ability to think logically in a  crisis instead of giving way to panic is a differentiating quality.\"\n\n\n \"Fine,\" said Melrose. \"Great. We can't prove that, of course, but  I'll play along.\"\n\n\n Lessing glared at him. \"When we began studying this psi-potential, we  found out some curious things. For one thing, it seemed to be immensely  more powerful and active in infants and children than in adults.  Somewhere along the line as a child grows up, something happens. We  don't know what. We do know that the child's psi-potential gradually  withdraws deeper and deeper into his mind, burying itself farther and  farther out of reach, just the way a tadpole's tail is absorbed deeper  and deeper into the growing frog until there just isn't any tail any  more.\" Lessing paused, packing tobacco into his pipe. \"That's why we  have the Farm\u2014to try to discover why. What forces that potential  underground? What buries it so deeply that adult human beings can't get  at it any more?\"\n\n\n \"And you think you have an answer,\" said Melrose.\n\n\n \"We think we might be near an answer. We have a theory that explains  the available data.\"\n\n\n The shuttle car bounced sharply as it left the highway automatics.  Dorffman took the controls. In a few moments they were skimming through  the high white gates of the Farm, slowing down at the entrance to a  long, low building.\n\n\n \"All right, young man\u2014come along,\" said Lessing. \"I think we can show  you our answer.\" In the main office building they donned the close-fitting psionic  monitors required of all personnel at the Farm. They were of a  hard grey plastic material, with a network of wiring buried in the  substance, connected to a simple pocket-sized power source.\n\n\n \"The major problem,\" Lessing said, \"has been to shield the children  from any external psionic stimuli, except those we wished to expose  them to. Our goal is a perfectly controlled psi environment. The  monitors are quite effective\u2014a simple Renwick scrambler screen.\"\n\n\n \"It blocks off all types of psi activity?\" asked Melrose.\n\n\n \"As far as we can measure, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Which may not be very far.\"\n\n\n Jack Dorffman burst in: \"What Dr. Lessing is saying is that they seem  effective for our purposes.\"\n\n\n \"But you don't know why,\" added Melrose.\n\n\n \"All right, we don't know why. Nobody knows why a Renwick screen  works\u2014why blame us?\" They were walking down the main corridor and out  through an open areaway. Behind the buildings was a broad playground. A  baseball game was in progress in one corner; across the field a group  of swings, slides, ring bars and other playground paraphernalia was in  heavy use. The place was teeming with youngsters, all shouting in a  fury of busy activity. Occasionally a helmeted supervisor hurried by;  one waved to them as she rescued a four-year-old from the parallel bars.\n\n\n They crossed into the next building, where classes were in progress.  \"Some of our children are here only briefly,\" Lessing explained as  they walked along, \"and some have been here for years. We maintain a  top-ranking curriculum\u2014your idea of a 'country day school' wasn't  so far afield at that\u2014with scholarships supported by Hoffman Center  funds. Other children come to us\u2014foundlings, desertees, children from  broken homes, children of all ages from infancy on. Sometimes they  stay until they have reached college age, or go on to jobs. As far as  psionics research is concerned, we are not trying to be teachers. We  are strictly observers. We try to place the youngsters in positions  where they can develope what potential they have\u2014 without the  presence of external psionic influences they would normally be subject  to. The results have been remarkable.\"\n\n\n He led them into a long, narrow room with chairs and ash trays, facing  a wide grey glass wall. The room fell into darkness, and through the  grey glass they could see three children, about four years old, playing  in a large room.\n\n\n \"They're perfectly insulated from us,\" said Lessing. \"A variety of  recording instruments are working. And before you ask, Dr. Melrose,  they are all empirical instruments, and they would all defy any  engineer's attempts to determine what makes them go. We don't know what  makes them go, and we don't care\u2014they go. That's all we need. Like  that one, for instance\u2014\"\n\n\n In the corner a flat screen was flickering, emitting a pale green  fluorescent light. It hung from the wall by two plastic rods which  penetrated into the children's room. There was no sign of a switch,  nor a power source. As the children moved about, the screen flickered.  Below it, a recording-tape clicked along in little spurts and starts of  activity.\n\n\n \"What are they doing?\" Melrose asked after watching the children a few  moments.\n\n\n \"Those three seem to work as a team, somehow. Each one, individually,  had a fairly constant recordable psi potential of about seventeen on  the arbitrary scale we find useful here. Any two of them scale in at  thirty-four to thirty-six. Put the three together and they operate  somewhere in the neighborhood of six hundred on the same scale.\"  Lessing smiled. \"This is an isolated phenomenon\u2014it doesn't hold for  any other three children on the Farm. Nor did we make any effort to  place them together\u2014they drew each other like magnets. One of our  workers spent two weeks trying to find out why the instruments weren't  right. It wasn't the instruments, of course.\"\n\n\n Lessing nodded to an attendant, and peered around at Melrose. \"Now, I  want you to watch this very closely.\"\n\n\n He opened a door and walked into the room with the children. The  fluorescent screen continued to flicker as the children ran to Lessing.  He inspected the block tower they were building, and stooped down to  talk to them, his lips moving soundlessly behind the observation wall.  The children laughed and jabbered, apparently intrigued by the game he  was proposing. He walked to the table and tapped the bottom block in  the tower with his thumb.\n\n\n The tower quivered, and the screen blazed out with green light, but the  tower stood. Carefully Lessing jogged all the foundation blocks out of  place until the tower hung in midair, clearly unsupported. The children  watched it closely, and the foundation blocks inched still further out  of place.... Then, quite casually, Lessing lifted off his monitor. The children  continued staring at the tower as the screen gave three or four violent  bursts of green fire and went dark.\n\n\n The block tower fell with a crash.\n\n\n Moments later Lessing was back in the observation room, leaving the  children busily putting the tower back together. There was a little  smile on his lips as he saw Melrose's face. \"Perhaps you're beginning  to see what I'm driving at,\" he said slowly.\n\n\n \"Yes,\" said Melrose. \"I think I'm beginning to see.\" He scratched his  jaw. \"You think that it's adult psi-contact that drives the child's  potential underground\u2014that somehow adult contact acts like a damper, a  sort of colossal candle-snuffer.\"\n\n\n \"That's what I think,\" said Lessing.\n\n\n \"How do you know those children didn't make you take off your monitor?\"\n\n\n Lessing blinked. \"Why should they?\"\n\n\n \"Maybe they enjoy the crash when the blocks fall down.\"\n\n\n \"But that wouldn't make any difference, would it? The blocks still fall  down.\"\n\n\n Melrose paced down the narrow room. \"This is very good,\" he said  suddenly, his voice earnest. \"You have fine facilities here, good  workers. And in spite of my flippancy, Dr. Lessing, I have never  imagined for a moment that you were not an acute observer and a  careful, highly imaginative worker. But suppose I told you, in perfect  faith, that we have data that flatly contradicts everything you've told  me today. Reproducible data, utterly incompatable with yours. What  would you say to that?\"\n\n\n \"I'd say you were wrong,\" said Lessing. \"You couldn't have such data.  According to the things I am certain are true, what you're saying is  sheer nonsense.\"\n\n\n \"And you'd express that opinion in a professional meeting?\"\n\n\n \"I would.\"\n\n\n \"And as an Authority on psionic behavior patterns,\" said Melrose  slowly, \"you would kill us then and there. You would strangle us  professionally, discredit anything we did, cut us off cold.\" The  tall man turned on him fiercely. \"Are you blind, man? Can't you see  what danger you're in? If you publish your book now, you will become  an Authority in a field where the most devastating thing that could  possibly happen would be\u2014 the appearance of an Authority .\" Lessing and Dorffman rode back to the Hoffman Center in grim silence.  At first Lessing pretended to work; finally he snapped off the tape  recorder in disgust and stared out the shuttle-car window. Melrose had  gone on to Idlewild to catch a jet back to Chicago. It was a relief to  see him go, Lessing thought, and tried to force the thin, angry man  firmly out of his mind. But somehow Melrose wouldn't force.\n\n\n \"Stop worrying about it,\" Dorffman urged. \"He's a crackpot. He's  crawled way out on a limb, and now he's afraid your theory is going to  cut it off under him. Well, that's his worry, not yours.\" Dorffman's  face was intense. \"Scientifically, you're on unshakeable ground. Every  great researcher has people like Melrose sniping at him. You just have  to throw them off and keep going.\"\n\n\n Lessing shook his head. \"Maybe. But this field of work is different  from any other, Jack. It doesn't follow the rules. Maybe scientific  grounds aren't right at all, in this case.\"\n\n\n Dorffman snorted. \"Surely there's nothing wrong with theorizing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"He wasn't objecting to the theory. He's afraid of what happens after  the theory.\"\n\n\n \"So it seems. But why?\"\n\n\n \"Have you ever considered what makes a man an Authority?\"\n\n\n \"He knows more about his field than anybody else does.\"\n\n\n \"He seems to, you mean. And therefore, anything he says about it  carries more weight than what anybody else says. Other workers follow  his lead. He developes ideas, formulates theories\u2014and then defends  them for all he's worth .\"\n\n\n \"But why shouldn't he?\"\n\n\n \"Because a man can't fight for his life and reputation and still keep  his objectivity,\" said Lessing. \"And what if he just happens to be  wrong? Once he's an Authority the question of what's right and what's  wrong gets lost in the shuffle. It's what he says that counts.\"\n\n\n \"But we know you're right,\" Dorffman protested.\n\n\n \"Do we?\"\n\n\n \"Of course we do! Look at our work! Look at what we've seen on the  Farm.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, I know.\" Lessing's voice was weary. \"But first I think we'd  better look at Tommy Gilman, and the quicker we look, the better\u2014\"\n\n\n A nurse greeted them as they stepped off the elevator. \"We called  you at the Farm, but you'd already left. The boy\u2014\" She broke off  helplessly. \"He's sick, Doctor. He's sicker than we ever imagined.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing exactly\u2014happened. I don't quite know how to describe it.\"  She hurried them down the corridor and opened a door into a large  children's playroom. \"See what you think.\"\n\n\n The boy sat stolidly in the corner of the room. He looked up as they  came in, but there was no flicker of recognition or pleasure on his  pale face. The monitor helmet was still on his head. He just sat there,  gripping a toy fire engine tightly in his hands.\n\n\n Lessing crossed the room swiftly. \"Tommy,\" he said.\n\n\n The boy didn't even look at him. He stared stupidly at the fire engine.\n\n\n \"Tommy!\" Lessing reached out for the toy. The boy drew back in terror,  clutching it to his chest. \"Go away,\" he choked. \"Go away, go away\u2014\"  When Lessing persisted the boy bent over swiftly and bit him hard on  the hand.\n\n\n Lessing sat down on the table. \"Tommy, listen to me.\" His voice was  gentle. \"I won't try to take it again. I promise.\"\n\n\n \"Go away.\"\n\n\n \"Do you know who I am?\"\n\n\n Tommy's eyes shifted haltingly to Lessing's face. He nodded. \"Go away.\"\n\n\n \"Why are you afraid, Tommy?\"\n\n\n \"I hurt. My head hurts. I hurt all over. Go away.\"\n\n\n \"Why do you hurt?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014can't get it\u2014off,\" the boy said. The monitor , Lessing thought suddenly. Something had suddenly gone  horribly wrong\u2014could the boy really be sensing the source of the  trouble? Lessing felt a cold knot gather in the pit of his stomach. He  knew what happened when adult psi-contact struck a psi-high youngster's  mind. He had seen it a hundred times at the Farm. But even more\u2014he  had felt it in his own mind, bursting from the child. Like a violent  physical blow, the hate and fear and suspicion and cruelty buried and  repressed in the adult mind, crushing suddenly into the raw receptors  of the child's mind like a smothering fog\u2014it was a fearful thing. A  healthy youngster could survive it, even though the scar remained. But  this youngster was sick\u2014\n\n\n And yet an animal instinctively seeks its own protection . With  trembling fingers Lessing reached out and opened the baffle-snap on the  monitor. \"Take it off, Tommy,\" he whispered.\n\n\n The boy blinked in amazement, and pulled the grey helmet from his head.  Lessing felt the familiar prickly feeling run down his scalp as the  boy stared at him. He could feel deep in his own mind the cold chill  of terror radiating from the boy. Then, suddenly, it began to fade. A  sense of warmth\u2014peace and security and comfort\u2014swept in as the fear  faded from the boy's face.\n\n\n The fire engine clattered to the floor. They analyzed the tapes later, punching the data cards with greatest  care, filing them through the machines for the basic processing and  classification that all their data underwent. It was late that night  when they had the report back in their hands.\n\n\n Dorffman stared at it angrily. \"It's obviously wrong,\" he grated. \"It  doesn't fit. Dave, it doesn't agree with anything we've observed  before. There must be an error.\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Lessing. \"According to the theory. The theory says  that adult psi-contact is deadly to the growing child. It smothers  their potential through repeated contact until it dries up completely.  We've proved that, haven't we? Time after time. Everything goes  according to the theory\u2014except Tommy. But Tommy's psi-potential was  drying up there on the Farm, until the distortion was threatening the  balance of his mind. Then he made an adult contact, and we saw how he  bloomed.\" Lessing sank down to his desk wearily. \"What are we going to  do, Jack? Formulate a separate theory for Tommy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" said Dorffman. \"The instruments were wrong. Somehow we  misread the data\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Didn't you see his face ?\" Lessing burst out. \"Didn't you see how he acted ? What do you want with an instrument reading?\" He shook his  head. \"It's no good, Jack. Something different happened here, something  we'd never counted on. It's something the theory just doesn't allow  for.\"\n\n\n They sat silently for a while. Then Dorffman said: \"What are you going  to do?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" said Lessing. \"Maybe when we fell into this bramble  bush we blinded ourselves with the urge to classify\u2014to line everything  up in neat rows like pins in a paper. Maybe we were so blind we missed  the path altogether.\"\n\n\n \"But the book is due! The Conference speech\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I think we'll make some changes in the book,\" Lessing said slowly.  \"It'll be costly\u2014but it might even be fun. It's a pretty dry, logical  presentation of ideas, as it stands. Very austere and authoritarian.  But a few revisions could change all that\u2014\" He rubbed his hands  together thoughtfully. \"How about it, Jack? Do we have nerve enough to  be laughed at? Do you think we could stand a little discredit, making  silly asses of ourselves? Because when I finish this book, we'll be  laughed out of existence. There won't be any Authority in psionics for  a while\u2014and maybe that way one of the lads who's really sniffing out  the trail will get somebody to listen to him!\n\n\n \"Get a pad, get a pencil! We've got work to do. And when we finish, I  think we'll send a carbon copy out Chicago way. Might even persuade  that puppy out there to come here and work for me\u2014\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does the block tower fall down?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Lessing removed his helmet.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Unknown.
