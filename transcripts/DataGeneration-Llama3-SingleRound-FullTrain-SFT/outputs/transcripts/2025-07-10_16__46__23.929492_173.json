      "background_text": "SPACEMAN ON A SPREE BY MACK REYNOLDS\n\n\n Illustrated by Nodel\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of Tomorrow June 1963\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] What's more important\u2014Man's conquest\n\n of space, or one spaceman's life? I\n\n\n They gave him a gold watch. It was meant to be symbolical, of course.  In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the  timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its  quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by  power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free  swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\n\n\n They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such  bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting  Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody  from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were  pseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travel  nor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother to  remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned  up at all.\n\n\n In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations  before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible  in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to  his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\n\n\n The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them  back. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him  through decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards.  But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had  plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited  crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or  three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\n\n\n He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the  Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long  haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of  space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,  boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one  room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in  autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to  find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like  Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a  mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy  beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\n\n\n No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and  made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There  wasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to  keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He  was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking  about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\n\n\n They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn. The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was  typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,  Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America  who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against  having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his  eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\n\n\n That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans  Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced  Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more  courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under  the Ultrawelfare State.\n\n\n Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,  Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more  bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to  the cloddy's patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have  miserably failed.\"\n\n\n Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn't call Seymour Pond a cloddy.  In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\n\n\n \"That's nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take  Pond's place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has  been trained. There aren't two men on North America\u2014there aren't two  men in the world!\u2014who better realize the urgency of continuing our  delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of  us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the  road to his destiny.\"\n\n\n His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot  training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn't.\"\n\n\n \"At that time there wasn't such a blistering percentage of funkers  throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could  foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to  lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face  adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our  ancestors did?\"\n\n\n Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea  and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the  present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one's  way of life in the comfort of one's home than to be confronted with  the unpleasantness of facing nature's dangers in more adventurous  pastimes.\"\n\n\n Gubelin, half angry at his friend's argument, leaned forward to snap  rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face  reality, Lofting. Don't require or expect from Seymour Pond more  than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our  Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb  security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our  society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,  clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level  of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted  into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the  population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude  dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was  you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out  the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six  trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable  life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the  very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.  He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years  of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he  made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was  drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now  free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to  our pleas for a few more trips?\"\n\n\n \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\" Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,  seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off  the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken  man.\n\n\n He said, \"No, he hasn't. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has  always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in  actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to  the least dangerous path. Today we've reached the point where no one  need face danger\u2014ever. There are few who don't take advantage of the  fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\n\n\n His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let's  leave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to the  point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will  take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate  pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next  explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been  increasingly hard to come by\u2014even though in our minds, Hans, we are  near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so  spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take  hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated  to the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well be  that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies  on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space  Exploration.\"\n\n\n \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\n\n\n \"So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\n\n\n \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.  Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his  face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends  justify the means?\"\n\n\n Gubelin blinked at him.\n\n\n The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have  failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven't you ever read  of the sailor and his way of life?\"\n\n\n \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to  do with it?\"\n\n\n \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more  than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,  tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never  heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his  birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at  sea\u2014and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out  for years at a stretch before returning to home port\u2014he would talk  of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be  one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and  heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning  would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in  jail. So back to sea he'd have to go.\"\n\n\n Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor  can't be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I'd  personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over  the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\n\n\n He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his  universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.  \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,  nobody can, ah, con you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever  our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\n\n\n The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern  methods, my dear chap.\" II\n\n\n Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any  excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age  of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn't  been a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have his  name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\n\n\n When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications  were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in  the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training  for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had  taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed  the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It  had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty  take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\n\n\n Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,  a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of  dangers met and passed.\n\n\n Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented  him from ever being called up for contributing to the country's labor  needs again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer.\n\n\n He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn't  any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get the  reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the  fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or  not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn't you? What else did  you need?\n\n\n It had come as a surprise when he'd been drafted for the labor force.\n\n\n In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake  in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.  They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of  working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.  It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working  but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It  became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in  thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was  to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none  of them ever really becoming efficient.\n\n\n The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain  unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of  unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a  reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year  and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees  were needed, a draft lottery was held.\n\n\n All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you  were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen  might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were  granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks  they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the  dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be  sold for a lump sum on the market.\n\n\n Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own  vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most  of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was  obviously called for.\n\n\n He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He'd  accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended  to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card  was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he  wasn't going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\n\n\n Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,  fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third  rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you'd been in the  classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for  all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\n\n\n Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the  centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to  the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage's  profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets  quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who  must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and  usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent  hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long  denied him.\n\n\n Si was going to do it differently this time.\n\n\n Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The  works. But nothing but the best. To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable  retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he  attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.  A bit of prestige didn't hurt you when you went out on the town. In  the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever  performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren't  needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,  titles.\n\n\n Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit  card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the  auto-apartment's teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the  screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\n\n\n In a moment, the teevee-phone's robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of  Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four  thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents  apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The  screen went dead.\n\n\n One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely  spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it  would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he  wouldn't have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond  was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\n\n\n He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube  two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down  the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one  place really made sense. The big city.\n\n\n He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore  and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He  might as well do it up brown.\n\n\n He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his  car's dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot  controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his  destination, he dialed the vehicle's teevee-phone for information on  the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry  he'd read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity  gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car's destination dial.\n\n\n \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\n\n\n The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the  shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could  refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the  direction of the pressure was reversed.\n\n\n Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing  sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the  canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\n\n\n A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present  your credit card within ten minutes.\"\n\n\n Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most  swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size  the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to  the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the  Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched  the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\n\n\n He didn't take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining  table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,  he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn't plan to dine  or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he  managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\n\n\n He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped  himself happily onto the bed. It wasn't up to the degree of softness  he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that  direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the  mattress.\n\n\n He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it  fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it  against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that  registration could be completed.\n\n\n For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it  easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars  around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.  This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in  the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\n\n\n He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink  at the hotel's famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a  dime a dozen.\n\n\n He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,  \"Kudos Room.\"\n\n\n The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\" At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a  moment and looked about. He'd never been in a place like this, either.  However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was  going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made  his way to the bar.\n\n\n There was actually a bartender.\n\n\n Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an  air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed  they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.  He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the  drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so  as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\n\n\n Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he'd  dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining  conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up  to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to  take a look at the others present.\n\n\n To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None  that he placed, at least\u2014top teevee stars, top politicians of the  Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\n\n\n He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl  who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked  and then swallowed.\n\n\n \" Zo-ro-as-ter ,\" he breathed.\n\n\n She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of  having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her  eyes. Every pore, but every pore, was in place. She sat with the easy  grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\n\n\n His stare couldn't be ignored.\n\n\n She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far  Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the  Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\n\n\n There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about  building the drink.\n\n\n Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be  on me?\"\n\n\n Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her  Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\n\n\n The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\n\n\n The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn't that a  space pin?\"\n\n\n Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\n\n\n \"Good Heavens, you're a spaceman?\"\n\n\n \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can't wear one unless you  been on at least a Moon run.\"\n\n\n She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,  \"you're Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave  you.\"\n\n\n Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me  Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\n\n\n She said, \"I'm Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting  Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\n\n\n \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he'd never seen anything  like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the  current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.  \"I been called Si so long, I don't even know who somebody's talking to  if they say Seymour.\"\n\n\n \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone  such that it was obvious she hadn't quite adjusted as yet to having  met him.\n\n\n Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of  bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under  him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\n\n\n \" Academician Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him Doc ?\"\n\n\n Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don't have  much time for formality. Everybody's just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like  that. But how come you cried?\" She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,  as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech  Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in  your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the  planets....\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\n\n\n \"... and he said all those things about man's conquest of space. And  the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact  that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole  world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\n\n\n Si grunted. \"Yeah. That's all part of the Doc's scheme to get me to  take on another three runs. They're afraid the whole department'll be  dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning  Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,  it'd take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.  So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they're both trying to  pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration  Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their  ships. It's kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those  spaceships costs?\"\n\n\n \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don't think it's funny at all.\"\n\n\n Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\n\n\n Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I'd love to have a drink with you, Mr....\" \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of  the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you  know so much about it? You don't meet many people who are interested  in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.  Think it's kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of  materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\n\n\n Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I've been a space fan all my life. I've  read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots  and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you'd  say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\n\n\n Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it's kind of funny. I was  never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested  after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\n\n\n She frowned. \"I don't believe I know much about that.\"\n\n\n Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had  ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin  keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper  articles. Says there's enough adverse publicity about space exploration  already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship's crammed  tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there's  precious little room in the conning tower and you're the only man  aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there's a whole  flock of people aboard, there won't be any such thing as space cafard,  but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond's mouth began to tic  and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.

I\n\n\n They gave him a gold watch. It was meant to be symbolical, of course.  In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the  timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its  quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by  power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free  swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\n\n\n They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such  bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting  Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody  from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were  pseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travel  nor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother to  remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned  up at all.\n\n\n In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations  before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible  in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to  his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\n\n\n The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them  back. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him  through decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards.  But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had  plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited  crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or  three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\n\n\n He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the  Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long  haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of  space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,  boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one  room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in  autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to  find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like  Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a  mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy  beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\n\n\n No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and  made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There  wasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to  keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He  was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking  about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\n\n\n They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn. The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was  typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,  Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America  who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against  having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his  eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\n\n\n That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans  Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced  Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more  courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under  the Ultrawelfare State.\n\n\n Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,  Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more  bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to  the cloddy's patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have  miserably failed.\"\n\n\n Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn't call Seymour Pond a cloddy.  In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\n\n\n \"That's nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take  Pond's place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has  been trained. There aren't two men on North America\u2014there aren't two  men in the world!\u2014who better realize the urgency of continuing our  delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of  us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the  road to his destiny.\"\n\n\n His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot  training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn't.\"\n\n\n \"At that time there wasn't such a blistering percentage of funkers  throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could  foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to  lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face  adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our  ancestors did?\"\n\n\n Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea  and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the  present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one's  way of life in the comfort of one's home than to be confronted with  the unpleasantness of facing nature's dangers in more adventurous  pastimes.\"\n\n\n Gubelin, half angry at his friend's argument, leaned forward to snap  rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face  reality, Lofting. Don't require or expect from Seymour Pond more  than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our  Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb  security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our  society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,  clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level  of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted  into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the  population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude  dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was  you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out  the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six  trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable  life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the  very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.  He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years  of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he  made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was  drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now  free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to  our pleas for a few more trips?\"\n\n\n \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\" Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,  seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off  the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken  man.\n\n\n He said, \"No, he hasn't. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has  always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in  actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to  the least dangerous path. Today we've reached the point where no one  need face danger\u2014ever. There are few who don't take advantage of the  fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\n\n\n His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let's  leave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to the  point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will  take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate  pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next  explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been  increasingly hard to come by\u2014even though in our minds, Hans, we are  near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so  spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take  hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated  to the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well be  that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies  on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space  Exploration.\"\n\n\n \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\n\n\n \"So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\n\n\n \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.  Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his  face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends  justify the means?\"\n\n\n Gubelin blinked at him.\n\n\n The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have  failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven't you ever read  of the sailor and his way of life?\"\n\n\n \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to  do with it?\"\n\n\n \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more  than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,  tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never  heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his  birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at  sea\u2014and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out  for years at a stretch before returning to home port\u2014he would talk  of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be  one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and  heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning  would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in  jail. So back to sea he'd have to go.\"\n\n\n Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor  can't be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I'd  personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over  the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\n\n\n He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his  universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.  \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,  nobody can, ah, con you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever  our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\n\n\n The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern  methods, my dear chap.\" II\n\n\n Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any  excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age  of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn't  been a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have his  name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\n\n\n When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications  were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in  the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training  for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had  taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed  the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It  had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty  take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\n\n\n Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,  a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of  dangers met and passed.\n\n\n Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented  him from ever being called up for contributing to the country's labor  needs again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer.\n\n\n He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn't  any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get the  reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the  fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or  not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn't you? What else did  you need?\n\n\n It had come as a surprise when he'd been drafted for the labor force.\n\n\n In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake  in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.  They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of  working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.  It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working  but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It  became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in  thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was  to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none  of them ever really becoming efficient.\n\n\n The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain  unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of  unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a  reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year  and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees  were needed, a draft lottery was held.\n\n\n All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you  were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen  might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were  granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks  they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the  dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be  sold for a lump sum on the market.\n\n\n Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own  vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most  of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was  obviously called for.\n\n\n He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He'd  accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended  to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card  was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he  wasn't going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\n\n\n Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,  fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third  rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you'd been in the  classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for  all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\n\n\n Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the  centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to  the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage's  profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets  quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who  must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and  usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent  hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long  denied him.\n\n\n Si was going to do it differently this time.\n\n\n Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The  works. But nothing but the best. To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable  retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he  attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.  A bit of prestige didn't hurt you when you went out on the town. In  the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever  performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren't  needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,  titles.\n\n\n Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit  card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the  auto-apartment's teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the  screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\n\n\n In a moment, the teevee-phone's robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of  Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four  thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents  apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The  screen went dead.\n\n\n One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely  spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it  would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he  wouldn't have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond  was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\n\n\n He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube  two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down  the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one  place really made sense. The big city.\n\n\n He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore  and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He  might as well do it up brown.\n\n\n He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his  car's dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot  controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his  destination, he dialed the vehicle's teevee-phone for information on  the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry  he'd read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity  gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car's destination dial.\n\n\n \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\n\n\n The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the  shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could  refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the  direction of the pressure was reversed.\n\n\n Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing  sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the  canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\n\n\n A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present  your credit card within ten minutes.\"\n\n\n Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most  swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size  the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to  the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the  Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched  the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\n\n\n He didn't take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining  table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,  he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn't plan to dine  or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he  managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\n\n\n He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped  himself happily onto the bed. It wasn't up to the degree of softness  he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that  direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the  mattress.\n\n\n He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it  fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it  against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that  registration could be completed.\n\n\n For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it  easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars  around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.  This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in  the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\n\n\n He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink  at the hotel's famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a  dime a dozen.\n\n\n He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,  \"Kudos Room.\"\n\n\n The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\" At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a  moment and looked about. He'd never been in a place like this, either.  However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was  going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made  his way to the bar.\n\n\n There was actually a bartender.\n\n\n Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an  air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed  they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.  He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the  drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so  as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\n\n\n Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he'd  dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining  conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up  to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to  take a look at the others present.\n\n\n To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None  that he placed, at least\u2014top teevee stars, top politicians of the  Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\n\n\n He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl  who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked  and then swallowed.\n\n\n \" Zo-ro-as-ter ,\" he breathed.\n\n\n She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of  having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her  eyes. Every pore, but every pore, was in place. She sat with the easy  grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\n\n\n His stare couldn't be ignored.\n\n\n She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far  Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the  Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\n\n\n There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about  building the drink.\n\n\n Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be  on me?\"\n\n\n Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her  Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\n\n\n The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\n\n\n The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn't that a  space pin?\"\n\n\n Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\n\n\n \"Good Heavens, you're a spaceman?\"\n\n\n \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can't wear one unless you  been on at least a Moon run.\"\n\n\n She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,  \"you're Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave  you.\"\n\n\n Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me  Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\n\n\n She said, \"I'm Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting  Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\n\n\n \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he'd never seen anything  like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the  current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.  \"I been called Si so long, I don't even know who somebody's talking to  if they say Seymour.\"\n\n\n \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone  such that it was obvious she hadn't quite adjusted as yet to having  met him.\n\n\n Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of  bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under  him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\n\n\n \" Academician Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him Doc ?\"\n\n\n Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don't have  much time for formality. Everybody's just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like  that. But how come you cried?\" She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,  as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech  Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in  your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the  planets....\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\n\n\n \"... and he said all those things about man's conquest of space. And  the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact  that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole  world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\n\n\n Si grunted. \"Yeah. That's all part of the Doc's scheme to get me to  take on another three runs. They're afraid the whole department'll be  dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning  Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,  it'd take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.  So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they're both trying to  pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration  Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their  ships. It's kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those  spaceships costs?\"\n\n\n \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don't think it's funny at all.\"\n\n\n Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\n\n\n Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I'd love to have a drink with you, Mr....\" \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of  the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you  know so much about it? You don't meet many people who are interested  in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.  Think it's kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of  materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\n\n\n Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I've been a space fan all my life. I've  read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots  and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you'd  say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\n\n\n Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it's kind of funny. I was  never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested  after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\n\n\n She frowned. \"I don't believe I know much about that.\"\n\n\n Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had  ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin  keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper  articles. Says there's enough adverse publicity about space exploration  already. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship's crammed  tight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there's  precious little room in the conning tower and you're the only man  aboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there's a whole  flock of people aboard, there won't be any such thing as space cafard,  but....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond's mouth began to tic  and he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat happens to drafted workers?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They train and work for a time, then retire with extra funds.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They work a short period of time, then return to normal life.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They work a short period of time, then return to normal life.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They work a short period of time, then return to normal life.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

I\n\n\n They gave him a gold watch. It was meant to be symbolical, of course.  In the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the  timepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its  quaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by  power-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free  swinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\n\n\n They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such  bigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting  Gubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody  from the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were  pseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travel  nor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother to  remember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned  up at all.\n\n\n In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations  before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible  in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to  his portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\n\n\n The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them  back. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him  through decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards.  But Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had  plenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited  crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or  three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\n\n\n He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the  Moon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long  haul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of  space cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,  boredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one  room mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in  autobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to  find contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like  Doc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a  mini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy  beyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\n\n\n No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and  made a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There  wasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to  keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He  was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking  about it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\n\n\n They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn. The gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was  typical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,  Academician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America  who still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against  having his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his  eyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\n\n\n That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans  Girard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced  Gubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more  courage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under  the Ultrawelfare State.\n\n\n Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,  Lofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more  bright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to  the cloddy's patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have  miserably failed.\"\n\n\n Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn't call Seymour Pond a cloddy.  In his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\n\n\n \"That's nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take  Pond's place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has  been trained. There aren't two men on North America\u2014there aren't two  men in the world!\u2014who better realize the urgency of continuing our  delving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of  us would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the  road to his destiny.\"\n\n\n His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot  training forty years ago, Lofting. We didn't.\"\n\n\n \"At that time there wasn't such a blistering percentage of funkers  throughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could  foresee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to  lack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face  adventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our  ancestors did?\"\n\n\n Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea  and tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the  present generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one's  way of life in the comfort of one's home than to be confronted with  the unpleasantness of facing nature's dangers in more adventurous  pastimes.\"\n\n\n Gubelin, half angry at his friend's argument, leaned forward to snap  rebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face  reality, Lofting. Don't require or expect from Seymour Pond more  than is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our  Ultrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb  security by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our  society that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,  clothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level  of subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted  into industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the  population is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude  dossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was  you yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out  the more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six  trips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable  life than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the  very few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.  He was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years  of drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he  made his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was  drafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now  free from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to  our pleas for a few more trips?\"\n\n\n \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\" Girard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,  seemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off  the conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken  man.\n\n\n He said, \"No, he hasn't. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has  always paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in  actuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to  the least dangerous path. Today we've reached the point where no one  need face danger\u2014ever. There are few who don't take advantage of the  fact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\n\n\n His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let's  leave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to the  point. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will  take months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate  pilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next  explorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been  increasingly hard to come by\u2014even though in our minds, Hans, we are  near important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so  spark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take  hold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated  to the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well be  that the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies  on Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space  Exploration.\"\n\n\n \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\n\n\n \"So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\n\n\n \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.  Looking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his  face took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends  justify the means?\"\n\n\n Gubelin blinked at him.\n\n\n The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have  failed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven't you ever read  of the sailor and his way of life?\"\n\n\n \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to  do with it?\"\n\n\n \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more  than a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,  tendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never  heard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his  birth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at  sea\u2014and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out  for years at a stretch before returning to home port\u2014he would talk  of his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be  one short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and  heading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning  would find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in  jail. So back to sea he'd have to go.\"\n\n\n Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor  can't be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I'd  personally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over  the head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\n\n\n He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his  universal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.  \"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,  nobody can, ah, con you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever  our present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\n\n\n The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern  methods, my dear chap.\" II\n\n\n Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any  excuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age  of twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn't  been a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have his  name pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\n\n\n When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications  were such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in  the Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training  for space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had  taken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed  the finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It  had been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty  take-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\n\n\n Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,  a bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of  dangers met and passed.\n\n\n Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented  him from ever being called up for contributing to the country's labor  needs again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer.\n\n\n He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn't  any particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get the  reputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the  fellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or  not. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn't you? What else did  you need?\n\n\n It had come as a surprise when he'd been drafted for the labor force.\n\n\n In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake  in adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.  They had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of  working hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.  It finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working  but two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It  became obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in  thirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was  to have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none  of them ever really becoming efficient.\n\n\n The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain  unemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of  unemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a  reasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year  and a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees  were needed, a draft lottery was held.\n\n\n All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you  were drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen  might feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were  granted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks  they fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the  dividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be  sold for a lump sum on the market.\n\n\n Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own  vacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most  of his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was  obviously called for.\n\n\n He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He'd  accumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended  to blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card  was burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he  wasn't going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\n\n\n Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,  fell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third  rate groggery where you spent just as much as though you'd been in the  classiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for  all the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\n\n\n Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the  centuries since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to  the tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage's  profits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets  quite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who  must leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and  usually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent  hurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long  denied him.\n\n\n Si was going to do it differently this time.\n\n\n Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The  works. But nothing but the best. To start off, he dressed with great care in the honorable  retirement-rank suit he had so recently purchased. His space pin he  attached carefully to the lapel. That was a good beginning, he decided.  A bit of prestige didn't hurt you when you went out on the town. In  the Ultrawelfare State hardly one person in a hundred actually ever  performed anything of value to society. The efforts of most weren't  needed. Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,  titles.\n\n\n Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit  card was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the  auto-apartment's teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the  screen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\n\n\n In a moment, the teevee-phone's robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of  Inalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four  thousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents  apiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The  screen went dead.\n\n\n One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely  spend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it  would. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he  wouldn't have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond  was as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\n\n\n He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube  two-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down  the canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one  place really made sense. The big city.\n\n\n He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore  and Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He  might as well do it up brown.\n\n\n He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his  car's dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot  controls, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his  destination, he dialed the vehicle's teevee-phone for information on  the hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry  he'd read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity  gossip reporters, and dialed it on the car's destination dial.\n\n\n \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\n\n\n The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the  shot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could  refrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the  direction of the pressure was reversed.\n\n\n Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing  sub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the  canopy and stepped into his hotel room.\n\n\n A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present  your credit card within ten minutes.\"\n\n\n Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most  swank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size  the guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to  the full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the  Empire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched  the all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\n\n\n He didn't take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining  table, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,  he well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn't plan to dine  or do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he  managed to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\n\n\n He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped  himself happily onto the bed. It wasn't up to the degree of softness  he presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that  direction so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the  mattress.\n\n\n He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it  fell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it  against the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that  registration could be completed.\n\n\n For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it  easy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars  around in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.  This time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in  the grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\n\n\n He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink  at the hotel's famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a  dime a dozen.\n\n\n He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,  \"Kudos Room.\"\n\n\n The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\" At the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a  moment and looked about. He'd never been in a place like this, either.  However, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was  going to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made  his way to the bar.\n\n\n There was actually a bartender.\n\n\n Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an  air of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed  they had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.  He put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the  drink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so  as to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\n\n\n Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he'd  dreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining  conning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up  to his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to  take a look at the others present.\n\n\n To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None  that he placed, at least\u2014top teevee stars, top politicians of the  Ultrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\n\n\n He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl  who occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked  and then swallowed.\n\n\n \" Zo-ro-as-ter ,\" he breathed.\n\n\n She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of  having cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her  eyes. Every pore, but every pore, was in place. She sat with the easy  grace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\n\n\n His stare couldn't be ignored.\n\n\n She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far  Out Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the  Kudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\n\n\n There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about  building the drink.\n\n\n Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be  on me?\"\n\n\n Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her  Oriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\n\n\n The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\n\n\n The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn't that a  space pin?\"\n\n\n Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\n\n\n \"Good Heavens, you're a spaceman?\"\n\n\n \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can't wear one unless you  been on at least a Moon run.\"\n\n\n She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,  \"you're Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave  you.\"\n\n\n Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me  Si,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\n\n\n She said, \"I'm Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting  Seymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\n\n\n \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he'd never seen anything  like this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the  current sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.  \"I been called Si so long, I don't even know who somebody's talking to  if they say Seymour.\"\n\n\n \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone  such that it was obvious she hadn't quite adjusted as yet to having  met him.\n\n\n Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of  bored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under  him in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\n\n\n \" Academician Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him Doc ?\"\n\n\n Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don't have  much time for formality. Everybody's just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like  that. But how come you cried?\" She looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,  as though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech  Doctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in  your space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the  planets....\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\n\n\n \"... and he said all those things about man's conquest of space. And  the dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact  that you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole  world trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\n\n\n Si grunted. \"Yeah. That's all part of the Doc's scheme to get me to  take on another three runs. They're afraid the whole department'll be  dropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning  Board. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,  it'd take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.  So old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they're both trying to  pressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration  Department, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their  ships. It's kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those  spaceships costs?\"\n\n\n \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don't think it's funny at all.\"\n\n\n Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\n\n\n Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I'd love to have a drink with you, Mr....\" \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of  the hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you  know so much about it? You don't meet many people who are interested  in space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.  Think it's kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of  materials and all and keep the economy going.\"\n\n\n Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I've been a space fan all my life. I've  read all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots  and everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you'd  say I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\n\n\n Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it's kind of funny. I was  never much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested  after my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\n\n\n She frowned. \"I don't believe I know much about that.\"\n\n\n Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had  ever talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin  keeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper  articles.
