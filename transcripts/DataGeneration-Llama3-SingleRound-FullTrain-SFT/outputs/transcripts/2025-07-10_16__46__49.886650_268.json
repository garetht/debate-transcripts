      "background_text": "THE\n\n HUNTED\n\n HEROES By ROBERT SILVERBERG The planet itself was tough enough\u2014barren, desolate,  forbidding; enough to stop the most adventurous and  dedicated. But they had to run head-on against a mad  genius who had a motto: Death to all Terrans! \"Let's  keep moving,\" I told  Val. \"The surest way to  die out here on Mars is to  give up.\" I reached over and  turned up the pressure on her  oxymask to make things a  little easier for her. Through  the glassite of the mask, I  could see her face contorted  in an agony of fatigue.\n\n\n And she probably thought  the failure of the sandcat was  all my fault, too. Val's usually  about the best wife a guy  could ask for, but when she  wants to be she can be a real  flying bother.\n\n\n It was beyond her to see  that some grease monkey back  at the Dome was at fault\u2014whoever  it was who had failed  to fasten down the engine  hood. Nothing but what had  stopped us could stop a sandcat:  sand in the delicate  mechanism of the atomic engine.\n\n\n But no; she blamed it all on  me somehow: So we were out  walking on the spongy sand  of the Martian desert. We'd  been walking a good eight  hours.\n\n\n \"Can't we turn back now,  Ron?\" Val pleaded. \"Maybe  there isn't any uranium in  this sector at all. I think  we're crazy to keep on searching  out here!\"\n\n\n I started to tell her that the  UranCo chief had assured me  we'd hit something out this  way, but changed my mind.  When Val's tired and overwrought  there's no sense in  arguing with her.\n\n\n I stared ahead at the bleak,  desolate wastes of the Martian  landscape. Behind us  somewhere was the comfort  of the Dome, ahead nothing  but the mazes and gullies of  this dead world. He was a cripple in a wheelchair\u2014helpless as a rattlesnake. \"Try to keep going, Val.\"  My gloved hand reached out  and clumsily enfolded hers.  \"Come on, kid. Remember\u2014we're  doing this for Earth.  We're heroes.\"\n\n\n She glared at me. \"Heroes,  hell!\" she muttered. \"That's  the way it looked back home,  but, out there it doesn't seem  so glorious. And UranCo's  pay is stinking.\"\n\n\n \"We didn't come out here  for the pay, Val.\"\n\n\n \"I know, I know, but just  the same\u2014\"\n\n\n It must have been hell for  her. We had wandered fruitlessly  over the red sands all  day, both of us listening for  the clicks of the counter. And  the geigers had been obstinately  hushed all day, except  for their constant undercurrent  of meaningless noises.\n\n\n Even though the Martian  gravity was only a fraction of  Earth's, I was starting to  tire, and I knew it must have  been really rough on Val with  her lovely but unrugged legs.\n\n\n \"Heroes,\" she said bitterly.  \"We're not heroes\u2014we're  suckers! Why did I ever let  you volunteer for the Geig  Corps and drag me along?\"\n\n\n Which wasn't anywhere  close to the truth. Now I  knew she was at the breaking  point, because Val didn't lie  unless she was so exhausted  she didn't know what she was  doing. She had been just as  much inflamed by the idea of  coming to Mars to help in the  search for uranium as I was.  We knew the pay was poor,  but we had felt it a sort of  obligation, something we  could do as individuals to  keep the industries of radioactives-starved  Earth going.  And we'd always had a roving  foot, both of us.\n\n\n No, we had decided together  to come to Mars\u2014the  way we decided together on  everything. Now she was  turning against me. I tried to jolly her. \"Buck  up, kid,\" I said. I didn't dare  turn up her oxy pressure any  higher, but it was obvious she  couldn't keep going. She was  almost sleep-walking now.\n\n\n We pressed on over the  barren terrain. The geiger  kept up a fairly steady click-pattern,  but never broke into  that sudden explosive tumult  that meant we had found pay-dirt.  I started to feel tired  myself, terribly tired. I longed  to lie down on the soft,  spongy Martian sand and  bury myself.\n\n\n I looked at Val. She was  dragging along with her eyes  half-shut. I felt almost guilty  for having dragged her out to  Mars, until I recalled that I  hadn't. In fact, she had come  up with the idea before I did.  I wished there was some way  of turning the weary, bedraggled  girl at my side back into  the Val who had so enthusiastically  suggested we join  the Geigs.\n\n\n Twelve steps later, I decided  this was about as far as  we could go.\n\n\n I stopped, slipped out of  the geiger harness, and lowered  myself ponderously to  the ground. \"What'samatter,  Ron?\" Val asked sleepily.  \"Something wrong?\"\n\n\n \"No, baby,\" I said, putting  out a hand and taking hers.  \"I think we ought to rest a  little before we go any further.  It's been a long, hard  day.\"\n\n\n It didn't take much to persuade  her. She slid down beside  me, curled up, and in a  moment she was fast asleep,  sprawled out on the sands. Poor kid , I thought. Maybe  we shouldn't have come to  Mars after all. But, I reminded  myself, someone had to do  the job.\n\n\n A second thought appeared,  but I squelched it:\n\n\n Why the hell me?\n\n\n I looked down at Valerie's  sleeping form, and thought of  our warm, comfortable little  home on Earth. It wasn't  much, but people in love don't  need very fancy surroundings.\n\n\n I watched her, sleeping  peacefully, a wayward lock of  her soft blonde hair trailing  down over one eyebrow, and  it seemed hard to believe that  we'd exchanged Earth and all  it held for us for the raw, untamed  struggle that was Mars.  But I knew I'd do it again, if  I had the chance. It's because  we wanted to keep what we  had. Heroes? Hell, no. We  just liked our comforts, and  wanted to keep them. Which  took a little work. Time to get moving. But  then Val stirred and rolled  over in her sleep, and I didn't  have the heart to wake her. I  sat there, holding her, staring  out over the desert, watching  the wind whip the sand up  into weird shapes.\n\n\n The Geig Corps preferred  married couples, working in  teams. That's what had finally  decided it for us\u2014we were a  good team. We had no ties on  Earth that couldn't be broken  without much difficulty. So  we volunteered. And here we are. Heroes.  The wind blasted a mass of  sand into my face, and I felt  it tinkle against the oxymask.\n\n\n I glanced at the suit-chronometer.  Getting late. I decided  once again to wake Val.  But she was tired. And I was  tired too, tired from our  wearying journey across the  empty desert.\n\n\n I started to shake Val. But  I never finished. It would be so nice just to lean back and  nuzzle up to her, down in the  sand. So nice. I yawned, and  stretched back. I awoke with a sudden startled  shiver, and realized angrily  I had let myself doze off.  \"Come on, Val,\" I said savagely,  and started to rise to  my feet.\n\n\n I couldn't.\n\n\n I looked down. I was neatly  bound in thin, tough, plastic  tangle-cord, swathed from  chin to boot-bottoms, my  arms imprisoned, my feet  caught. And tangle-cord is  about as easy to get out of as  a spider's web is for a trapped  fly.\n\n\n It wasn't Martians that  had done it. There weren't  any Martians, hadn't been for  a million years. It was some  Earthman who had bound us.\n\n\n I rolled my eyes toward  Val, and saw that she was  similarly trussed in the sticky  stuff. The tangle-cord was still  fresh, giving off a faint, repugnant  odor like that of drying  fish. It had been spun on  us only a short time ago, I  realized.\n\n\n \"Ron\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't try to move, baby.  This stuff can break your  neck if you twist it wrong.\"  She continued for a moment  to struggle futilely, and I had  to snap, \"Lie still, Val!\"\n\n\n \"A very wise statement,\"  said a brittle, harsh voice  from above me. I looked up  and saw a helmeted figure  above us. He wasn't wearing  the customary skin-tight pliable  oxysuits we had. He  wore an outmoded, bulky  spacesuit and a fishbowl helmet,  all but the face area  opaque. The oxygen cannisters  weren't attached to his  back as expected, though.  They were strapped to the  back of the wheelchair in  which he sat.\n\n\n Through the fishbowl I  could see hard little eyes, a  yellowed, parchment-like face,  a grim-set jaw. I didn't recognize  him, and this struck me  odd. I thought I knew everyone  on sparsely-settled Mars.  Somehow I'd missed him.\n\n\n What shocked me most was  that he had no legs. The  spacesuit ended neatly at the  thighs.\n\n\n He was holding in his left  hand the tanglegun with  which he had entrapped us,  and a very efficient-looking  blaster was in his right.\n\n\n \"I didn't want to disturb  your sleep,\" he said coldly.  \"So I've been waiting here  for you to wake up.\"\n\n\n I could just see it. He might  have been sitting there for  hours, complacently waiting  to see how we'd wake up.  That was when I realized he  must be totally insane. I could  feel my stomach-muscles  tighten, my throat constrict  painfully.\n\n\n Then anger ripped through  me, washing away the terror.  \"What's going on?\" I demanded,  staring at the half  of a man who confronted us  from the wheelchair. \"Who  are you?\"\n\n\n \"You'll find out soon  enough,\" he said. \"Suppose  now you come with me.\" He  reached for the tanglegun,  flipped the little switch on its  side to MELT, and shot a  stream of watery fluid over  our legs, keeping the blaster  trained on us all the while.  Our legs were free.\n\n\n \"You may get up now,\" he  said. \"Slowly, without trying  to make trouble.\" Val and I  helped each other to our feet  as best we could, considering  our arms were still tightly  bound against the sides of our  oxysuits.\n\n\n \"Walk,\" the stranger said,  waving the tanglegun to indicate  the direction. \"I'll be  right behind you.\" He holstered  the tanglegun.\n\n\n I glimpsed the bulk of an  outboard atomic rigging behind  him, strapped to the  back of the wheelchair. He  fingered a knob on the arm of  the chair and the two exhaust  ducts behind the wheel-housings  flamed for a moment,  and the chair began to roll.\n\n\n Obediently, we started  walking. You don't argue  with a blaster, even if the  man pointing it is in a wheelchair. \"What's going on, Ron?\"  Val asked in a low voice as we  walked. Behind us the wheelchair  hissed steadily.\n\n\n \"I don't quite know, Val.  I've never seen this guy before,  and I thought I knew  everyone at the Dome.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet up there!\" our captor  called, and we stopped  talking. We trudged along together,  with him following  behind; I could hear the crunch-crunch of the wheelchair  as its wheels chewed  into the sand. I wondered  where we were going, and  why. I wondered why we had  ever left Earth.\n\n\n The answer to that came to  me quick enough: we had to.  Earth needed radioactives,  and the only way to get them  was to get out and look. The  great atomic wars of the late  20th Century had used up  much of the supply, but the  amount used to blow up half  the great cities of the world  hardly compared with the  amount we needed to put  them back together again.\n\n\n In three centuries the shattered  world had been completely  rebuilt. The wreckage  of New York and Shanghai  and London and all the other  ruined cities had been hidden  by a shining new world of  gleaming towers and flying  roadways. We had profited by  our grandparents' mistakes.  They had used their atomics  to make bombs. We used ours  for fuel.\n\n\n It was an atomic world.  Everything: power drills,  printing presses, typewriters,  can openers, ocean liners,  powered by the inexhaustible  energy of the dividing atom.\n\n\n But though the energy is  inexhaustible, the supply of  nuclei isn't. After three centuries  of heavy consumption,  the supply failed. The mighty  machine that was Earth's industry  had started to slow  down.\n\n\n And that started the chain  of events that led Val and me  to end up as a madman's prisoners,  on Mars. With every  source of uranium mined dry  on Earth, we had tried other  possibilities. All sorts of  schemes came forth. Project  Sea-Dredge was trying to get  uranium from the oceans. In  forty or fifty years, they'd  get some results, we hoped.  But there wasn't forty or  fifty years' worth of raw stuff  to tide us over until then. In a  decade or so, our power would  be just about gone. I could  picture the sort of dog-eat-dog  world we'd revert back  to. Millions of starving, freezing  humans tooth-and-clawing  in it in the useless shell of  a great atomic civilization.\n\n\n So, Mars. There's not much  uranium on Mars, and it's not  easy to find or any cinch to  mine. But what little is there,  helps. It's a stopgap effort,  just to keep things moving  until Project Sea-Dredge  starts functioning.\n\n\n Enter the Geig Corps: volunteers  out on the face of  Mars, combing for its uranium  deposits.\n\n\n And here we are, I thought. After we walked on a  while, a Dome became visible  up ahead. It slid up over the  crest of a hill, set back between  two hummocks on the  desert. Just out of the way  enough to escape observation.\n\n\n For a puzzled moment I  thought it was our Dome, the  settlement where all of UranCo's  Geig Corps were located,  but another look told me that  this was actually quite near  us and fairly small. A one-man  Dome, of all things!\n\n\n \"Welcome to my home,\" he  said. \"The name is Gregory  Ledman.\" He herded us off to  one side of the airlock, uttered  a few words keyed to his  voice, and motioned us inside  when the door slid up. When  we were inside he reached up,  clumsily holding the blaster,  and unscrewed the ancient  spacesuit fishbowl.\n\n\n His face was a bitter,  dried-up mask. He was a man  who hated.\n\n\n The place was spartanly  furnished. No chairs, no tape-player,  no decoration of any  sort. Hard bulkhead walls,  rivet-studded, glared back  at us. He had an automatic  chef, a bed, and a writing-desk,  and no other furniture.\n\n\n Suddenly he drew the tanglegun  and sprayed our legs  again. We toppled heavily to  the floor. I looked up angrily. \"I imagine you want to  know the whole story,\" he  said. \"The others did, too.\"\n\n\n Valerie looked at me anxiously.  Her pretty face was a  dead white behind her oxymask.  \"What others?\"\n\n\n \"I never bothered to find  out their names,\" Ledman  said casually. \"They were  other Geigs I caught unawares,  like you, out on the  desert. That's the only sport I  have left\u2014Geig-hunting. Look  out there.\"\n\n\n He gestured through the  translucent skin of the Dome,  and I felt sick. There was a  little heap of bones lying  there, looking oddly bright  against the redness of the  sands. They were the dried,  parched skeletons of Earthmen.  Bits of cloth and plastic,  once oxymasks and suits, still  clung to them.\n\n\n Suddenly I remembered.  There had been a pattern  there all the time. We didn't  much talk about it; we chalked  it off as occupational hazards.  There had been a pattern  of disappearances on the desert.  I could think of six, eight  names now. None of them  had been particularly close  friends. You don't get time to  make close friends out here.  But we'd vowed it wouldn't  happen to us.\n\n\n It had.\n\n\n \"You've been hunting  Geigs?\" I asked. \" Why? What've they ever done to  you?\"\n\n\n He smiled, as calmly as if  I'd just praised his house-keeping.  \"Because I hate  you,\" he said blandly. \"I intend  to wipe every last one of  you out, one by one.\"\n\n\n I stared at him. I'd never  seen a man like this before; I  thought all his kind had died  at the time of the atomic  wars.\n\n\n I heard Val sob, \"He's a  madman!\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Ledman said evenly.  \"I'm quite sane, believe me.  But I'm determined to drive  the Geigs\u2014and UranCo\u2014off  Mars. Eventually I'll scare  you all away.\"\n\n\n \"Just pick us off in the desert?\"\n\n\n \"Exactly,\" replied Ledman.  \"And I have no fears of an  armed attack. This place is  well fortified. I've devoted  years to building it. And I'm  back against those hills. They  couldn't pry me out.\" He let  his pale hand run up into his  gnarled hair. \"I've devoted  years to this. Ever since\u2014ever  since I landed here on  Mars.\" \"What are you going to do  with us?\" Val finally asked,  after a long silence.\n\n\n He didn't smile this time.  \"Kill you,\" he told her. \"Not  your husband. I want him as  an envoy, to go back and tell  the others to clear off.\" He  rocked back and forth in his  wheelchair, toying with the  gleaming, deadly blaster in  his hand.\n\n\n We stared in horror. It was  a nightmare\u2014sitting there,  placidly rocking back and  forth, a nightmare.\n\n\n I found myself fervently  wishing I was back out there  on the infinitely safer desert.\n\n\n \"Do I shock you?\" he asked.  \"I shouldn't\u2014not when  you see my motives.\"\n\n\n \"We don't see them,\" I  snapped.\n\n\n \"Well, let me show you.  You're on Mars hunting uranium,  right? To mine and  ship the radioactives back to  Earth to keep the atomic engines  going. Right?\"\n\n\n I nodded over at our geiger  counters.\n\n\n \"We volunteered to come to  Mars,\" Val said irrelevantly.\n\n\n \"Ah\u2014two young heroes,\"  Ledman said acidly. \"How  sad. I could almost feel sorry  for you. Almost.\"\n\n\n \"Just what is it you're  after?\" I said, stalling, stalling.\n\n\n \"Atomics cost me my legs,\"  he said. \"You remember the  Sadlerville Blast?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Of course.\" And I did, too.  I'd never forget it. No one  would. How could I forget  that great accident\u2014killing  hundreds, injuring thousands  more, sterilizing forty miles  of Mississippi land\u2014when  the Sadlerville pile went up?\n\n\n \"I was there on business at  the time,\" Ledman said. \"I  represented Ledman Atomics.  I was there to sign a new  contract for my company.  You know who I am, now?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"I was fairly well shielded  when it happened. I never got  the contract, but I got a good  dose of radiation instead. Not  enough to kill me,\" he said.  \"Just enough to necessitate  the removal of\u2014\" he indicated  the empty space at his  thighs. \"So I got off lightly.\"  He gestured at the wheelchair  blanket.\n\n\n I still didn't understand.  \"But why kill us Geigs? We had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\n \"You're just in this by accident,\"  he said. \"You see, after  the explosion and the amputation,  my fellow-members on  the board of Ledman Atomics  decided that a semi-basket  case like myself was a poor  risk as Head of the Board,  and they took my company  away. All quite legal, I assure  you. They left me almost a  pauper!\" Then he snapped  the punchline at me.\n\n\n \"They renamed Ledman  Atomics. Who did you say you  worked for?\"\n\n\n I began, \"Uran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't bother. A more inventive  title than Ledman  Atomics, but not quite as  much heart, wouldn't you  say?\" He grinned. \"I saved  for years; then I came to  Mars, lost myself, built this  Dome, and swore to get even.  There's not a great deal of  uranium on this planet, but  enough to keep me in a style  to which, unfortunately, I'm  no longer accustomed.\" He consulted his wrist  watch. \"Time for my injection.\"  He pulled out the tanglegun  and sprayed us again,  just to make doubly certain.  \"That's another little souvenir  of Sadlerville. I'm short  on red blood corpuscles.\"\n\n\n He rolled over to a wall  table and fumbled in a container  among a pile of hypodermics.  \"There are other injections,  too. Adrenalin, insulin.  Others. The Blast turned  me into a walking pin-cushion.  But I'll pay it all  back,\" he said. He plunged  the needle into his arm.\n\n\n My eyes widened. It was  too nightmarish to be real. I  wasn't seriously worried  about his threat to wipe out  the entire Geig Corps, since  it was unlikely that one man  in a wheelchair could pick us  all off. No, it wasn't the  threat that disturbed me, so  much as the whole concept, so  strange to me, that the human  mind could be as warped  and twisted as Ledman's.\n\n\n I saw the horror on Val's  face, and I knew she felt the  same way I did.\n\n\n \"Do you really think you  can succeed?\" I taunted him.  \"Really think you can kill  every Earthman on Mars? Of  all the insane, cockeyed\u2014\"\n\n\n Val's quick, worried head-shake  cut me off. But Ledman  had felt my words, all right.\n\n\n \"Yes! I'll get even with  every one of you for taking  away my legs! If we hadn't  meddled with the atom in the  first place, I'd be as tall and  powerful as you, today\u2014instead  of a useless cripple in a  wheelchair.\"\n\n\n \"You're sick, Gregory Ledman,\"  Val said quietly.  \"You've conceived an impossible  scheme of revenge and  now you're taking it out on  innocent people who've done  nothing, nothing at all to you.  That's not sane!\"\n\n\n His eyes blazed. \"Who are  you to talk of sanity?\" Uneasily I caught Val's  glance from a corner of my  eye. Sweat was rolling down  her smooth forehead faster  than the auto-wiper could  swab it away.\n\n\n \"Why don't you do something?  What are you waiting  for, Ron?\"\n\n\n \"Easy, baby,\" I said. I  knew what our ace in the hole  was. But I had to get Ledman  within reach of me first.\n\n\n \"Enough,\" he said. \"I'm going  to turn you loose outside,  right after\u2014\"\n\n\n \" Get sick! \" I hissed to Val,  low. She began immediately  to cough violently, emitting  harsh, choking sobs. \"Can't  breathe!\" She began to yell,  writhing in her bonds.\n\n\n That did it. Ledman hadn't  much humanity left in him,  but there was a little. He lowered  the blaster a bit and  wheeled one-hand over to see  what was wrong with Val.  She continued to retch and  moan most horribly. It almost  convinced me. I saw Val's  pale, frightened face turn to  me.\n\n\n He approached and peered  down at her. He opened his  mouth to say something, and  at that moment I snapped my  leg up hard, tearing the tangle-cord  with a snicking rasp,  and kicked his wheelchair  over.\n\n\n The blaster went off, burning  a hole through the Dome  roof. The automatic sealers  glued-in instantly. Ledman  went sprawling helplessly out  into the middle of the floor,  the wheelchair upended next  to him, its wheels slowly revolving  in the air. The blaster  flew from his hands at the  impact of landing and spun  out near me. In one quick motion  I rolled over and covered  it with my body. Ledman clawed his way to  me with tremendous effort  and tried wildly to pry the  blaster out from under me,  but without success. I twisted  a bit, reached out with my  free leg, and booted him  across the floor. He fetched  up against the wall of the  Dome and lay there.\n\n\n Val rolled over to me.\n\n\n \"Now if I could get free of  this stuff,\" I said, \"I could get  him covered before he comes  to. But how?\"\n\n\n \"Teamwork,\" Val said. She  swivelled around on the floor  until her head was near my  boot. \"Push my oxymask off  with your foot, if you can.\"\n\n\n I searched for the clamp  and tried to flip it. No luck,  with my heavy, clumsy boot.  I tried again, and this time it  snapped open. I got the tip  of my boot in and pried upward.  The oxymask came off,  slowly, scraping a jagged red  scratch up the side of Val's  neck as it came.\n\n\n \"There,\" she breathed.  \"That's that.\"\n\n\n I looked uneasily at Ledman.  He was groaning and  beginning to stir.\n\n\n Val rolled on the floor and  her face lay near my right  arm. I saw what she had in  mind. She began to nibble the  vile-tasting tangle-cord, running  her teeth up and down  it until it started to give. She  continued unfailingly.\n\n\n Finally one strand snapped.  Then another. At last I  had enough use of my hand  to reach out and grasp the  blaster. Then I pulled myself  across the floor to Ledman,  removed the tanglegun, and  melted the remaining tangle-cord  off.\n\n\n My muscles were stiff and  bunched, and rising made me  wince. I turned and freed Val.  Then I turned and faced Ledman.\n\n\n \"I suppose you'll kill me  now,\" he said.\n\n\n \"No. That's the difference  between sane people and insane,\"  I told him. \"I'm not  going to kill you at all. I'm  going to see to it that you're  sent back to Earth.\"\n\n\n \" No! \" he shouted. \"No!  Anything but back there. I  don't want to face them again\u2014not  after what they did to  me\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not so loud,\" I broke in.  \"They'll help you on Earth.  They'll take all the hatred and  sickness out of you, and turn  you into a useful member of  society again.\"\n\n\n \"I hate Earthmen,\" he spat  out. \"I hate all of them.\"\n\n\n \"I know,\" I said sarcastically.  \"You're just all full of  hate. You hated us so much  that you couldn't bear to hang  around on Earth for as much  as a year after the Sadlerville  Blast. You had to take right  off for Mars without a moment's  delay, didn't you? You  hated Earth so much you had to leave.\"\n\n\n \"Why are you telling all  this to me?\"\n\n\n \"Because if you'd stayed  long enough, you'd have used  some of your pension money  to buy yourself a pair of prosthetic  legs, and then you  wouldn't need this wheelchair.\"\n\n\n Ledman scowled, and then  his face went belligerent  again. \"They told me I was  paralyzed below the waist.  That I'd never walk again,  even with prosthetic legs, because  I had no muscles to fit  them to.\"\n\n\n \"You left Earth too quickly,\"  Val said.\n\n\n \"It was the only way,\" he  protested. \"I had to get off\u2014\"\n\n\n \"She's right,\" I told him.  \"The atom can take away, but  it can give as well. Soon after  you left they developed atomic-powered prosthetics\u2014amazing  things, virtually robot  legs. All the survivors of  the Sadlerville Blast were  given the necessary replacement  limbs free of charge. All  except you. You were so sick  you had to get away from the  world you despised and come  here.\"\n\n\n \"You're lying,\" he said.  \"It's not true!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, but it is,\" Val smiled.\n\n\n I saw him wilt visibly, and  for a moment I almost felt  sorry for him, a pathetic legless  figure propped up against  the wall of the Dome at  blaster-point. But then I remembered  he'd killed twelve  Geigs\u2014or more\u2014and would  have added Val to the number  had he had the chance. \"You're a very sick man,  Ledman,\" I said. \"All this  time you could have been  happy, useful on Earth, instead  of being holed up here  nursing your hatred. You  might have been useful, on  Earth. But you decided to  channel everything out as revenge.\"\n\n\n \"I still don't believe it\u2014those  legs. I might have walked  again. No\u2014no, it's all a lie.  They told me I'd never walk,\"  he said, weakly but stubbornly  still.\n\n\n I could see his whole structure  of hate starting to topple,  and I decided to give it  the final push.\n\n\n \"Haven't you wondered  how I managed to break the  tangle-cord when I kicked you  over?\"\n\n\n \"Yes\u2014human legs aren't  strong enough to break tangle-cord  that way.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I said. I  gave Val the blaster and slipped  out of my oxysuit.  \"Look,\" I said. I pointed to  my smooth, gleaming metal  legs. The almost soundless  purr of their motors was the  only noise in the room. \"I was  in the Sadlerville Blast, too,\"  I said. \"But I didn't go crazy  with hate when I lost my legs.\"\n\n\n Ledman was sobbing.\n\n\n \"Okay, Ledman,\" I said.  Val got him into his suit, and  brought him the fishbowl helmet.  \"Get your helmet on and  let's go. Between the psychs  and the prosthetics men,  you'll be a new man inside of  a year.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm a murderer!\"\n\n\n \"That's right. And you'll be  sentenced to psych adjustment.  When they're finished,  Gregory Ledman the killer  will be as dead as if they'd  electrocuted you, but there'll  be a new\u2014and sane\u2014Gregory  Ledman.\" I turned to Val.\n\n\n \"Got the geigers, honey?\"\n\n\n For the first time since  Ledman had caught us, I remembered  how tired Val had  been out on the desert. I realized  now that I had been driving  her mercilessly\u2014me, with  my chromium legs and atomic-powered  muscles. No wonder  she was ready to fold!  And I'd been too dense to see  how unfair I had been.\n\n\n She lifted the geiger harnesses,  and I put Ledman  back in his wheelchair.\n\n\n Val slipped her oxymask  back on and fastened it shut.\n\n\n \"Let's get back to the Dome  in a hurry,\" I said. \"We'll  turn Ledman over to the authorities.  Then we can catch  the next ship for Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Go back? Go back? If you  think I'm backing down now  and quitting you can find  yourself another wife! After  we dump this guy I'm sacking  in for twenty hours, and then  we're going back out there to  finish that search-pattern.  Earth needs uranium, honey,  and I know you'd never be  happy quitting in the middle  like that.\" She smiled. \"I  can't wait to get out there  and start listening for those  tell-tale clicks.\"\n\n\n I gave a joyful whoop and  swung her around. When I  put her down, she squeezed  my hand, hard.\n\n\n \"Let's get moving, fellow  hero,\" she said.\n\n\n I pressed the stud for the  airlock, smiling.

But they had to run head-on against a mad  genius who had a motto: Death to all Terrans! \"Let's  keep moving,\" I told  Val. \"The surest way to  die out here on Mars is to  give up.\" I reached over and  turned up the pressure on her  oxymask to make things a  little easier for her. Through  the glassite of the mask, I  could see her face contorted  in an agony of fatigue.\n\n\n And she probably thought  the failure of the sandcat was  all my fault, too. Val's usually  about the best wife a guy  could ask for, but when she  wants to be she can be a real  flying bother.\n\n\n It was beyond her to see  that some grease monkey back  at the Dome was at fault\u2014whoever  it was who had failed  to fasten down the engine  hood. Nothing but what had  stopped us could stop a sandcat:  sand in the delicate  mechanism of the atomic engine.\n\n\n But no; she blamed it all on  me somehow: So we were out  walking on the spongy sand  of the Martian desert. We'd  been walking a good eight  hours.\n\n\n \"Can't we turn back now,  Ron?\" Val pleaded. \"Maybe  there isn't any uranium in  this sector at all. I think  we're crazy to keep on searching  out here!\"\n\n\n I started to tell her that the  UranCo chief had assured me  we'd hit something out this  way, but changed my mind.  When Val's tired and overwrought  there's no sense in  arguing with her.\n\n\n I stared ahead at the bleak,  desolate wastes of the Martian  landscape. Behind us  somewhere was the comfort  of the Dome, ahead nothing  but the mazes and gullies of  this dead world. He was a cripple in a wheelchair\u2014helpless as a rattlesnake. \"Try to keep going, Val.\"  My gloved hand reached out  and clumsily enfolded hers.  \"Come on, kid. Remember\u2014we're  doing this for Earth.  We're heroes.\"\n\n\n She glared at me. \"Heroes,  hell!\" she muttered. \"That's  the way it looked back home,  but, out there it doesn't seem  so glorious. And UranCo's  pay is stinking.\"\n\n\n \"We didn't come out here  for the pay, Val.\"\n\n\n \"I know, I know, but just  the same\u2014\"\n\n\n It must have been hell for  her. We had wandered fruitlessly  over the red sands all  day, both of us listening for  the clicks of the counter. And  the geigers had been obstinately  hushed all day, except  for their constant undercurrent  of meaningless noises.\n\n\n Even though the Martian  gravity was only a fraction of  Earth's, I was starting to  tire, and I knew it must have  been really rough on Val with  her lovely but unrugged legs.\n\n\n \"Heroes,\" she said bitterly.  \"We're not heroes\u2014we're  suckers! Why did I ever let  you volunteer for the Geig  Corps and drag me along?\"\n\n\n Which wasn't anywhere  close to the truth. Now I  knew she was at the breaking  point, because Val didn't lie  unless she was so exhausted  she didn't know what she was  doing. She had been just as  much inflamed by the idea of  coming to Mars to help in the  search for uranium as I was.  We knew the pay was poor,  but we had felt it a sort of  obligation, something we  could do as individuals to  keep the industries of radioactives-starved  Earth going.  And we'd always had a roving  foot, both of us.\n\n\n No, we had decided together  to come to Mars\u2014the  way we decided together on  everything. Now she was  turning against me. I tried to jolly her. \"Buck  up, kid,\" I said. I didn't dare  turn up her oxy pressure any  higher, but it was obvious she  couldn't keep going. She was  almost sleep-walking now.\n\n\n We pressed on over the  barren terrain. The geiger  kept up a fairly steady click-pattern,  but never broke into  that sudden explosive tumult  that meant we had found pay-dirt.  I started to feel tired  myself, terribly tired. I longed  to lie down on the soft,  spongy Martian sand and  bury myself.\n\n\n I looked at Val. She was  dragging along with her eyes  half-shut. I felt almost guilty  for having dragged her out to  Mars, until I recalled that I  hadn't. In fact, she had come  up with the idea before I did.  I wished there was some way  of turning the weary, bedraggled  girl at my side back into  the Val who had so enthusiastically  suggested we join  the Geigs.\n\n\n Twelve steps later, I decided  this was about as far as  we could go.\n\n\n I stopped, slipped out of  the geiger harness, and lowered  myself ponderously to  the ground. \"What'samatter,  Ron?\" Val asked sleepily.  \"Something wrong?\"\n\n\n \"No, baby,\" I said, putting  out a hand and taking hers.  \"I think we ought to rest a  little before we go any further.  It's been a long, hard  day.\"\n\n\n It didn't take much to persuade  her. She slid down beside  me, curled up, and in a  moment she was fast asleep,  sprawled out on the sands. Poor kid , I thought. Maybe  we shouldn't have come to  Mars after all. But, I reminded  myself, someone had to do  the job.\n\n\n A second thought appeared,  but I squelched it:\n\n\n Why the hell me?\n\n\n I looked down at Valerie's  sleeping form, and thought of  our warm, comfortable little  home on Earth. It wasn't  much, but people in love don't  need very fancy surroundings.\n\n\n I watched her, sleeping  peacefully, a wayward lock of  her soft blonde hair trailing  down over one eyebrow, and  it seemed hard to believe that  we'd exchanged Earth and all  it held for us for the raw, untamed  struggle that was Mars.  But I knew I'd do it again, if  I had the chance. It's because  we wanted to keep what we  had. Heroes? Hell, no. We  just liked our comforts, and  wanted to keep them. Which  took a little work. Time to get moving. But  then Val stirred and rolled  over in her sleep, and I didn't  have the heart to wake her. I  sat there, holding her, staring  out over the desert, watching  the wind whip the sand up  into weird shapes.\n\n\n The Geig Corps preferred  married couples, working in  teams. That's what had finally  decided it for us\u2014we were a  good team. We had no ties on  Earth that couldn't be broken  without much difficulty. So  we volunteered. And here we are. Heroes.  The wind blasted a mass of  sand into my face, and I felt  it tinkle against the oxymask.\n\n\n I glanced at the suit-chronometer.  Getting late. I decided  once again to wake Val.  But she was tired. And I was  tired too, tired from our  wearying journey across the  empty desert.\n\n\n I started to shake Val. But  I never finished. It would be so nice just to lean back and  nuzzle up to her, down in the  sand. So nice. I yawned, and  stretched back. I awoke with a sudden startled  shiver, and realized angrily  I had let myself doze off.  \"Come on, Val,\" I said savagely,  and started to rise to  my feet.\n\n\n I couldn't.\n\n\n I looked down. I was neatly  bound in thin, tough, plastic  tangle-cord, swathed from  chin to boot-bottoms, my  arms imprisoned, my feet  caught. And tangle-cord is  about as easy to get out of as  a spider's web is for a trapped  fly.\n\n\n It wasn't Martians that  had done it. There weren't  any Martians, hadn't been for  a million years. It was some  Earthman who had bound us.\n\n\n I rolled my eyes toward  Val, and saw that she was  similarly trussed in the sticky  stuff. The tangle-cord was still  fresh, giving off a faint, repugnant  odor like that of drying  fish. It had been spun on  us only a short time ago, I  realized.\n\n\n \"Ron\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't try to move, baby.  This stuff can break your  neck if you twist it wrong.\"  She continued for a moment  to struggle futilely, and I had  to snap, \"Lie still, Val!\"\n\n\n \"A very wise statement,\"  said a brittle, harsh voice  from above me. I looked up  and saw a helmeted figure  above us. He wasn't wearing  the customary skin-tight pliable  oxysuits we had. He  wore an outmoded, bulky  spacesuit and a fishbowl helmet,  all but the face area  opaque. The oxygen cannisters  weren't attached to his  back as expected, though.  They were strapped to the  back of the wheelchair in  which he sat.\n\n\n Through the fishbowl I  could see hard little eyes, a  yellowed, parchment-like face,  a grim-set jaw. I didn't recognize  him, and this struck me  odd. I thought I knew everyone  on sparsely-settled Mars.  Somehow I'd missed him.\n\n\n What shocked me most was  that he had no legs. The  spacesuit ended neatly at the  thighs.\n\n\n He was holding in his left  hand the tanglegun with  which he had entrapped us,  and a very efficient-looking  blaster was in his right.\n\n\n \"I didn't want to disturb  your sleep,\" he said coldly.  \"So I've been waiting here  for you to wake up.\"\n\n\n I could just see it. He might  have been sitting there for  hours, complacently waiting  to see how we'd wake up.  That was when I realized he  must be totally insane. I could  feel my stomach-muscles  tighten, my throat constrict  painfully.\n\n\n Then anger ripped through  me, washing away the terror.  \"What's going on?\" I demanded,  staring at the half  of a man who confronted us  from the wheelchair. \"Who  are you?\"\n\n\n \"You'll find out soon  enough,\" he said. \"Suppose  now you come with me.\" He  reached for the tanglegun,  flipped the little switch on its  side to MELT, and shot a  stream of watery fluid over  our legs, keeping the blaster  trained on us all the while.  Our legs were free.\n\n\n \"You may get up now,\" he  said. \"Slowly, without trying  to make trouble.\" Val and I  helped each other to our feet  as best we could, considering  our arms were still tightly  bound against the sides of our  oxysuits.\n\n\n \"Walk,\" the stranger said,  waving the tanglegun to indicate  the direction. \"I'll be  right behind you.\" He holstered  the tanglegun.\n\n\n I glimpsed the bulk of an  outboard atomic rigging behind  him, strapped to the  back of the wheelchair. He  fingered a knob on the arm of  the chair and the two exhaust  ducts behind the wheel-housings  flamed for a moment,  and the chair began to roll.\n\n\n Obediently, we started  walking. You don't argue  with a blaster, even if the  man pointing it is in a wheelchair. \"What's going on, Ron?\"  Val asked in a low voice as we  walked. Behind us the wheelchair  hissed steadily.\n\n\n \"I don't quite know, Val.  I've never seen this guy before,  and I thought I knew  everyone at the Dome.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet up there!\" our captor  called, and we stopped  talking. We trudged along together,  with him following  behind; I could hear the crunch-crunch of the wheelchair  as its wheels chewed  into the sand. I wondered  where we were going, and  why. I wondered why we had  ever left Earth.\n\n\n The answer to that came to  me quick enough: we had to.  Earth needed radioactives,  and the only way to get them  was to get out and look. The  great atomic wars of the late  20th Century had used up  much of the supply, but the  amount used to blow up half  the great cities of the world  hardly compared with the  amount we needed to put  them back together again.\n\n\n In three centuries the shattered  world had been completely  rebuilt. The wreckage  of New York and Shanghai  and London and all the other  ruined cities had been hidden  by a shining new world of  gleaming towers and flying  roadways. We had profited by  our grandparents' mistakes.  They had used their atomics  to make bombs. We used ours  for fuel.\n\n\n It was an atomic world.  Everything: power drills,  printing presses, typewriters,  can openers, ocean liners,  powered by the inexhaustible  energy of the dividing atom.\n\n\n But though the energy is  inexhaustible, the supply of  nuclei isn't. After three centuries  of heavy consumption,  the supply failed. The mighty  machine that was Earth's industry  had started to slow  down.\n\n\n And that started the chain  of events that led Val and me  to end up as a madman's prisoners,  on Mars. With every  source of uranium mined dry  on Earth, we had tried other  possibilities. All sorts of  schemes came forth. Project  Sea-Dredge was trying to get  uranium from the oceans. In  forty or fifty years, they'd  get some results, we hoped.  But there wasn't forty or  fifty years' worth of raw stuff  to tide us over until then. In a  decade or so, our power would  be just about gone. I could  picture the sort of dog-eat-dog  world we'd revert back  to. Millions of starving, freezing  humans tooth-and-clawing  in it in the useless shell of  a great atomic civilization.\n\n\n So, Mars. There's not much  uranium on Mars, and it's not  easy to find or any cinch to  mine. But what little is there,  helps. It's a stopgap effort,  just to keep things moving  until Project Sea-Dredge  starts functioning.\n\n\n Enter the Geig Corps: volunteers  out on the face of  Mars, combing for its uranium  deposits.\n\n\n And here we are, I thought. After we walked on a  while, a Dome became visible  up ahead. It slid up over the  crest of a hill, set back between  two hummocks on the  desert. Just out of the way  enough to escape observation.\n\n\n For a puzzled moment I  thought it was our Dome, the  settlement where all of UranCo's  Geig Corps were located,  but another look told me that  this was actually quite near  us and fairly small. A one-man  Dome, of all things!\n\n\n \"Welcome to my home,\" he  said. \"The name is Gregory  Ledman.\" He herded us off to  one side of the airlock, uttered  a few words keyed to his  voice, and motioned us inside  when the door slid up. When  we were inside he reached up,  clumsily holding the blaster,  and unscrewed the ancient  spacesuit fishbowl.\n\n\n His face was a bitter,  dried-up mask. He was a man  who hated.\n\n\n The place was spartanly  furnished. No chairs, no tape-player,  no decoration of any  sort. Hard bulkhead walls,  rivet-studded, glared back  at us. He had an automatic  chef, a bed, and a writing-desk,  and no other furniture.\n\n\n Suddenly he drew the tanglegun  and sprayed our legs  again. We toppled heavily to  the floor. I looked up angrily. \"I imagine you want to  know the whole story,\" he  said. \"The others did, too.\"\n\n\n Valerie looked at me anxiously.  Her pretty face was a  dead white behind her oxymask.  \"What others?\"\n\n\n \"I never bothered to find  out their names,\" Ledman  said casually. \"They were  other Geigs I caught unawares,  like you, out on the  desert. That's the only sport I  have left\u2014Geig-hunting. Look  out there.\"\n\n\n He gestured through the  translucent skin of the Dome,  and I felt sick. There was a  little heap of bones lying  there, looking oddly bright  against the redness of the  sands. They were the dried,  parched skeletons of Earthmen.  Bits of cloth and plastic,  once oxymasks and suits, still  clung to them.\n\n\n Suddenly I remembered.  There had been a pattern  there all the time. We didn't  much talk about it; we chalked  it off as occupational hazards.  There had been a pattern  of disappearances on the desert.  I could think of six, eight  names now. None of them  had been particularly close  friends. You don't get time to  make close friends out here.  But we'd vowed it wouldn't  happen to us.\n\n\n It had.\n\n\n \"You've been hunting  Geigs?\" I asked. \" Why? What've they ever done to  you?\"\n\n\n He smiled, as calmly as if  I'd just praised his house-keeping.  \"Because I hate  you,\" he said blandly. \"I intend  to wipe every last one of  you out, one by one.\"\n\n\n I stared at him. I'd never  seen a man like this before; I  thought all his kind had died  at the time of the atomic  wars.\n\n\n I heard Val sob, \"He's a  madman!\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Ledman said evenly.  \"I'm quite sane, believe me.  But I'm determined to drive  the Geigs\u2014and UranCo\u2014off  Mars. Eventually I'll scare  you all away.\"\n\n\n \"Just pick us off in the desert?\"\n\n\n \"Exactly,\" replied Ledman.  \"And I have no fears of an  armed attack. This place is  well fortified. I've devoted  years to building it. And I'm  back against those hills. They  couldn't pry me out.\" He let  his pale hand run up into his  gnarled hair. \"I've devoted  years to this. Ever since\u2014ever  since I landed here on  Mars.\" \"What are you going to do  with us?\" Val finally asked,  after a long silence.\n\n\n He didn't smile this time.  \"Kill you,\" he told her. \"Not  your husband. I want him as  an envoy, to go back and tell  the others to clear off.\" He  rocked back and forth in his  wheelchair, toying with the  gleaming, deadly blaster in  his hand.\n\n\n We stared in horror. It was  a nightmare\u2014sitting there,  placidly rocking back and  forth, a nightmare.\n\n\n I found myself fervently  wishing I was back out there  on the infinitely safer desert.\n\n\n \"Do I shock you?\" he asked.  \"I shouldn't\u2014not when  you see my motives.\"\n\n\n \"We don't see them,\" I  snapped.\n\n\n \"Well, let me show you.  You're on Mars hunting uranium,  right? To mine and  ship the radioactives back to  Earth to keep the atomic engines  going. Right?\"\n\n\n I nodded over at our geiger  counters.\n\n\n \"We volunteered to come to  Mars,\" Val said irrelevantly.\n\n\n \"Ah\u2014two young heroes,\"  Ledman said acidly. \"How  sad. I could almost feel sorry  for you. Almost.\"\n\n\n \"Just what is it you're  after?\" I said, stalling, stalling.\n\n\n \"Atomics cost me my legs,\"  he said. \"You remember the  Sadlerville Blast?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Of course.\" And I did, too.  I'd never forget it. No one  would. How could I forget  that great accident\u2014killing  hundreds, injuring thousands  more, sterilizing forty miles  of Mississippi land\u2014when  the Sadlerville pile went up?\n\n\n \"I was there on business at  the time,\" Ledman said. \"I  represented Ledman Atomics.  I was there to sign a new  contract for my company.  You know who I am, now?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"I was fairly well shielded  when it happened. I never got  the contract, but I got a good  dose of radiation instead. Not  enough to kill me,\" he said.  \"Just enough to necessitate  the removal of\u2014\" he indicated  the empty space at his  thighs. \"So I got off lightly.\"  He gestured at the wheelchair  blanket.\n\n\n I still didn't understand.  \"But why kill us Geigs? We had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\n \"You're just in this by accident,\"  he said. \"You see, after  the explosion and the amputation,  my fellow-members on  the board of Ledman Atomics  decided that a semi-basket  case like myself was a poor  risk as Head of the Board,  and they took my company  away. All quite legal, I assure  you. They left me almost a  pauper!\" Then he snapped  the punchline at me.\n\n\n \"They renamed Ledman  Atomics. Who did you say you  worked for?\"\n\n\n I began, \"Uran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't bother. A more inventive  title than Ledman  Atomics, but not quite as  much heart, wouldn't you  say?\" He grinned. \"I saved  for years; then I came to  Mars, lost myself, built this  Dome, and swore to get even.  There's not a great deal of  uranium on this planet, but  enough to keep me in a style  to which, unfortunately, I'm  no longer accustomed.\" He consulted his wrist  watch. \"Time for my injection.\"  He pulled out the tanglegun  and sprayed us again,  just to make doubly certain.  \"That's another little souvenir  of Sadlerville. I'm short  on red blood corpuscles.\"\n\n\n He rolled over to a wall  table and fumbled in a container  among a pile of hypodermics.  \"There are other injections,  too. Adrenalin, insulin.  Others. The Blast turned  me into a walking pin-cushion.  But I'll pay it all  back,\" he said. He plunged  the needle into his arm.\n\n\n My eyes widened. It was  too nightmarish to be real. I  wasn't seriously worried  about his threat to wipe out  the entire Geig Corps, since  it was unlikely that one man  in a wheelchair could pick us  all off. No, it wasn't the  threat that disturbed me, so  much as the whole concept, so  strange to me, that the human  mind could be as warped  and twisted as Ledman's.\n\n\n I saw the horror on Val's  face, and I knew she felt the  same way I did.\n\n\n \"Do you really think you  can succeed?\" I taunted him.  \"Really think you can kill  every Earthman on Mars? Of  all the insane, cockeyed\u2014\"\n\n\n Val's quick, worried head-shake  cut me off. But Ledman  had felt my words, all right.\n\n\n \"Yes! I'll get even with  every one of you for taking  away my legs! If we hadn't  meddled with the atom in the  first place, I'd be as tall and  powerful as you, today\u2014instead  of a useless cripple in a  wheelchair.\"\n\n\n \"You're sick, Gregory Ledman,\"  Val said quietly.  \"You've conceived an impossible  scheme of revenge and  now you're taking it out on  innocent people who've done  nothing, nothing at all to you.  That's not sane!\"\n\n\n His eyes blazed. \"Who are  you to talk of sanity?\" Uneasily I caught Val's  glance from a corner of my  eye. Sweat was rolling down  her smooth forehead faster  than the auto-wiper could  swab it away.\n\n\n \"Why don't you do something?  What are you waiting  for, Ron?\"\n\n\n \"Easy, baby,\" I said. I  knew what our ace in the hole  was. But I had to get Ledman  within reach of me first.\n\n\n \"Enough,\" he said. \"I'm going  to turn you loose outside,  right after\u2014\"\n\n\n \" Get sick! \" I hissed to Val,  low. She began immediately  to cough violently, emitting  harsh, choking sobs. \"Can't  breathe!\" She began to yell,  writhing in her bonds.\n\n\n That did it. Ledman hadn't  much humanity left in him,  but there was a little. He lowered  the blaster a bit and  wheeled one-hand over to see  what was wrong with Val.  She continued to retch and  moan most horribly. It almost  convinced me. I saw Val's  pale, frightened face turn to  me.\n\n\n He approached and peered  down at her. He opened his  mouth to say something, and  at that moment I snapped my  leg up hard, tearing the tangle-cord  with a snicking rasp,  and kicked his wheelchair  over.\n\n\n The blaster went off, burning  a hole through the Dome  roof. The automatic sealers  glued-in instantly. Ledman  went sprawling helplessly out  into the middle of the floor,  the wheelchair upended next  to him, its wheels slowly revolving  in the air. The blaster  flew from his hands at the  impact of landing and spun  out near me. In one quick motion  I rolled over and covered  it with my body. Ledman clawed his way to  me with tremendous effort  and tried wildly to pry the  blaster out from under me,  but without success. I twisted  a bit, reached out with my  free leg, and booted him  across the floor. He fetched  up against the wall of the  Dome and lay there.\n\n\n Val rolled over to me.\n\n\n \"Now if I could get free of  this stuff,\" I said, \"I could get  him covered before he comes  to. But how?\"\n\n\n \"Teamwork,\" Val said. She  swivelled around on the floor  until her head was near my  boot. \"Push my oxymask off  with your foot, if you can.\"\n\n\n I searched for the clamp  and tried to flip it. No luck,  with my heavy, clumsy boot.  I tried again, and this time it  snapped open. I got the tip  of my boot in and pried upward.  The oxymask came off,  slowly, scraping a jagged red  scratch up the side of Val's  neck as it came.\n\n\n \"There,\" she breathed.  \"That's that.\"\n\n\n I looked uneasily at Ledman.  He was groaning and  beginning to stir.\n\n\n Val rolled on the floor and  her face lay near my right  arm. I saw what she had in  mind. She began to nibble the  vile-tasting tangle-cord, running  her teeth up and down  it until it started to give. She  continued unfailingly.\n\n\n Finally one strand snapped.  Then another. At last I  had enough use of my hand  to reach out and grasp the  blaster. Then I pulled myself  across the floor to Ledman,  removed the tanglegun, and  melted the remaining tangle-cord  off.\n\n\n My muscles were stiff and  bunched, and rising made me  wince. I turned and freed Val.  Then I turned and faced Ledman.\n\n\n \"I suppose you'll kill me  now,\" he said.\n\n\n \"No. That's the difference  between sane people and insane,\"  I told him. \"I'm not  going to kill you at all. I'm  going to see to it that you're  sent back to Earth.\"\n\n\n \" No! \" he shouted. \"No!  Anything but back there. I  don't want to face them again\u2014not  after what they did to  me\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not so loud,\" I broke in.  \"They'll help you on Earth.  They'll take all the hatred and  sickness out of you, and turn  you into a useful member of  society again.\"\n\n\n \"I hate Earthmen,\" he spat  out. \"I hate all of them.\"\n\n\n \"I know,\" I said sarcastically.  \"You're just all full of  hate. You hated us so much  that you couldn't bear to hang  around on Earth for as much  as a year after the Sadlerville  Blast. You had to take right  off for Mars without a moment's  delay, didn't you? You  hated Earth so much you had to leave.\"\n\n\n \"Why are you telling all  this to me?\"\n\n\n \"Because if you'd stayed  long enough, you'd have used  some of your pension money  to buy yourself a pair of prosthetic  legs, and then you  wouldn't need this wheelchair.\"\n\n\n Ledman scowled, and then  his face went belligerent  again. \"They told me I was  paralyzed below the waist.  That I'd never walk again,  even with prosthetic legs, because  I had no muscles to fit  them to.\"\n\n\n \"You left Earth too quickly,\"  Val said.\n\n\n \"It was the only way,\" he  protested. \"I had to get off\u2014\"\n\n\n \"She's right,\" I told him.  \"The atom can take away, but  it can give as well. Soon after  you left they developed atomic-powered prosthetics\u2014amazing  things, virtually robot  legs. All the survivors of  the Sadlerville Blast were  given the necessary replacement  limbs free of charge. All  except you. You were so sick  you had to get away from the  world you despised and come  here.\"\n\n\n \"You're lying,\" he said.  \"It's not true!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, but it is,\" Val smiled.\n\n\n I saw him wilt visibly, and  for a moment I almost felt  sorry for him, a pathetic legless  figure propped up against  the wall of the Dome at  blaster-point. But then I remembered  he'd killed twelve  Geigs\u2014or more\u2014and would  have added Val to the number  had he had the chance. \"You're a very sick man,  Ledman,\" I said. \"All this  time you could have been  happy, useful on Earth, instead  of being holed up here  nursing your hatred. You  might have been useful, on  Earth. But you decided to  channel everything out as revenge.\"\n\n\n \"I still don't believe it\u2014those  legs. I might have walked  again. No\u2014no, it's all a lie.  They told me I'd never walk,\"  he said, weakly but stubbornly  still.\n\n\n I could see his whole structure  of hate starting to topple,  and I decided to give it  the final push.\n\n\n \"Haven't you wondered  how I managed to break the  tangle-cord when I kicked you  over?\"\n\n\n \"Yes\u2014human legs aren't  strong enough to break tangle-cord  that way.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I said. I  gave Val the blaster and slipped  out of my oxysuit.  \"Look,\" I said. I pointed to  my smooth, gleaming metal  legs. The almost soundless  purr of their motors was the  only noise in the room. \"I was  in the Sadlerville Blast, too,\"  I said. \"But I didn't go crazy  with hate when I lost my legs.\"\n\n\n Ledman was sobbing.\n\n\n \"Okay, Ledman,\" I said.  Val got him into his suit, and  brought him the fishbowl helmet.  \"Get your helmet on and  let's go. Between the psychs  and the prosthetics men,  you'll be a new man inside of  a year.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm a murderer!\"\n\n\n \"That's right. And you'll be  sentenced to psych adjustment.  When they're finished,  Gregory Ledman the killer  will be as dead as if they'd  electrocuted you, but there'll  be a new\u2014and sane\u2014Gregory  Ledman.\" I turned to Val.\n\n\n \"Got the geigers, honey?\"\n\n\n For the first time since  Ledman had caught us, I remembered  how tired Val had  been out on the desert. I realized  now that I had been driving  her mercilessly\u2014me, with  my chromium legs and atomic-powered  muscles. No wonder  she was ready to fold!  And I'd been too dense to see  how unfair I had been.\n\n\n She lifted the geiger harnesses,  and I put Ledman  back in his wheelchair.\n\n\n Val slipped her oxymask  back on and fastened it shut.\n\n\n \"Let's get back to the Dome  in a hurry,\" I said. \"We'll  turn Ledman over to the authorities.  Then we can catch  the next ship for Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Go back? Go back? If you  think I'm backing down now  and quitting you can find  yourself another wife! After  we dump this guy I'm sacking  in for twenty hours, and then  we're going back out there to  finish that search-pattern.  Earth needs uranium, honey,  and I know you'd never be  happy quitting in the middle  like that.\" She smiled. \"I  can't wait to get out there  and start listening for those  tell-tale clicks.\"\n\n\n I gave a joyful whoop and  swung her around. When I  put her down, she squeezed  my hand, hard.\n\n\n \"Let's get moving, fellow  hero,\" she said.\n\n\n I pressed the stud for the  airlock, smiling.

But they had to run head-on against a mad  genius who had a motto: Death to all Terrans! \"Let's  keep moving,\" I told  Val. \"The surest way to  die out here on Mars is to  give up.\" I reached over and  turned up the pressure on her  oxymask to make things a  little easier for her. Through  the glassite of the mask, I  could see her face contorted  in an agony of fatigue.\n\n\n And she probably thought  the failure of the sandcat was  all my fault, too. Val's usually  about the best wife a guy  could ask for, but when she  wants to be she can be a real  flying bother.\n\n\n It was beyond her to see  that some grease monkey back  at the Dome was at fault\u2014whoever  it was who had failed  to fasten down the engine  hood. Nothing but what had  stopped us could stop a sandcat:  sand in the delicate  mechanism of the atomic engine.\n\n\n But no; she blamed it all on  me somehow: So we were out  walking on the spongy sand  of the Martian desert. We'd  been walking a good eight  hours.\n\n\n \"Can't we turn back now,  Ron?\" Val pleaded. \"Maybe  there isn't any uranium in  this sector at all. I think  we're crazy to keep on searching  out here!\"\n\n\n I started to tell her that the  UranCo chief had assured me  we'd hit something out this  way, but changed my mind.  When Val's tired and overwrought  there's no sense in  arguing with her.\n\n\n I stared ahead at the bleak,  desolate wastes of the Martian  landscape. Behind us  somewhere was the comfort  of the Dome, ahead nothing  but the mazes and gullies of  this dead world. He was a cripple in a wheelchair\u2014helpless as a rattlesnake. \"Try to keep going, Val.\"  My gloved hand reached out  and clumsily enfolded hers.  \"Come on, kid. Remember\u2014we're  doing this for Earth.  We're heroes.\"\n\n\n She glared at me. \"Heroes,  hell!\" she muttered. \"That's  the way it looked back home,  but, out there it doesn't seem  so glorious. And UranCo's  pay is stinking.\"\n\n\n \"We didn't come out here  for the pay, Val.\"\n\n\n \"I know, I know, but just  the same\u2014\"\n\n\n It must have been hell for  her. We had wandered fruitlessly  over the red sands all  day, both of us listening for  the clicks of the counter. And  the geigers had been obstinately  hushed all day, except  for their constant undercurrent  of meaningless noises.\n\n\n Even though the Martian  gravity was only a fraction of  Earth's, I was starting to  tire, and I knew it must have  been really rough on Val with  her lovely but unrugged legs.\n\n\n \"Heroes,\" she said bitterly.  \"We're not heroes\u2014we're  suckers! Why did I ever let  you volunteer for the Geig  Corps and drag me along?\"\n\n\n Which wasn't anywhere  close to the truth. Now I  knew she was at the breaking  point, because Val didn't lie  unless she was so exhausted  she didn't know what she was  doing. She had been just as  much inflamed by the idea of  coming to Mars to help in the  search for uranium as I was.  We knew the pay was poor,  but we had felt it a sort of  obligation, something we  could do as individuals to  keep the industries of radioactives-starved  Earth going.  And we'd always had a roving  foot, both of us.\n\n\n No, we had decided together  to come to Mars\u2014the  way we decided together on  everything. Now she was  turning against me. I tried to jolly her. \"Buck  up, kid,\" I said. I didn't dare  turn up her oxy pressure any  higher, but it was obvious she  couldn't keep going. She was  almost sleep-walking now.\n\n\n We pressed on over the  barren terrain. The geiger  kept up a fairly steady click-pattern,  but never broke into  that sudden explosive tumult  that meant we had found pay-dirt.  I started to feel tired  myself, terribly tired. I longed  to lie down on the soft,  spongy Martian sand and  bury myself.\n\n\n I looked at Val. She was  dragging along with her eyes  half-shut. I felt almost guilty  for having dragged her out to  Mars, until I recalled that I  hadn't. In fact, she had come  up with the idea before I did.  I wished there was some way  of turning the weary, bedraggled  girl at my side back into  the Val who had so enthusiastically  suggested we join  the Geigs.\n\n\n Twelve steps later, I decided  this was about as far as  we could go.\n\n\n I stopped, slipped out of  the geiger harness, and lowered  myself ponderously to  the ground. \"What'samatter,  Ron?\" Val asked sleepily.  \"Something wrong?\"\n\n\n \"No, baby,\" I said, putting  out a hand and taking hers.  \"I think we ought to rest a  little before we go any further.  It's been a long, hard  day.\"\n\n\n It didn't take much to persuade  her. She slid down beside  me, curled up, and in a  moment she was fast asleep,  sprawled out on the sands. Poor kid , I thought. Maybe  we shouldn't have come to  Mars after all. But, I reminded  myself, someone had to do  the job.\n\n\n A second thought appeared,  but I squelched it:\n\n\n Why the hell me?\n\n\n I looked down at Valerie's  sleeping form, and thought of  our warm, comfortable little  home on Earth. It wasn't  much, but people in love don't  need very fancy surroundings.\n\n\n I watched her, sleeping  peacefully, a wayward lock of  her soft blonde hair trailing  down over one eyebrow, and  it seemed hard to believe that  we'd exchanged Earth and all  it held for us for the raw, untamed  struggle that was Mars.  But I knew I'd do it again, if  I had the chance. It's because  we wanted to keep what we  had. Heroes? Hell, no. We  just liked our comforts, and  wanted to keep them. Which  took a little work. Time to get moving. But  then Val stirred and rolled  over in her sleep, and I didn't  have the heart to wake her. I  sat there, holding her, staring  out over the desert, watching  the wind whip the sand up  into weird shapes.\n\n\n The Geig Corps preferred  married couples, working in  teams. That's what had finally  decided it for us\u2014we were a  good team. We had no ties on  Earth that couldn't be broken  without much difficulty. So  we volunteered. And here we are. Heroes.  The wind blasted a mass of  sand into my face, and I felt  it tinkle against the oxymask.\n\n\n I glanced at the suit-chronometer.  Getting late. I decided  once again to wake Val.  But she was tired. And I was  tired too, tired from our  wearying journey across the  empty desert.\n\n\n I started to shake Val. But  I never finished. It would be so nice just to lean back and  nuzzle up to her, down in the  sand. So nice. I yawned, and  stretched back. I awoke with a sudden startled  shiver, and realized angrily  I had let myself doze off.  \"Come on, Val,\" I said savagely,  and started to rise to  my feet.\n\n\n I couldn't.\n\n\n I looked down. I was neatly  bound in thin, tough, plastic  tangle-cord, swathed from  chin to boot-bottoms, my  arms imprisoned, my feet  caught. And tangle-cord is  about as easy to get out of as  a spider's web is for a trapped  fly.\n\n\n It wasn't Martians that  had done it. There weren't  any Martians, hadn't been for  a million years. It was some  Earthman who had bound us.\n\n\n I rolled my eyes toward  Val, and saw that she was  similarly trussed in the sticky  stuff. The tangle-cord was still  fresh, giving off a faint, repugnant  odor like that of drying  fish. It had been spun on  us only a short time ago, I  realized.\n\n\n \"Ron\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't try to move, baby.  This stuff can break your  neck if you twist it wrong.\"  She continued for a moment  to struggle futilely, and I had  to snap, \"Lie still, Val!\"\n\n\n \"A very wise statement,\"  said a brittle, harsh voice  from above me. I looked up  and saw a helmeted figure  above us. He wasn't wearing  the customary skin-tight pliable  oxysuits we had. He  wore an outmoded, bulky  spacesuit and a fishbowl helmet,  all but the face area  opaque. The oxygen cannisters  weren't attached to his  back as expected, though.  They were strapped to the  back of the wheelchair in  which he sat.\n\n\n Through the fishbowl I  could see hard little eyes, a  yellowed, parchment-like face,  a grim-set jaw. I didn't recognize  him, and this struck me  odd. I thought I knew everyone  on sparsely-settled Mars.  Somehow I'd missed him.\n\n\n What shocked me most was  that he had no legs. The  spacesuit ended neatly at the  thighs.\n\n\n He was holding in his left  hand the tanglegun with  which he had entrapped us,  and a very efficient-looking  blaster was in his right.\n\n\n \"I didn't want to disturb  your sleep,\" he said coldly.  \"So I've been waiting here  for you to wake up.\"\n\n\n I could just see it. He might  have been sitting there for  hours, complacently waiting  to see how we'd wake up.  That was when I realized he  must be totally insane. I could  feel my stomach-muscles  tighten, my throat constrict  painfully.\n\n\n Then anger ripped through  me, washing away the terror.  \"What's going on?\" I demanded,  staring at the half  of a man who confronted us  from the wheelchair. \"Who  are you?\"\n\n\n \"You'll find out soon  enough,\" he said. \"Suppose  now you come with me.\" He  reached for the tanglegun,  flipped the little switch on its  side to MELT, and shot a  stream of watery fluid over  our legs, keeping the blaster  trained on us all the while.  Our legs were free.\n\n\n \"You may get up now,\" he  said. \"Slowly, without trying  to make trouble.\" Val and I  helped each other to our feet  as best we could, considering  our arms were still tightly  bound against the sides of our  oxysuits.\n\n\n \"Walk,\" the stranger said,  waving the tanglegun to indicate  the direction. \"I'll be  right behind you.\" He holstered  the tanglegun.\n\n\n I glimpsed the bulk of an  outboard atomic rigging behind  him, strapped to the  back of the wheelchair. He  fingered a knob on the arm of  the chair and the two exhaust  ducts behind the wheel-housings  flamed for a moment,  and the chair began to roll.\n\n\n Obediently, we started  walking. You don't argue  with a blaster, even if the  man pointing it is in a wheelchair. \"What's going on, Ron?\"  Val asked in a low voice as we  walked. Behind us the wheelchair  hissed steadily.\n\n\n \"I don't quite know, Val.  I've never seen this guy before,  and I thought I knew  everyone at the Dome.\"\n\n\n \"Quiet up there!\" our captor  called, and we stopped  talking. We trudged along together,  with him following  behind; I could hear the crunch-crunch of the wheelchair  as its wheels chewed  into the sand. I wondered  where we were going, and  why. I wondered why we had  ever left Earth.\n\n\n The answer to that came to  me quick enough: we had to.  Earth needed radioactives,  and the only way to get them  was to get out and look. The  great atomic wars of the late  20th Century had used up  much of the supply, but the  amount used to blow up half  the great cities of the world  hardly compared with the  amount we needed to put  them back together again.\n\n\n In three centuries the shattered  world had been completely  rebuilt. The wreckage  of New York and Shanghai  and London and all the other  ruined cities had been hidden  by a shining new world of  gleaming towers and flying  roadways. We had profited by  our grandparents' mistakes.  They had used their atomics  to make bombs. We used ours  for fuel.\n\n\n It was an atomic world.  Everything: power drills,  printing presses, typewriters,  can openers, ocean liners,  powered by the inexhaustible  energy of the dividing atom.\n\n\n But though the energy is  inexhaustible, the supply of  nuclei isn't. After three centuries  of heavy consumption,  the supply failed. The mighty  machine that was Earth's industry  had started to slow  down.\n\n\n And that started the chain  of events that led Val and me  to end up as a madman's prisoners,  on Mars. With every  source of uranium mined dry  on Earth, we had tried other  possibilities. All sorts of  schemes came forth. Project  Sea-Dredge was trying to get  uranium from the oceans. In  forty or fifty years, they'd  get some results, we hoped.  But there wasn't forty or  fifty years' worth of raw stuff  to tide us over until then. In a  decade or so, our power would  be just about gone. I could  picture the sort of dog-eat-dog  world we'd revert back  to. Millions of starving, freezing  humans tooth-and-clawing  in it in the useless shell of  a great atomic civilization.\n\n\n So, Mars. There's not much  uranium on Mars, and it's not  easy to find or any cinch to  mine. But what little is there,  helps. It's a stopgap effort,  just to keep things moving  until Project Sea-Dredge  starts functioning.\n\n\n Enter the Geig Corps: volunteers  out on the face of  Mars, combing for its uranium  deposits.\n\n\n And here we are, I thought. After we walked on a  while, a Dome became visible  up ahead. It slid up over the  crest of a hill, set back between  two hummocks on the  desert. Just out of the way  enough to escape observation.\n\n\n For a puzzled moment I  thought it was our Dome, the  settlement where all of UranCo's  Geig Corps were located,  but another look told me that  this was actually quite near  us and fairly small. A one-man  Dome, of all things!\n\n\n \"Welcome to my home,\" he  said. \"The name is Gregory  Ledman.\" He herded us off to  one side of the airlock, uttered  a few words keyed to his  voice, and motioned us inside  when the door slid up. When  we were inside he reached up,  clumsily holding the blaster,  and unscrewed the ancient  spacesuit fishbowl.\n\n\n His face was a bitter,  dried-up mask. He was a man  who hated.\n\n\n The place was spartanly  furnished. No chairs, no tape-player,  no decoration of any  sort. Hard bulkhead walls,  rivet-studded, glared back  at us. He had an automatic  chef, a bed, and a writing-desk,  and no other furniture.\n\n\n Suddenly he drew the tanglegun  and sprayed our legs  again. We toppled heavily to  the floor. I looked up angrily. \"I imagine you want to  know the whole story,\" he  said. \"The others did, too.\"\n\n\n Valerie looked at me anxiously.  Her pretty face was a  dead white behind her oxymask.  \"What others?\"\n\n\n \"I never bothered to find  out their names,\" Ledman  said casually. \"They were  other Geigs I caught unawares,  like you, out on the  desert. That's the only sport I  have left\u2014Geig-hunting. Look  out there.\"\n\n\n He gestured through the  translucent skin of the Dome,  and I felt sick. There was a  little heap of bones lying  there, looking oddly bright  against the redness of the  sands. They were the dried,  parched skeletons of Earthmen.  Bits of cloth and plastic,  once oxymasks and suits, still  clung to them.\n\n\n Suddenly I remembered.  There had been a pattern  there all the time. We didn't  much talk about it; we chalked  it off as occupational hazards.  There had been a pattern  of disappearances on the desert.  I could think of six, eight  names now. None of them  had been particularly close  friends. You don't get time to  make close friends out here.  But we'd vowed it wouldn't  happen to us.\n\n\n It had.\n\n\n \"You've been hunting  Geigs?\" I asked. \" Why? What've they ever done to  you?\"\n\n\n He smiled, as calmly as if  I'd just praised his house-keeping.  \"Because I hate  you,\" he said blandly. \"I intend  to wipe every last one of  you out, one by one.\"\n\n\n I stared at him. I'd never  seen a man like this before; I  thought all his kind had died  at the time of the atomic  wars.\n\n\n I heard Val sob, \"He's a  madman!\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Ledman said evenly.  \"I'm quite sane, believe me.  But I'm determined to drive  the Geigs\u2014and UranCo\u2014off  Mars. Eventually I'll scare  you all away.\"\n\n\n \"Just pick us off in the desert?\"\n\n\n \"Exactly,\" replied Ledman.  \"And I have no fears of an  armed attack. This place is  well fortified. I've devoted  years to building it. And I'm  back against those hills. They  couldn't pry me out.\" He let  his pale hand run up into his  gnarled hair. \"I've devoted  years to this. Ever since\u2014ever  since I landed here on  Mars.\" \"What are you going to do  with us?\" Val finally asked,  after a long silence.\n\n\n He didn't smile this time.  \"Kill you,\" he told her. \"Not  your husband. I want him as  an envoy, to go back and tell  the others to clear off.\" He  rocked back and forth in his  wheelchair, toying with the  gleaming, deadly blaster in  his hand.\n\n\n We stared in horror. It was  a nightmare\u2014sitting there,  placidly rocking back and  forth, a nightmare.\n\n\n I found myself fervently  wishing I was back out there  on the infinitely safer desert.\n\n\n \"Do I shock you?\" he asked.  \"I shouldn't\u2014not when  you see my motives.\"\n\n\n \"We don't see them,\" I  snapped.\n\n\n \"Well, let me show you.  You're on Mars hunting uranium,  right? To mine and  ship the radioactives back to  Earth to keep the atomic engines  going. Right?\"\n\n\n I nodded over at our geiger  counters.\n\n\n \"We volunteered to come to  Mars,\" Val said irrelevantly.\n\n\n \"Ah\u2014two young heroes,\"  Ledman said acidly. \"How  sad. I could almost feel sorry  for you. Almost.\"\n\n\n \"Just what is it you're  after?\" I said, stalling, stalling.\n\n\n \"Atomics cost me my legs,\"  he said. \"You remember the  Sadlerville Blast?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Of course.\" And I did, too.  I'd never forget it. No one  would. How could I forget  that great accident\u2014killing  hundreds, injuring thousands  more, sterilizing forty miles  of Mississippi land\u2014when  the Sadlerville pile went up?\n\n\n \"I was there on business at  the time,\" Ledman said. \"I  represented Ledman Atomics.  I was there to sign a new  contract for my company.  You know who I am, now?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"I was fairly well shielded  when it happened. I never got  the contract, but I got a good  dose of radiation instead. Not  enough to kill me,\" he said.  \"Just enough to necessitate  the removal of\u2014\" he indicated  the empty space at his  thighs. \"So I got off lightly.\"  He gestured at the wheelchair  blanket.\n\n\n I still didn't understand.  \"But why kill us Geigs? We had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\n \"You're just in this by accident,\"  he said. \"You see, after  the explosion and the amputation,  my fellow-members on  the board of Ledman Atomics  decided that a semi-basket  case like myself was a poor  risk as Head of the Board,  and they took my company  away. All quite legal, I assure  you. They left me almost a  pauper!\" Then he snapped  the punchline at me.\n\n\n \"They renamed Ledman  Atomics. Who did you say you  worked for?\"\n\n\n I began, \"Uran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't bother. A more inventive  title than Ledman  Atomics, but not quite as  much heart, wouldn't you  say?\" He grinned. \"I saved  for years; then I came to  Mars, lost myself, built this  Dome, and swore to get even.  There's not a great deal of  uranium on this planet, but  enough to keep me in a style  to which, unfortunately, I'm  no longer accustomed.\" He consulted his wrist  watch. \"Time for my injection.\"  He pulled out the tanglegun  and sprayed us again,  just to make doubly certain.  \"That's another little souvenir  of Sadlerville. I'm short  on red blood corpuscles.\"\n\n\n He rolled over to a wall  table and fumbled in a container  among a pile of hypodermics.  \"There are other injections,  too. Adrenalin, insulin.  Others. The Blast turned  me into a walking pin-cushion.  But I'll pay it all  back,\" he said. He plunged  the needle into his arm.\n\n\n My eyes widened. It was  too nightmarish to be real. I  wasn't seriously worried  about his threat to wipe out  the entire Geig Corps, since  it was unlikely that one man  in a wheelchair could pick us  all off. No, it wasn't the  threat that disturbed me, so  much as the whole concept, so  strange to me, that the human  mind could be as warped  and twisted as Ledman's.\n\n\n I saw the horror on Val's  face, and I knew she felt the  same way I did.\n\n\n \"Do you really think you  can succeed?\" I taunted him.  \"Really think you can kill  every Earthman on Mars? Of  all the insane, cockeyed\u2014\"\n\n\n Val's quick, worried head-shake  cut me off. But Ledman  had felt my words, all right.\n\n\n \"Yes! I'll get even with  every one of you for taking  away my legs! If we hadn't  meddled with the atom in the  first place, I'd be as tall and  powerful as you, today\u2014instead  of a useless cripple in a  wheelchair.\"\n\n\n \"You're sick, Gregory Ledman,\"  Val said quietly.  \"You've conceived an impossible  scheme of revenge and  now you're taking it out on  innocent people who've done  nothing, nothing at all to you.  That's not sane!\"\n\n\n His eyes blazed. \"Who are  you to talk of sanity?\" Uneasily I caught Val's  glance from a corner of my  eye. Sweat was rolling down  her smooth forehead faster  than the auto-wiper could  swab it away.\n\n\n \"Why don't you do something?  What are you waiting  for, Ron?\"\n\n\n \"Easy, baby,\" I said. I  knew what our ace in the hole  was. But I had to get Ledman  within reach of me first.\n\n\n \"Enough,\" he said. \"I'm going  to turn you loose outside,  right after\u2014\"\n\n\n \" Get sick! \" I hissed to Val,  low. She began immediately  to cough violently, emitting  harsh, choking sobs. \"Can't  breathe!\" She began to yell,  writhing in her bonds.\n\n\n That did it. Ledman hadn't  much humanity left in him,  but there was a little. He lowered  the blaster a bit and  wheeled one-hand over to see  what was wrong with Val.  She continued to retch and  moan most horribly. It almost  convinced me. I saw Val's  pale, frightened face turn to  me.\n\n\n He approached and peered  down at her. He opened his  mouth to say something, and  at that moment I snapped my  leg up hard, tearing the tangle-cord  with a snicking rasp,  and kicked his wheelchair  over.\n\n\n The blaster went off, burning  a hole through the Dome  roof. The automatic sealers  glued-in instantly. Ledman  went sprawling helplessly out  into the middle of the floor,  the wheelchair upended next  to him, its wheels slowly revolving  in the air. The blaster  flew from his hands at the  impact of landing and spun  out near me. In one quick motion  I rolled over and covered  it with my body. Ledman clawed his way to  me with tremendous effort  and tried wildly to pry the  blaster out from under me,  but without success. I twisted  a bit, reached out with my  free leg, and booted him  across the floor. He fetched  up against the wall of the  Dome and lay there.\n\n\n Val rolled over to me.\n\n\n \"Now if I could get free of  this stuff,\" I said, \"I could get  him covered before he comes  to. But how?\"\n\n\n \"Teamwork,\" Val said. She  swivelled around on the floor  until her head was near my  boot. \"Push my oxymask off  with your foot, if you can.\"\n\n\n I searched for the clamp  and tried to flip it. No luck,  with my heavy, clumsy boot.  I tried again, and this time it  snapped open. I got the tip  of my boot in and pried upward.  The oxymask came off,  slowly, scraping a jagged red  scratch up the side of Val's  neck as it came.\n\n\n \"There,\" she breathed.  \"That's that.\"\n\n\n I looked uneasily at Ledman.  He was groaning and  beginning to stir.\n\n\n Val rolled on the floor and  her face lay near my right  arm. I saw what she had in  mind. She began to nibble the  vile-tasting tangle-cord, running  her teeth up and down  it until it started to give. She  continued unfailingly.\n\n\n Finally one strand snapped.  Then another. At last I  had enough use of my hand  to reach out and grasp the  blaster. Then I pulled myself  across the floor to Ledman,  removed the tanglegun, and  melted the remaining tangle-cord  off.\n\n\n My muscles were stiff and  bunched, and rising made me  wince. I turned and freed Val.  Then I turned and faced Ledman.\n\n\n \"I suppose you'll kill me  now,\" he said.\n\n\n \"No. That's the difference  between sane people and insane,\"  I told him. \"I'm not  going to kill you at all. I'm  going to see to it that you're  sent back to Earth.\"\n\n\n \" No! \" he shouted. \"No!  Anything but back there. I  don't want to face them again\u2014not  after what they did to  me\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not so loud,\" I broke in.  \"They'll help you on Earth.  They'll take all the hatred and  sickness out of you, and turn  you into a useful member of  society again.\"\n\n\n \"I hate Earthmen,\" he spat  out. \"I hate all of them.\"\n\n\n \"I know,\" I said sarcastically.  \"You're just all full of  hate. You hated us so much  that you couldn't bear to hang  around on Earth for as much  as a year after the Sadlerville  Blast. You had to take right  off for Mars without a moment's  delay, didn't you? You  hated Earth so much you had to leave.\"\n\n\n \"Why are you telling all  this to me?\"\n\n\n \"Because if you'd stayed  long enough, you'd have used  some of your pension money  to buy yourself a pair of prosthetic  legs, and then you  wouldn't need this wheelchair.\"\n\n\n Ledman scowled, and then  his face went belligerent  again. \"They told me I was  paralyzed below the waist.  That I'd never walk again,  even with prosthetic legs, because  I had no muscles to fit  them to.\"\n\n\n \"You left Earth too quickly,\"  Val said.\n\n\n \"It was the only way,\" he  protested. \"I had to get off\u2014\"\n\n\n \"She's right,\" I told him.  \"The atom can take away, but  it can give as well. Soon after  you left they developed atomic-powered prosthetics\u2014amazing  things, virtually robot  legs. All the survivors of  the Sadlerville Blast were  given the necessary replacement  limbs free of charge. All  except you. You were so sick  you had to get away from the  world you despised and come  here.\"\n\n\n \"You're lying,\" he said.  \"It's not true!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, but it is,\" Val smiled.\n\n\n I saw him wilt visibly, and  for a moment I almost felt  sorry for him, a pathetic legless  figure propped up against  the wall of the Dome at  blaster-point. But then I remembered  he'd killed twelve  Geigs\u2014or more\u2014and would  have added Val to the number  had he had the chance. \"You're a very sick man,  Ledman,\" I said. \"All this  time you could have been  happy, useful on Earth, instead  of being holed up here  nursing your hatred. You  might have been useful, on  Earth. But you decided to  channel everything out as revenge.\"\n\n\n \"I still don't believe it\u2014those  legs. I might have walked  again. No\u2014no, it's all a lie.  They told me I'd never walk,\"  he said, weakly but stubbornly  still.\n\n\n I could see his whole structure  of hate starting to topple,  and I decided to give it  the final push.\n\n\n \"Haven't you wondered  how I managed to break the  tangle-cord when I kicked you  over?\"\n\n\n \"Yes\u2014human legs aren't  strong enough to break tangle-cord  that way.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I said. I  gave Val the blaster and slipped  out of my oxysuit.  \"Look,\" I said. I pointed to  my smooth, gleaming metal  legs. The almost soundless  purr of their motors was the  only noise in the room. \"I was  in the Sadlerville Blast, too,\"  I said. \"But I didn't go crazy  with hate when I lost my legs.\"\n\n\n Ledman was sobbing.\n\n\n \"Okay, Ledman,\" I said.  Val got him into his suit, and  brought him the fishbowl helmet.  \"Get your helmet on and  let's go. Between the psychs  and the prosthetics men,  you'll be a new man inside of  a year.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm a murderer!\"\n\n\n \"That's right. And you'll be  sentenced to psych adjustment.  When they're finished,  Gregory Ledman the killer  will be as dead as if they'd  electrocuted you, but there'll  be a new\u2014and sane\u2014Gregory  Ledman.\" I turned to Val.\n\n\n \"Got the geigers, honey?\"\n\n\n For the first time since  Ledman had caught us, I remembered  how tired Val had  been out on the desert. I realized  now that I had been driving  her mercilessly\u2014me, with  my chromium legs and atomic-powered  muscles. No wonder  she was ready to fold!  And I'd been too dense to see  how unfair I had been.\n\n\n She lifted the geiger harnesses,  and I put Ledman  back in his wheelchair.\n\n\n Val slipped her oxymask  back on and fastened it shut.\n\n\n \"Let's get back to the Dome  in a hurry,\" I said. \"We'll  turn Ledman over to the authorities.  Then we can catch  the next ship for Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Go back? Go back? If you  think I'm backing down now  and quitting you can find  yourself another wife! After  we dump this guy I'm sacking  in for twenty hours, and then  we're going back out there to  finish that search-pattern.  Earth needs uranium, honey,  and I know you'd never be  happy quitting in the middle  like that.\" She smiled. \"I  can't wait to get out there  and start listening for those  tell-tale clicks.\"\n\n\n I gave a joyful whoop and  swung her around. When I  put her down, she squeezed  my hand, hard.\n\n\n \"Let's get moving, fellow  hero,\" she said.\n\n\n I pressed the stud for the  airlock, smiling.
