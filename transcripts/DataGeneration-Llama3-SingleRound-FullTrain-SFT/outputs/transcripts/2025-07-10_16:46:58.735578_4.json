      "background_text": "THE FIRST ONE By HERBERT D. KASTLE Illustrated by von Dongen [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Analog July 1961.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] The first man to return from beyond the Great Frontier may be  welcomed ... but will it be as a curiosity, rather than as a  hero...? There was the usual welcoming crowd for a celebrity, and the usual  speeches by the usual politicians who met him at the airport which had  once been twenty miles outside of Croton, but which the growing city had  since engulfed and placed well within its boundaries. But everything  wasn't usual. The crowd was quiet, and the mayor didn't seem quite as  at-ease as he'd been on his last big welcoming\u2014for Corporal Berringer,  one of the crew of the spaceship Washington , first to set Americans  upon Mars. His Honor's handclasp was somewhat moist and cold. His  Honor's eyes held a trace of remoteness.\n\n\n Still, he was the honored home-comer, the successful returnee, the  hometown boy who had made good in a big way, and they took the triumphal  tour up Main Street to the new square and the grandstand. There he sat  between the mayor and a nervous young coed chosen as homecoming queen,  and looked out at the police and fire department bands, the National  Guard, the boy scouts and girl scouts, the Elks and Masons. Several of  the churches in town had shown indecision as to how to instruct their  parishioners to treat him. But they had all come around. The tremendous  national interest, the fact that he was the First One, had made them  come around. It was obvious by now that they would have to adjust as  they'd adjusted to all the other firsts taking place in these\u2014as the  newspapers had dubbed the start of the Twenty-first Century\u2014the  Galloping Twenties.\n\n\n He was glad when the official greeting was over. He was a very tired man  and he had come farther, traveled longer and over darker country, than  any man who'd ever lived before. He wanted a meal at his own table, a  kiss from his wife, a word from his son, and later to see some old  friends and a relative or two. He didn't want to talk about the journey.  He wanted to forget the immediacy, the urgency, the terror; then perhaps  he would talk.\n\n\n Or would he? For he had very little to tell. He had traveled and he had  returned and his voyage was very much like the voyages of the great  mariners, from Columbus onward\u2014long, dull periods of time passing,  passing, and then the arrival.\n\n\n The house had changed. He saw that as soon as the official car let him  off at 45 Roosevelt Street. The change was, he knew, for the better.  They had put a porch in front. They had rehabilitated, spruced up,  almost rebuilt the entire outside and grounds. But he was sorry. He had  wanted it to be as before.\n\n\n The head of the American Legion and the chief of police, who had  escorted him on this trip from the square, didn't ask to go in with him.  He was glad. He'd had enough of strangers. Not that he was through with  strangers. There were dozens of them up and down the street, standing  beside parked cars, looking at him. But when he looked back at them,  their eyes dropped, they turned away, they began moving off. He was  still too much the First One to have his gaze met.\n\n\n He walked up what had once been a concrete path and was now an ornate  flagstone path. He climbed the new porch and raised the ornamental  knocker on the new door and heard the soft music sound within. He was  surprised that he'd had to do this. He'd thought Edith would be watching  at a window.\n\n\n And perhaps she had been watching ... but she hadn't opened the door.\n\n\n The door opened; he looked at her. It hadn't been too long and she  hadn't changed at all. She was still the small, slender girl he'd loved  in high school, the small, slender woman he'd married twelve years ago.  Ralphie was with her. They held onto each other as if seeking mutual  support, the thirty-three-year old woman and ten-year-old boy. They  looked at him, and then both moved forward, still together. He said,  \"It's good to be home!\"\n\n\n Edith nodded and, still holding to Ralphie with one hand, put the other  arm around him. He kissed her\u2014her neck, her cheek\u2014and all the old  jokes came to mind, the jokes of travel-weary, battle-weary men, the  and- then -I'll-put-my-pack-aside jokes that spoke of terrible hunger.  She was trembling, and even as her lips came up to touch his he felt the  difference, and because of this difference he turned with urgency to  Ralphie and picked him up and hugged him and said, because he could  think of nothing else to say, \"What a big fella, what a big fella.\"\n\n\n Ralphie stood in his arms as if his feet were still planted on the  floor, and he didn't look at his father but somewhere beyond him. \"I  didn't grow much while you were gone, Dad, Mom says I don't eat enough.\"\n\n\n So he put him down and told himself that it would all change, that  everything would loosen up just as his commanding officer, General  Carlisle, had said it would early this morning before he left  Washington.\n\n\n \"Give it some time,\" Carlisle had said. \"You need the time; they need  the time. And for the love of heaven, don't be sensitive.\" Edith was leading him into the living room, her hand lying still in his,  a cool, dead bird lying still in his. He sat down on the couch, she sat  down beside him\u2014but she had hesitated. He wasn't being sensitive; she  had hesitated. His wife had hesitated before sitting down beside him.\n\n\n Carlisle had said his position was analogous to Columbus', to Vasco De  Gama's, to Preshoff's when the Russian returned from the Moon\u2014but more  so. Carlisle had said lots of things, but even Carlisle who had worked  with him all the way, who had engineered the entire fantastic  journey\u2014even Carlisle the Nobel prize winner, the multi-degreed genius  in uniform, had not actually spoken to him as one man to another. The eyes. It always showed in their eyes. He looked across the room at Ralphie, standing in the doorway, a boy  already tall, already widening in the shoulders, already large of  feature. It was like looking into the mirror and seeing himself  twenty-five years ago. But Ralphie's face was drawn, was worried in a  way that few ten-year-old faces are.\n\n\n \"How's it going in school?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Gee, Dad, it's the second month of summer vacation.\"\n\n\n \"Well, then, before summer vacation?\"\n\n\n \"Pretty good.\"\n\n\n Edith said, \"He made top forum the six-month period before vacation, and  he made top forum the six-month period you went away, Hank.\"\n\n\n He nodded, remembering that, remembering everything, remembering the  warmth of her farewell, the warmth of Ralphie's farewell, their tears as  he left for the experimental flight station in the Aleutians. They had  feared for him, having read of the many launchings gone wrong even in  continent-to-continent experimental flight.\n\n\n They had been right to worry. He had suffered much after that blow-up.  But now they should be rejoicing, because he had survived and made the  long journey. Ralphie suddenly said, \"I got to go, Dad. I promised Walt  and the others I'd pitch. It's Inter-Town Little League, you know. It's  Harmon, you know. I got to keep my word.\" Without waiting for an answer,  he waved his hand\u2014it shook; a ten-year-old boy's hand that shook\u2014and  ran from the room and from the house.\n\n\n He and Edith sat beside each other, and he wanted badly to take her in  his arms, and yet he didn't want to oppress her. He stood up. \"I'm very  tired. I'd like to lie down a while.\" Which wasn't true, because he'd  been lying down all the months of the way back.\n\n\n She said, \"Of course. How stupid of me, expecting you to sit around and  make small talk and pick up just where you left off.\"\n\n\n He nodded. But that was exactly what he wanted to do\u2014make small talk  and pick up just where he'd left off. But they didn't expect it of him;  they wouldn't let him; they felt he had changed too much. She led him upstairs and along the foyer past Ralphie's room and past  the small guest room to their bedroom. This, too, had changed. It was  newly painted and it had new furniture. He saw twin beds separated by an  ornate little table with an ornate little lamp, and this looked more  ominous a barrier to him than the twelve-foot concrete-and-barbed-wire  fence around the experimental station.\n\n\n \"Which one is mine,\" he asked, and tried to smile.\n\n\n She also tried to smile. \"The one near the window. You always liked the  fresh air, the sunshine in the morning. You always said it helped you  to get up on time when you were stationed at the base outside of town.  You always said it reminded you\u2014being able to see the sky\u2014that you  were going to go up in it, and that you were going to come down from it  to this bed again.\"\n\n\n \"Not this bed,\" he murmured, and was a little sorry afterward.\n\n\n \"No, not this bed,\" she said quickly. \"Your lodge donated the bedroom  set and I really didn't know\u2014\" She waved her hand, her face white.\n\n\n He was sure then that she had known, and that the beds and the barrier  between them were her own choice, if only an unconscious choice. He went  to the bed near the window, stripped off his Air Force blue jacket,  began to take off his shirt, but then remembered that some arm scars  still showed. He waited for her to leave the room.\n\n\n She said, \"Well then, rest up, dear,\" and went out.\n\n\n He took off his shirt and saw himself in the mirror on the opposite  wall; and then took off his under-shirt. The body scars were faint, the  scars running in long lines, one dissecting his chest, the other slicing  diagonally across his upper abdomen to disappear under his trousers.  There were several more on his back, and one on his right thigh. They'd  been treated properly and would soon disappear. But she had never seen  them.\n\n\n Perhaps she never would. Perhaps pajamas and robes and dark rooms would  keep them from her until they were gone.\n\n\n Which was not what he'd considered at all important on leaving Walter  Reed Hospital early this morning; which was something he found  distasteful, something he felt beneath them both. And, at the same time,  he began to understand that there would be many things, previously  beneath them both, which would have to be considered. She had changed;  Ralphie had changed; all the people he knew had probably  changed\u2014because they thought he had changed.\n\n\n He was tired of thinking. He lay down and closed his eyes. He let  himself taste bitterness, unhappiness, a loneliness he had never known  before.\n\n\n But sometime later, as he was dozing off, a sense of reassurance began  filtering into his mind. After all, he was still Henry Devers, the same  man who had left home eleven months ago, with a love for family and  friends which was, if anything, stronger than before. Once he could  communicate this, the strangeness would disappear and the First One  would again become good old Hank. It was little enough to ask for\u2014a  return to old values, old relationships, the normalcies of the backwash  instead of the freneticisms of the lime-light. It would certainly be  granted to him.\n\n\n He slept. Dinner was at seven  p.m.  His mother came; his Uncle Joe and Aunt Lucille  came. Together with Edith, Ralphie and himself, they made six, and ate  in the dining room at the big table.\n\n\n Before he'd become the First One, it would have been a noisy affair. His  family had never been noted for a lack of ebullience, a lack of  talkativeness, and Ralphie had always chosen mealtimes\u2014especially with  company present\u2014to describe everything and anything that had happened  to him during the day. And Edith herself had always chatted, especially  with his mother, though they didn't agree about much. Still, it had been  good-natured; the general tone of their lives had been good-natured.\n\n\n This wasn't good-natured. Exactly what it was he wasn't sure. \"Stiff\"  was perhaps the word.\n\n\n They began with grapefruit, Edith and Mother serving quickly,  efficiently from the kitchen, then sitting down at the table. He looked  at Mother as he raised his first spoonful of chilled fruit, and said,  \"Younger than ever.\" It was nothing new; he'd said it many many times  before, but his mother had always reacted with a bright smile and a quip  something like, \"Young for the Golden Age Center, you mean.\" This time  she burst into tears. It shocked him. But what shocked him even more was  the fact that no one looked up, commented, made any attempt to comfort  her; no one indicated in any way that a woman was sobbing at the table.\n\n\n He was sitting directly across from Mother, and reached out and touched  her left hand which lay limply beside the silverware. She didn't move  it\u2014she hadn't touched him once beyond that first, quick, strangely-cool  embrace at the door\u2014then a few seconds later she withdrew it and let it  drop out of sight.\n\n\n So there he was, Henry Devers, at home with the family. So there he was,  the hero returned, waiting to be treated as a human being.\n\n\n The grapefruit shells were cleaned away and the soup served. Uncle Joe  began to talk. \"The greatest little development of circular uniform  houses you ever did see,\" he boomed in his powerful salesman's voice.  \"Still going like sixty. We'll sell out before\u2014\" At that point he  looked at Hank, and Hank nodded encouragement, desperately interested in  this normalcy, and Joe's voice died away. He looked down at his plate,  mumbled, \"Soup's getting cold,\" and began to eat. His hand shook a  little; his ruddy face was not quite as ruddy as Hank remembered it.\n\n\n Aunt Lucille made a few quavering statements about the Ladies' Tuesday  Garden Club, and Hank looked across the table to where she sat between  Joe and Mother\u2014his wife and son bracketed him, and yet he felt  alone\u2014and said, \"I've missed fooling around with the lawn and the rose  bushes. Here it is August and I haven't had my hand to a mower or  trowel.\"\n\n\n Aunt Lucille smiled, if you could call it that\u2014a pitiful twitching of  the lips\u2014and nodded. She threw her eyes in his direction, and past him,  and then down to her plate. Mother, who was still sniffling, said, \"I  have a dismal headache. I'm going to lie down in the guest room a  while.\" She touched his shoulder in passing\u2014his affectionate, effusive  mother who would kiss stray dogs and strange children, who had often  irritated him with an excess of physical and verbal caresses\u2014she barely  touched his shoulder and fled.\n\n\n So now five of them sat at the table. The meat was served\u2014thin, rare  slices of beef, the pink blood-juice oozing warmly from the center. He  cut into it and raised a forkful to his mouth, then glanced at Ralphie  and said, \"Looks fresh enough to have been killed in the back yard.\"  Ralphie said, \"Yeah, Dad.\" Aunt Lucille put down her knife and fork and  murmured something to her husband. Joe cleared his throat and said  Lucille was rapidly becoming a vegetarian and he guessed she was going  into the living room for a while. \"She'll be back for dessert, of  course,\" he said, his laugh sounding forced.\n\n\n Hank looked at Edith; Edith was busy with her plate. Hank looked at  Ralphie; Ralphie was busy with his plate. Hank looked at Joe; Joe was  chewing, gazing out over their heads to the kitchen. Hank looked at  Lucille; she was disappearing into the living room.\n\n\n He brought his fist down on the table. The settings jumped; a glass  overturned, spilling water. He brought it down again and again. They  were all standing now. He sat there and pounded the table with his big  right fist\u2014Henry Devers, who would never have thought of making such a  scene before, but who was now so sick and tired of being treated as the  First One, of being stood back from, looked at in awe of, felt in fear  of, that he could have smashed more than a table.\n\n\n Edith said, \"Hank!\"\n\n\n He said, voice hoarse, \"Shut up. Go away. Let me eat alone. I'm sick of  the lot of you.\" Mother and Joe returned a few minutes later where he sat forcing food  down his throat. Mother said, \"Henry dear\u2014\" He didn't answer. She began  to cry, and he was glad she left the house then. He had never said  anything really bad to his mother. He was afraid this would have been  the time. Joe merely cleared his throat and mumbled something about  getting together again soon and \"drop out and see the new development\"  and he, too, was gone. Lucille never did manage to speak to him.\n\n\n He finished his beef and waited. Soon Edith came in with the special  dessert she'd been preparing half the day\u2014a magnificent English trifle.  She served him, and spooned out a portion for herself and Ralphie. She  hesitated near his chair, and when he made no comment she called the  boy. Then the three of them were sitting, facing the empty side of the  table. They ate the trifle. Ralphie finished first and got up and said,  \"Hey, I promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You promised the boys you'd play baseball or football or handball or  something; anything to get away from your father.\"\n\n\n Ralphie's head dropped and he muttered, \"Aw, no, Dad.\"\n\n\n Edith said, \"He'll stay home, Hank. We'll spend an evening  together\u2014talking, watching TV, playing Monopoly.\"\n\n\n Ralphie said, \"Gee, sure, Dad, if you want to.\"\n\n\n Hank stood up. \"The question is not whether I want to. You both know I  want to. The question is whether you want to.\"\n\n\n They answered together that of course they wanted to. But their  eyes\u2014his wife's and son's eyes\u2014could not meet his, and so he said he  was going to his room because he was, after all, very tired and would in  all probability continue to be very tired for a long, long time and that  they shouldn't count on him for normal social life.\n\n\n He fell asleep quickly, lying there in his clothes.\n\n\n But he didn't sleep long. Edith shook him and he opened his eyes to a  lighted room. \"Phil and Rhona are here.\" He blinked at her. She smiled,  and it seemed her old smile. \"They're so anxious to see you, Hank. I  could barely keep Phil from coming up and waking you himself. They want  to go out and do the town. Please, Hank, say you will.\"\n\n\n He sat up. \"Phil,\" he muttered. \"Phil and Rhona.\" They'd had wonderful  times together, from grammar school on. Phil and Rhona, their oldest and  closest friends. Perhaps this would begin his real homecoming.\n\n\n Do the town? They'd paint it and then tear it down! It didn't turn out that way. He was disappointed; but then again, he'd  also expected it. This entire first day at home had conditioned him to  expect nothing good. They went to the bowling alleys, and Phil sounded  very much the way he always had\u2014soft spoken and full of laughter and  full of jokes. He patted Edith on the head the way he always had, and  clapped Hank on the shoulder (but not the way he always had\u2014so much  more gently, almost remotely), and insisted they all drink more than was  good for them as he always had. And for once, Hank was ready to go along  on the drinking. For once, he matched Phil shot for shot, beer for beer.\n\n\n They didn't bowl very long. At ten o'clock they crossed the road to  Manfred's Tavern, where Phil and the girls ordered sandwiches and coffee  and Hank went right on drinking. Edith said something to him, but he  merely smiled and waved his hand and gulped another ounce of nirvana.\n\n\n There was dancing to a juke box in Manfred's Tavern. He'd been there  many times before, and he was sure several of the couples recognized  him. But except for a few abortive glances in his direction, it was as  if he were a stranger in a city halfway around the world.\n\n\n At midnight, he was still drinking. The others wanted to leave, but he  said, \"I haven't danced with my girl Rhona.\" His tongue was thick, his  mind was blurred, and yet he could read the strange expression on her  face\u2014pretty Rhona, who'd always flirted with him, who'd made a ritual  of flirting with him. Pretty Rhona, who now looked as if she were going  to be sick.\n\n\n \"So let's rock,\" he said and stood up.\n\n\n They were on the dance floor. He held her close, and hummed and chatted.  And through the alcoholic haze saw she was a stiff-smiled, stiff-bodied,  mechanical dancing doll.\n\n\n The number finished; they walked back to the booth. Phil said,  \"Beddy-bye time.\"\n\n\n Hank said, \"First one dance with my loving wife.\"\n\n\n He and Edith danced. He didn't hold her close as he had Rhona. He waited  for her to come close on her own, and she did, and yet she didn't.  Because while she put herself against him, there was something in her  face\u2014no, in her eyes; it always showed in the eyes\u2014that made him know  she was trying to be the old Edith and not succeeding. This time when  the music ended, he was ready to go home.\n\n\n They rode back to town along Route Nine, he and Edith in the rear of  Phil's car, Rhona driving because Phil had drunk just a little too much,  Phil singing and telling an occasional bad joke, and somehow not his old  self. No one was his old self. No one would ever be his old self with  the First One.\n\n\n They turned left, to take the short cut along Hallowed Hill Road, and  Phil finished a story about a Martian and a Hollywood sex queen and  looked at his wife and then past her at the long, cast-iron fence  paralleling the road. \"Hey,\" he said, pointing, \"do you know why that's  the most popular place on earth?\"\n\n\n Rhona glanced to the left, and so did Hank and Edith. Rhona made a  little sound, and Edith seemed to stop breathing, but Phil went on a  while longer, not yet aware of his supposed faux pas .\n\n\n \"You know why?\" he repeated, turning to the back seat, the laughter  rumbling up from his chest. \"You know why, folks?\"\n\n\n Rhona said, \"Did you notice Carl Braken and his wife at\u2014\"\n\n\n Hank said, \"No, Phil, why is it the most popular place on earth?\"\n\n\n Phil said, \"Because people are\u2014\" And then he caught himself and waved  his hand and muttered, \"I forgot the punch line.\"\n\n\n \"Because people are dying to get in,\" Hank said, and looked through the  window, past the iron fence, into the large cemetery at the fleeting  tombstones.\n\n\n The car was filled with horrified silence when there should have been  nothing but laughter, or irritation at a too-old joke. \"Maybe you should  let me out right here,\" Hank said. \"I'm home\u2014or that's what everyone  seems to think. Maybe I should lie down in an open grave. Maybe that  would satisfy people. Maybe that's the only way to act, like Dracula or  another monster from the movies.\"\n\n\n Edith said, \"Oh, Hank, don't, don't!\"\n\n\n The car raced along the road, crossed a macadam highway, went four  blocks and pulled to a stop. He didn't bother saying good night. He  didn't wait for Edith. He just got out and walked up the flagstone path  and entered the house. \"Hank,\" Edith whispered from the guest room doorway, \"I'm so sorry\u2014\"\n\n\n \"There's nothing to be sorry about. It's just a matter of time. It'll  all work out in time.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said quickly, \"that's it. I need a little time. We all need a  little time. Because it's so strange, Hank. Because it's so frightening.  I should have told you that the moment you walked in. I think I've hurt  you terribly, we've all hurt you terribly, by trying to hide that we're  frightened.\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to stay in the guest room,\" he said, \"for as long as  necessary. For good if need be.\"\n\n\n \"How could it be for good? How, Hank?\"\n\n\n That question was perhaps the first firm basis for hope he'd had since  returning. And there was something else; what Carlisle had told him,  even as Carlisle himself had reacted as all men did.\n\n\n \"There are others coming, Edith. Eight that I know of in the tanks right  now. My superior, Captain Davidson, who died at the same moment I  did\u2014seven months ago next Wednesday\u2014he's going to be next. He was  smashed up worse than I was, so it took a little longer, but he's almost  ready. And there'll be many more, Edith. The government is going to save  all they possibly can from now on. Every time a young and healthy man  loses his life by accident, by violence, and his body can be recovered,  he'll go into the tanks and they'll start the regenerative brain and  organ process\u2014the process that made it all possible. So people have to  get used to us. And the old stories, the old terrors, the ugly old  superstitions have to die, because in time each place will have some of  us; because in time it'll be an ordinary thing.\"\n\n\n Edith said, \"Yes, and I'm so grateful that you're here, Hank. Please  believe that. Please be patient with me and Ralphie and\u2014\" She paused.  \"There's one question.\"\n\n\n He knew what the question was. It had been the first asked him by  everyone from the president of the United States on down.\n\n\n \"I saw nothing,\" he said. \"It was as if I slept those six and a half  months\u2014slept without dreaming.\"\n\n\n She came to him and touched his face with her lips, and he was  satisfied.\n\n\n Later, half asleep, he heard a dog howling, and remembered stories of  how they announced death and the presence of monsters. He shivered and  pulled the covers closer to him and luxuriated in being safe in his own  home. THE END ",

KASTLE Illustrated by von Dongen [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Analog July 1961.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] The first man to return from beyond the Great Frontier may be  welcomed ... but will it be as a curiosity, rather than as a  hero...? There was the usual welcoming crowd for a celebrity, and the usual  speeches by the usual politicians who met him at the airport which had  once been twenty miles outside of Croton, but which the growing city had  since engulfed and placed well within its boundaries. But everything  wasn't usual. The crowd was quiet, and the mayor didn't seem quite as  at-ease as he'd been on his last big welcoming\u2014for Corporal Berringer,  one of the crew of the spaceship Washington , first to set Americans  upon Mars. His Honor's handclasp was somewhat moist and cold. His  Honor's eyes held a trace of remoteness.\n\n\n Still, he was the honored home-comer, the successful returnee, the  hometown boy who had made good in a big way, and they took the triumphal  tour up Main Street to the new square and the grandstand. There he sat  between the mayor and a nervous young coed chosen as homecoming queen,  and looked out at the police and fire department bands, the National  Guard, the boy scouts and girl scouts, the Elks and Masons. Several of  the churches in town had shown indecision as to how to instruct their  parishioners to treat him. But they had all come around. The tremendous  national interest, the fact that he was the First One, had made them  come around. It was obvious by now that they would have to adjust as  they'd adjusted to all the other firsts taking place in these\u2014as the  newspapers had dubbed the start of the Twenty-first Century\u2014the  Galloping Twenties.\n\n\n He was glad when the official greeting was over. He was a very tired man  and he had come farther, traveled longer and over darker country, than  any man who'd ever lived before. He wanted a meal at his own table, a  kiss from his wife, a word from his son, and later to see some old  friends and a relative or two. He didn't want to talk about the journey.  He wanted to forget the immediacy, the urgency, the terror; then perhaps  he would talk.\n\n\n Or would he? For he had very little to tell. He had traveled and he had  returned and his voyage was very much like the voyages of the great  mariners, from Columbus onward\u2014long, dull periods of time passing,  passing, and then the arrival.\n\n\n The house had changed. He saw that as soon as the official car let him  off at 45 Roosevelt Street. The change was, he knew, for the better.  They had put a porch in front. They had rehabilitated, spruced up,  almost rebuilt the entire outside and grounds. But he was sorry. He had  wanted it to be as before.\n\n\n The head of the American Legion and the chief of police, who had  escorted him on this trip from the square, didn't ask to go in with him.  He was glad. He'd had enough of strangers. Not that he was through with  strangers. There were dozens of them up and down the street, standing  beside parked cars, looking at him. But when he looked back at them,  their eyes dropped, they turned away, they began moving off. He was  still too much the First One to have his gaze met.\n\n\n He walked up what had once been a concrete path and was now an ornate  flagstone path. He climbed the new porch and raised the ornamental  knocker on the new door and heard the soft music sound within. He was  surprised that he'd had to do this. He'd thought Edith would be watching  at a window.\n\n\n And perhaps she had been watching ... but she hadn't opened the door.\n\n\n The door opened; he looked at her. It hadn't been too long and she  hadn't changed at all. She was still the small, slender girl he'd loved  in high school, the small, slender woman he'd married twelve years ago.  Ralphie was with her. They held onto each other as if seeking mutual  support, the thirty-three-year old woman and ten-year-old boy. They  looked at him, and then both moved forward, still together. He said,  \"It's good to be home!\"\n\n\n Edith nodded and, still holding to Ralphie with one hand, put the other  arm around him. He kissed her\u2014her neck, her cheek\u2014and all the old  jokes came to mind, the jokes of travel-weary, battle-weary men, the  and- then -I'll-put-my-pack-aside jokes that spoke of terrible hunger.  She was trembling, and even as her lips came up to touch his he felt the  difference, and because of this difference he turned with urgency to  Ralphie and picked him up and hugged him and said, because he could  think of nothing else to say, \"What a big fella, what a big fella.\"\n\n\n Ralphie stood in his arms as if his feet were still planted on the  floor, and he didn't look at his father but somewhere beyond him. \"I  didn't grow much while you were gone, Dad, Mom says I don't eat enough.\"\n\n\n So he put him down and told himself that it would all change, that  everything would loosen up just as his commanding officer, General  Carlisle, had said it would early this morning before he left  Washington.\n\n\n \"Give it some time,\" Carlisle had said. \"You need the time; they need  the time. And for the love of heaven, don't be sensitive.\" Edith was leading him into the living room, her hand lying still in his,  a cool, dead bird lying still in his. He sat down on the couch, she sat  down beside him\u2014but she had hesitated. He wasn't being sensitive; she  had hesitated. His wife had hesitated before sitting down beside him.\n\n\n Carlisle had said his position was analogous to Columbus', to Vasco De  Gama's, to Preshoff's when the Russian returned from the Moon\u2014but more  so. Carlisle had said lots of things, but even Carlisle who had worked  with him all the way, who had engineered the entire fantastic  journey\u2014even Carlisle the Nobel prize winner, the multi-degreed genius  in uniform, had not actually spoken to him as one man to another. The eyes. It always showed in their eyes. He looked across the room at Ralphie, standing in the doorway, a boy  already tall, already widening in the shoulders, already large of  feature. It was like looking into the mirror and seeing himself  twenty-five years ago. But Ralphie's face was drawn, was worried in a  way that few ten-year-old faces are.\n\n\n \"How's it going in school?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Gee, Dad, it's the second month of summer vacation.\"\n\n\n \"Well, then, before summer vacation?\"\n\n\n \"Pretty good.\"\n\n\n Edith said, \"He made top forum the six-month period before vacation, and  he made top forum the six-month period you went away, Hank.\"\n\n\n He nodded, remembering that, remembering everything, remembering the  warmth of her farewell, the warmth of Ralphie's farewell, their tears as  he left for the experimental flight station in the Aleutians. They had  feared for him, having read of the many launchings gone wrong even in  continent-to-continent experimental flight.\n\n\n They had been right to worry. He had suffered much after that blow-up.  But now they should be rejoicing, because he had survived and made the  long journey. Ralphie suddenly said, \"I got to go, Dad. I promised Walt  and the others I'd pitch. It's Inter-Town Little League, you know. It's  Harmon, you know. I got to keep my word.\" Without waiting for an answer,  he waved his hand\u2014it shook; a ten-year-old boy's hand that shook\u2014and  ran from the room and from the house.\n\n\n He and Edith sat beside each other, and he wanted badly to take her in  his arms, and yet he didn't want to oppress her. He stood up. \"I'm very  tired. I'd like to lie down a while.\" Which wasn't true, because he'd  been lying down all the months of the way back.\n\n\n She said, \"Of course. How stupid of me, expecting you to sit around and  make small talk and pick up just where you left off.\"\n\n\n He nodded. But that was exactly what he wanted to do\u2014make small talk  and pick up just where he'd left off. But they didn't expect it of him;  they wouldn't let him; they felt he had changed too much. She led him upstairs and along the foyer past Ralphie's room and past  the small guest room to their bedroom. This, too, had changed. It was  newly painted and it had new furniture. He saw twin beds separated by an  ornate little table with an ornate little lamp, and this looked more  ominous a barrier to him than the twelve-foot concrete-and-barbed-wire  fence around the experimental station.\n\n\n \"Which one is mine,\" he asked, and tried to smile.\n\n\n She also tried to smile. \"The one near the window. You always liked the  fresh air, the sunshine in the morning. You always said it helped you  to get up on time when you were stationed at the base outside of town.  You always said it reminded you\u2014being able to see the sky\u2014that you  were going to go up in it, and that you were going to come down from it  to this bed again.\"\n\n\n \"Not this bed,\" he murmured, and was a little sorry afterward.\n\n\n \"No, not this bed,\" she said quickly. \"Your lodge donated the bedroom  set and I really didn't know\u2014\" She waved her hand, her face white.\n\n\n He was sure then that she had known, and that the beds and the barrier  between them were her own choice, if only an unconscious choice. He went  to the bed near the window, stripped off his Air Force blue jacket,  began to take off his shirt, but then remembered that some arm scars  still showed. He waited for her to leave the room.\n\n\n She said, \"Well then, rest up, dear,\" and went out.\n\n\n He took off his shirt and saw himself in the mirror on the opposite  wall; and then took off his under-shirt. The body scars were faint, the  scars running in long lines, one dissecting his chest, the other slicing  diagonally across his upper abdomen to disappear under his trousers.  There were several more on his back, and one on his right thigh. They'd  been treated properly and would soon disappear. But she had never seen  them.\n\n\n Perhaps she never would. Perhaps pajamas and robes and dark rooms would  keep them from her until they were gone.\n\n\n Which was not what he'd considered at all important on leaving Walter  Reed Hospital early this morning; which was something he found  distasteful, something he felt beneath them both. And, at the same time,  he began to understand that there would be many things, previously  beneath them both, which would have to be considered. She had changed;  Ralphie had changed; all the people he knew had probably  changed\u2014because they thought he had changed.\n\n\n He was tired of thinking. He lay down and closed his eyes. He let  himself taste bitterness, unhappiness, a loneliness he had never known  before.\n\n\n But sometime later, as he was dozing off, a sense of reassurance began  filtering into his mind. After all, he was still Henry Devers, the same  man who had left home eleven months ago, with a love for family and  friends which was, if anything, stronger than before. Once he could  communicate this, the strangeness would disappear and the First One  would again become good old Hank. It was little enough to ask for\u2014a  return to old values, old relationships, the normalcies of the backwash  instead of the freneticisms of the lime-light. It would certainly be  granted to him.\n\n\n He slept. Dinner was at seven  p.m.  His mother came; his Uncle Joe and Aunt Lucille  came. Together with Edith, Ralphie and himself, they made six, and ate  in the dining room at the big table.\n\n\n Before he'd become the First One, it would have been a noisy affair. His  family had never been noted for a lack of ebullience, a lack of  talkativeness, and Ralphie had always chosen mealtimes\u2014especially with  company present\u2014to describe everything and anything that had happened  to him during the day. And Edith herself had always chatted, especially  with his mother, though they didn't agree about much. Still, it had been  good-natured; the general tone of their lives had been good-natured.\n\n\n This wasn't good-natured. Exactly what it was he wasn't sure. \"Stiff\"  was perhaps the word.\n\n\n They began with grapefruit, Edith and Mother serving quickly,  efficiently from the kitchen, then sitting down at the table. He looked  at Mother as he raised his first spoonful of chilled fruit, and said,  \"Younger than ever.\" It was nothing new; he'd said it many many times  before, but his mother had always reacted with a bright smile and a quip  something like, \"Young for the Golden Age Center, you mean.\" This time  she burst into tears. It shocked him. But what shocked him even more was  the fact that no one looked up, commented, made any attempt to comfort  her; no one indicated in any way that a woman was sobbing at the table.\n\n\n He was sitting directly across from Mother, and reached out and touched  her left hand which lay limply beside the silverware. She didn't move  it\u2014she hadn't touched him once beyond that first, quick, strangely-cool  embrace at the door\u2014then a few seconds later she withdrew it and let it  drop out of sight.\n\n\n So there he was, Henry Devers, at home with the family. So there he was,  the hero returned, waiting to be treated as a human being.\n\n\n The grapefruit shells were cleaned away and the soup served. Uncle Joe  began to talk. \"The greatest little development of circular uniform  houses you ever did see,\" he boomed in his powerful salesman's voice.  \"Still going like sixty. We'll sell out before\u2014\" At that point he  looked at Hank, and Hank nodded encouragement, desperately interested in  this normalcy, and Joe's voice died away. He looked down at his plate,  mumbled, \"Soup's getting cold,\" and began to eat. His hand shook a  little; his ruddy face was not quite as ruddy as Hank remembered it.\n\n\n Aunt Lucille made a few quavering statements about the Ladies' Tuesday  Garden Club, and Hank looked across the table to where she sat between  Joe and Mother\u2014his wife and son bracketed him, and yet he felt  alone\u2014and said, \"I've missed fooling around with the lawn and the rose  bushes. Here it is August and I haven't had my hand to a mower or  trowel.\"\n\n\n Aunt Lucille smiled, if you could call it that\u2014a pitiful twitching of  the lips\u2014and nodded. She threw her eyes in his direction, and past him,  and then down to her plate. Mother, who was still sniffling, said, \"I  have a dismal headache. I'm going to lie down in the guest room a  while.\" She touched his shoulder in passing\u2014his affectionate, effusive  mother who would kiss stray dogs and strange children, who had often  irritated him with an excess of physical and verbal caresses\u2014she barely  touched his shoulder and fled.\n\n\n So now five of them sat at the table. The meat was served\u2014thin, rare  slices of beef, the pink blood-juice oozing warmly from the center. He  cut into it and raised a forkful to his mouth, then glanced at Ralphie  and said, \"Looks fresh enough to have been killed in the back yard.\"  Ralphie said, \"Yeah, Dad.\" Aunt Lucille put down her knife and fork and  murmured something to her husband. Joe cleared his throat and said  Lucille was rapidly becoming a vegetarian and he guessed she was going  into the living room for a while. \"She'll be back for dessert, of  course,\" he said, his laugh sounding forced.\n\n\n Hank looked at Edith; Edith was busy with her plate. Hank looked at  Ralphie; Ralphie was busy with his plate. Hank looked at Joe; Joe was  chewing, gazing out over their heads to the kitchen. Hank looked at  Lucille; she was disappearing into the living room.\n\n\n He brought his fist down on the table. The settings jumped; a glass  overturned, spilling water. He brought it down again and again. They  were all standing now. He sat there and pounded the table with his big  right fist\u2014Henry Devers, who would never have thought of making such a  scene before, but who was now so sick and tired of being treated as the  First One, of being stood back from, looked at in awe of, felt in fear  of, that he could have smashed more than a table.\n\n\n Edith said, \"Hank!\"\n\n\n He said, voice hoarse, \"Shut up. Go away. Let me eat alone. I'm sick of  the lot of you.\" Mother and Joe returned a few minutes later where he sat forcing food  down his throat. Mother said, \"Henry dear\u2014\" He didn't answer. She began  to cry, and he was glad she left the house then. He had never said  anything really bad to his mother. He was afraid this would have been  the time. Joe merely cleared his throat and mumbled something about  getting together again soon and \"drop out and see the new development\"  and he, too, was gone. Lucille never did manage to speak to him.\n\n\n He finished his beef and waited. Soon Edith came in with the special  dessert she'd been preparing half the day\u2014a magnificent English trifle.  She served him, and spooned out a portion for herself and Ralphie. She  hesitated near his chair, and when he made no comment she called the  boy. Then the three of them were sitting, facing the empty side of the  table. They ate the trifle. Ralphie finished first and got up and said,  \"Hey, I promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You promised the boys you'd play baseball or football or handball or  something; anything to get away from your father.\"\n\n\n Ralphie's head dropped and he muttered, \"Aw, no, Dad.\"\n\n\n Edith said, \"He'll stay home, Hank. We'll spend an evening  together\u2014talking, watching TV, playing Monopoly.\"\n\n\n Ralphie said, \"Gee, sure, Dad, if you want to.\"\n\n\n Hank stood up. \"The question is not whether I want to. You both know I  want to. The question is whether you want to.\"\n\n\n They answered together that of course they wanted to. But their  eyes\u2014his wife's and son's eyes\u2014could not meet his, and so he said he  was going to his room because he was, after all, very tired and would in  all probability continue to be very tired for a long, long time and that  they shouldn't count on him for normal social life.\n\n\n He fell asleep quickly, lying there in his clothes.\n\n\n But he didn't sleep long. Edith shook him and he opened his eyes to a  lighted room. \"Phil and Rhona are here.\" He blinked at her. She smiled,  and it seemed her old smile. \"They're so anxious to see you, Hank. I  could barely keep Phil from coming up and waking you himself. They want  to go out and do the town. Please, Hank, say you will.\"\n\n\n He sat up. \"Phil,\" he muttered. \"Phil and Rhona.\" They'd had wonderful  times together, from grammar school on. Phil and Rhona, their oldest and  closest friends. Perhaps this would begin his real homecoming.\n\n\n Do the town? They'd paint it and then tear it down! It didn't turn out that way. He was disappointed; but then again, he'd  also expected it. This entire first day at home had conditioned him to  expect nothing good. They went to the bowling alleys, and Phil sounded  very much the way he always had\u2014soft spoken and full of laughter and  full of jokes. He patted Edith on the head the way he always had, and  clapped Hank on the shoulder (but not the way he always had\u2014so much  more gently, almost remotely), and insisted they all drink more than was  good for them as he always had. And for once, Hank was ready to go along  on the drinking. For once, he matched Phil shot for shot, beer for beer.\n\n\n They didn't bowl very long. At ten o'clock they crossed the road to  Manfred's Tavern, where Phil and the girls ordered sandwiches and coffee  and Hank went right on drinking. Edith said something to him, but he  merely smiled and waved his hand and gulped another ounce of nirvana.\n\n\n There was dancing to a juke box in Manfred's Tavern. He'd been there  many times before, and he was sure several of the couples recognized  him. But except for a few abortive glances in his direction, it was as  if he were a stranger in a city halfway around the world.\n\n\n At midnight, he was still drinking. The others wanted to leave, but he  said, \"I haven't danced with my girl Rhona.\" His tongue was thick, his  mind was blurred, and yet he could read the strange expression on her  face\u2014pretty Rhona, who'd always flirted with him, who'd made a ritual  of flirting with him. Pretty Rhona, who now looked as if she were going  to be sick.\n\n\n \"So let's rock,\" he said and stood up.\n\n\n They were on the dance floor. He held her close, and hummed and chatted.  And through the alcoholic haze saw she was a stiff-smiled, stiff-bodied,  mechanical dancing doll.\n\n\n The number finished; they walked back to the booth. Phil said,  \"Beddy-bye time.\"\n\n\n Hank said, \"First one dance with my loving wife.\"\n\n\n He and Edith danced. He didn't hold her close as he had Rhona. He waited  for her to come close on her own, and she did, and yet she didn't.  Because while she put herself against him, there was something in her  face\u2014no, in her eyes; it always showed in the eyes\u2014that made him know  she was trying to be the old Edith and not succeeding. This time when  the music ended, he was ready to go home.\n\n\n They rode back to town along Route Nine, he and Edith in the rear of  Phil's car, Rhona driving because Phil had drunk just a little too much,  Phil singing and telling an occasional bad joke, and somehow not his old  self. No one was his old self. No one would ever be his old self with  the First One.\n\n\n They turned left, to take the short cut along Hallowed Hill Road, and  Phil finished a story about a Martian and a Hollywood sex queen and  looked at his wife and then past her at the long, cast-iron fence  paralleling the road. \"Hey,\" he said, pointing, \"do you know why that's  the most popular place on earth?\"\n\n\n Rhona glanced to the left, and so did Hank and Edith. Rhona made a  little sound, and Edith seemed to stop breathing, but Phil went on a  while longer, not yet aware of his supposed faux pas .\n\n\n \"You know why?\" he repeated, turning to the back seat, the laughter  rumbling up from his chest. \"You know why, folks?\"\n\n\n Rhona said, \"Did you notice Carl Braken and his wife at\u2014\"\n\n\n Hank said, \"No, Phil, why is it the most popular place on earth?\"\n\n\n Phil said, \"Because people are\u2014\" And then he caught himself and waved  his hand and muttered, \"I forgot the punch line.\"\n\n\n \"Because people are dying to get in,\" Hank said, and looked through the  window, past the iron fence, into the large cemetery at the fleeting  tombstones.\n\n\n The car was filled with horrified silence when there should have been  nothing but laughter, or irritation at a too-old joke. \"Maybe you should  let me out right here,\" Hank said. \"I'm home\u2014or that's what everyone  seems to think. Maybe I should lie down in an open grave. Maybe that  would satisfy people. Maybe that's the only way to act, like Dracula or  another monster from the movies.\"\n\n\n Edith said, \"Oh, Hank, don't, don't!\"\n\n\n The car raced along the road, crossed a macadam highway, went four  blocks and pulled to a stop. He didn't bother saying good night. He  didn't wait for Edith. He just got out and walked up the flagstone path  and entered the house. \"Hank,\" Edith whispered from the guest room doorway, \"I'm so sorry\u2014\"\n\n\n \"There's nothing to be sorry about. It's just a matter of time. It'll  all work out in time.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said quickly, \"that's it. I need a little time. We all need a  little time. Because it's so strange, Hank. Because it's so frightening.  I should have told you that the moment you walked in. I think I've hurt  you terribly, we've all hurt you terribly, by trying to hide that we're  frightened.\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to stay in the guest room,\" he said, \"for as long as  necessary. For good if need be.\"\n\n\n \"How could it be for good? How, Hank?\"\n\n\n That question was perhaps the first firm basis for hope he'd had since  returning. And there was something else; what Carlisle had told him,  even as Carlisle himself had reacted as all men did.\n\n\n \"There are others coming, Edith. Eight that I know of in the tanks right  now. My superior, Captain Davidson, who died at the same moment I  did\u2014seven months ago next Wednesday\u2014he's going to be next. He was  smashed up worse than I was, so it took a little longer, but he's almost  ready. And there'll be many more, Edith. The government is going to save  all they possibly can from now on. Every time a young and healthy man  loses his life by accident, by violence, and his body can be recovered,  he'll go into the tanks and they'll start the regenerative brain and  organ process\u2014the process that made it all possible. So people have to  get used to us. And the old stories, the old terrors, the ugly old  superstitions have to die, because in time each place will have some of  us; because in time it'll be an ordinary thing.\"\n\n\n Edith said, \"Yes, and I'm so grateful that you're here, Hank. Please  believe that. Please be patient with me and Ralphie and\u2014\" She paused.  \"There's one question.\"\n\n\n He knew what the question was.

KASTLE Illustrated by von Dongen [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Analog July 1961.  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright  on this publication was renewed.] The first man to return from beyond the Great Frontier may be  welcomed ... but will it be as a curiosity, rather than as a  hero...? There was the usual welcoming crowd for a celebrity, and the usual  speeches by the usual politicians who met him at the airport which had  once been twenty miles outside of Croton, but which the growing city had  since engulfed and placed well within its boundaries. But everything  wasn't usual. The crowd was quiet, and the mayor didn't seem quite as  at-ease as he'd been on his last big welcoming\u2014for Corporal Berringer,  one of the crew of the spaceship Washington , first to set Americans  upon Mars. His Honor's handclasp was somewhat moist and cold. His  Honor's eyes held a trace of remoteness.\n\n\n Still, he was the honored home-comer, the successful returnee, the  hometown boy who had made good in a big way, and they took the triumphal  tour up Main Street to the new square and the grandstand. There he sat  between the mayor and a nervous young coed chosen as homecoming queen,  and looked out at the police and fire department bands, the National  Guard, the boy scouts and girl scouts, the Elks and Masons. Several of  the churches in town had shown indecision as to how to instruct their  parishioners to treat him. But they had all come around. The tremendous  national interest, the fact that he was the First One, had made them  come around. It was obvious by now that they would have to adjust as  they'd adjusted to all the other firsts taking place in these\u2014as the  newspapers had dubbed the start of the Twenty-first Century\u2014the  Galloping Twenties.\n\n\n He was glad when the official greeting was over. He was a very tired man  and he had come farther, traveled longer and over darker country, than  any man who'd ever lived before. He wanted a meal at his own table, a  kiss from his wife, a word from his son, and later to see some old  friends and a relative or two. He didn't want to talk about the journey.  He wanted to forget the immediacy, the urgency, the terror; then perhaps  he would talk.\n\n\n Or would he? For he had very little to tell. He had traveled and he had  returned and his voyage was very much like the voyages of the great  mariners, from Columbus onward\u2014long, dull periods of time passing,  passing, and then the arrival.\n\n\n The house had changed. He saw that as soon as the official car let him  off at 45 Roosevelt Street. The change was, he knew, for the better.  They had put a porch in front. They had rehabilitated, spruced up,  almost rebuilt the entire outside and grounds. But he was sorry. He had  wanted it to be as before.\n\n\n The head of the American Legion and the chief of police, who had  escorted him on this trip from the square, didn't ask to go in with him.  He was glad. He'd had enough of strangers. Not that he was through with  strangers. There were dozens of them up and down the street, standing  beside parked cars, looking at him. But when he looked back at them,  their eyes dropped, they turned away, they began moving off. He was  still too much the First One to have his gaze met.\n\n\n He walked up what had once been a concrete path and was now an ornate  flagstone path. He climbed the new porch and raised the ornamental  knocker on the new door and heard the soft music sound within. He was  surprised that he'd had to do this. He'd thought Edith would be watching  at a window.\n\n\n And perhaps she had been watching ... but she hadn't opened the door.\n\n\n The door opened; he looked at her. It hadn't been too long and she  hadn't changed at all. She was still the small, slender girl he'd loved  in high school, the small, slender woman he'd married twelve years ago.  Ralphie was with her. They held onto each other as if seeking mutual  support, the thirty-three-year old woman and ten-year-old boy. They  looked at him, and then both moved forward, still together. He said,  \"It's good to be home!\"\n\n\n Edith nodded and, still holding to Ralphie with one hand, put the other  arm around him. He kissed her\u2014her neck, her cheek\u2014and all the old  jokes came to mind, the jokes of travel-weary, battle-weary men, the  and- then -I'll-put-my-pack-aside jokes that spoke of terrible hunger.  She was trembling, and even as her lips came up to touch his he felt the  difference, and because of this difference he turned with urgency to  Ralphie and picked him up and hugged him and said, because he could  think of nothing else to say, \"What a big fella, what a big fella.\"\n\n\n Ralphie stood in his arms as if his feet were still planted on the  floor, and he didn't look at his father but somewhere beyond him. \"I  didn't grow much while you were gone, Dad, Mom says I don't eat enough.\"\n\n\n So he put him down and told himself that it would all change, that  everything would loosen up just as his commanding officer, General  Carlisle, had said it would early this morning before he left  Washington.\n\n\n \"Give it some time,\" Carlisle had said. \"You need the time; they need  the time. And for the love of heaven, don't be sensitive.\" Edith was leading him into the living room, her hand lying still in his,  a cool, dead bird lying still in his. He sat down on the couch, she sat  down beside him\u2014but she had hesitated. He wasn't being sensitive; she  had hesitated. His wife had hesitated before sitting down beside him.\n\n\n Carlisle had said his position was analogous to Columbus', to Vasco De  Gama's, to Preshoff's when the Russian returned from the Moon\u2014but more  so. Carlisle had said lots of things, but even Carlisle who had worked  with him all the way, who had engineered the entire fantastic  journey\u2014even Carlisle the Nobel prize winner, the multi-degreed genius  in uniform, had not actually spoken to him as one man to another. The eyes. It always showed in their eyes. He looked across the room at Ralphie, standing in the doorway, a boy  already tall, already widening in the shoulders, already large of  feature. It was like looking into the mirror and seeing himself  twenty-five years ago. But Ralphie's face was drawn, was worried in a  way that few ten-year-old faces are.\n\n\n \"How's it going in school?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"Gee, Dad, it's the second month of summer vacation.\"\n\n\n \"Well, then, before summer vacation?\"\n\n\n \"Pretty good.\"\n\n\n Edith said, \"He made top forum the six-month period before vacation, and  he made top forum the six-month period you went away, Hank.\"\n\n\n He nodded, remembering that, remembering everything, remembering the  warmth of her farewell, the warmth of Ralphie's farewell, their tears as  he left for the experimental flight station in the Aleutians. They had  feared for him, having read of the many launchings gone wrong even in  continent-to-continent experimental flight.\n\n\n They had been right to worry. He had suffered much after that blow-up.  But now they should be rejoicing, because he had survived and made the  long journey. Ralphie suddenly said, \"I got to go, Dad. I promised Walt  and the others I'd pitch. It's Inter-Town Little League, you know. It's  Harmon, you know. I got to keep my word.\" Without waiting for an answer,  he waved his hand\u2014it shook; a ten-year-old boy's hand that shook\u2014and  ran from the room and from the house.\n\n\n He and Edith sat beside each other, and he wanted badly to take her in  his arms, and yet he didn't want to oppress her. He stood up. \"I'm very  tired. I'd like to lie down a while.\" Which wasn't true, because he'd  been lying down all the months of the way back.\n\n\n She said, \"Of course. How stupid of me, expecting you to sit around and  make small talk and pick up just where you left off.\"\n\n\n He nodded. But that was exactly what he wanted to do\u2014make small talk  and pick up just where he'd left off. But they didn't expect it of him;  they wouldn't let him; they felt he had changed too much. She led him upstairs and along the foyer past Ralphie's room and past  the small guest room to their bedroom. This, too, had changed. It was  newly painted and it had new furniture. He saw twin beds separated by an  ornate little table with an ornate little lamp, and this looked more  ominous a barrier to him than the twelve-foot concrete-and-barbed-wire  fence around the experimental station.\n\n\n \"Which one is mine,\" he asked, and tried to smile.\n\n\n She also tried to smile. \"The one near the window. You always liked the  fresh air, the sunshine in the morning. You always said it helped you  to get up on time when you were stationed at the base outside of town.  You always said it reminded you\u2014being able to see the sky\u2014that you  were going to go up in it, and that you were going to come down from it  to this bed again.\"\n\n\n \"Not this bed,\" he murmured, and was a little sorry afterward.\n\n\n \"No, not this bed,\" she said quickly. \"Your lodge donated the bedroom  set and I really didn't know\u2014\" She waved her hand, her face white.\n\n\n He was sure then that she had known, and that the beds and the barrier  between them were her own choice, if only an unconscious choice. He went  to the bed near the window, stripped off his Air Force blue jacket,  began to take off his shirt, but then remembered that some arm scars  still showed. He waited for her to leave the room.\n\n\n She said, \"Well then, rest up, dear,\" and went out.\n\n\n He took off his shirt and saw himself in the mirror on the opposite  wall; and then took off his under-shirt. The body scars were faint, the  scars running in long lines, one dissecting his chest, the other slicing  diagonally across his upper abdomen to disappear under his trousers.  There were several more on his back, and one on his right thigh. They'd  been treated properly and would soon disappear. But she had never seen  them.\n\n\n Perhaps she never would. Perhaps pajamas and robes and dark rooms would  keep them from her until they were gone.\n\n\n Which was not what he'd considered at all important on leaving Walter  Reed Hospital early this morning; which was something he found  distasteful, something he felt beneath them both. And, at the same time,  he began to understand that there would be many things, previously  beneath them both, which would have to be considered. She had changed;  Ralphie had changed; all the people he knew had probably  changed\u2014because they thought he had changed.\n\n\n He was tired of thinking. He lay down and closed his eyes. He let  himself taste bitterness, unhappiness, a loneliness he had never known  before.\n\n\n But sometime later, as he was dozing off, a sense of reassurance began  filtering into his mind. After all, he was still Henry Devers, the same  man who had left home eleven months ago, with a love for family and  friends which was, if anything, stronger than before. Once he could  communicate this, the strangeness would disappear and the First One  would again become good old Hank. It was little enough to ask for\u2014a  return to old values, old relationships, the normalcies of the backwash  instead of the freneticisms of the lime-light. It would certainly be  granted to him.\n\n\n He slept. Dinner was at seven  p.m.  His mother came; his Uncle Joe and Aunt Lucille  came. Together with Edith, Ralphie and himself, they made six, and ate  in the dining room at the big table.\n\n\n Before he'd become the First One, it would have been a noisy affair. His  family had never been noted for a lack of ebullience, a lack of  talkativeness, and Ralphie had always chosen mealtimes\u2014especially with  company present\u2014to describe everything and anything that had happened  to him during the day. And Edith herself had always chatted, especially  with his mother, though they didn't agree about much. Still, it had been  good-natured; the general tone of their lives had been good-natured.\n\n\n This wasn't good-natured. Exactly what it was he wasn't sure. \"Stiff\"  was perhaps the word.\n\n\n They began with grapefruit, Edith and Mother serving quickly,  efficiently from the kitchen, then sitting down at the table. He looked  at Mother as he raised his first spoonful of chilled fruit, and said,  \"Younger than ever.\" It was nothing new; he'd said it many many times  before, but his mother had always reacted with a bright smile and a quip  something like, \"Young for the Golden Age Center, you mean.\" This time  she burst into tears. It shocked him. But what shocked him even more was  the fact that no one looked up, commented, made any attempt to comfort  her; no one indicated in any way that a woman was sobbing at the table.\n\n\n He was sitting directly across from Mother, and reached out and touched  her left hand which lay limply beside the silverware. She didn't move  it\u2014she hadn't touched him once beyond that first, quick, strangely-cool  embrace at the door\u2014then a few seconds later she withdrew it and let it  drop out of sight.\n\n\n So there he was, Henry Devers, at home with the family. So there he was,  the hero returned, waiting to be treated as a human being.\n\n\n The grapefruit shells were cleaned away and the soup served. Uncle Joe  began to talk. \"The greatest little development of circular uniform  houses you ever did see,\" he boomed in his powerful salesman's voice.  \"Still going like sixty. We'll sell out before\u2014\" At that point he  looked at Hank, and Hank nodded encouragement, desperately interested in  this normalcy, and Joe's voice died away. He looked down at his plate,  mumbled, \"Soup's getting cold,\" and began to eat. His hand shook a  little; his ruddy face was not quite as ruddy as Hank remembered it.\n\n\n Aunt Lucille made a few quavering statements about the Ladies' Tuesday  Garden Club, and Hank looked across the table to where she sat between  Joe and Mother\u2014his wife and son bracketed him, and yet he felt  alone\u2014and said, \"I've missed fooling around with the lawn and the rose  bushes. Here it is August and I haven't had my hand to a mower or  trowel.\"\n\n\n Aunt Lucille smiled, if you could call it that\u2014a pitiful twitching of  the lips\u2014and nodded. She threw her eyes in his direction, and past him,  and then down to her plate. Mother, who was still sniffling, said, \"I  have a dismal headache. I'm going to lie down in the guest room a  while.\" She touched his shoulder in passing\u2014his affectionate, effusive  mother who would kiss stray dogs and strange children, who had often  irritated him with an excess of physical and verbal caresses\u2014she barely  touched his shoulder and fled.\n\n\n So now five of them sat at the table. The meat was served\u2014thin, rare  slices of beef, the pink blood-juice oozing warmly from the center. He  cut into it and raised a forkful to his mouth, then glanced at Ralphie  and said, \"Looks fresh enough to have been killed in the back yard.\"  Ralphie said, \"Yeah, Dad.\" Aunt Lucille put down her knife and fork and  murmured something to her husband. Joe cleared his throat and said  Lucille was rapidly becoming a vegetarian and he guessed she was going  into the living room for a while. \"She'll be back for dessert, of  course,\" he said, his laugh sounding forced.\n\n\n Hank looked at Edith; Edith was busy with her plate. Hank looked at  Ralphie; Ralphie was busy with his plate. Hank looked at Joe; Joe was  chewing, gazing out over their heads to the kitchen. Hank looked at  Lucille; she was disappearing into the living room.\n\n\n He brought his fist down on the table. The settings jumped; a glass  overturned, spilling water. He brought it down again and again. They  were all standing now. He sat there and pounded the table with his big  right fist\u2014Henry Devers, who would never have thought of making such a  scene before, but who was now so sick and tired of being treated as the  First One, of being stood back from, looked at in awe of, felt in fear  of, that he could have smashed more than a table.\n\n\n Edith said, \"Hank!\"\n\n\n He said, voice hoarse, \"Shut up. Go away. Let me eat alone. I'm sick of  the lot of you.\" Mother and Joe returned a few minutes later where he sat forcing food  down his throat. Mother said, \"Henry dear\u2014\" He didn't answer. She began  to cry, and he was glad she left the house then. He had never said  anything really bad to his mother. He was afraid this would have been  the time. Joe merely cleared his throat and mumbled something about  getting together again soon and \"drop out and see the new development\"  and he, too, was gone. Lucille never did manage to speak to him.\n\n\n He finished his beef and waited. Soon Edith came in with the special  dessert she'd been preparing half the day\u2014a magnificent English trifle.  She served him, and spooned out a portion for herself and Ralphie. She  hesitated near his chair, and when he made no comment she called the  boy. Then the three of them were sitting, facing the empty side of the  table. They ate the trifle. Ralphie finished first and got up and said,  \"Hey, I promised\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You promised the boys you'd play baseball or football or handball or  something; anything to get away from your father.\"\n\n\n Ralphie's head dropped and he muttered, \"Aw, no, Dad.\"\n\n\n Edith said, \"He'll stay home, Hank. We'll spend an evening  together\u2014talking, watching TV, playing Monopoly.\"\n\n\n Ralphie said, \"Gee, sure, Dad, if you want to.\"\n\n\n Hank stood up. \"The question is not whether I want to. You both know I  want to. The question is whether you want to.\"\n\n\n They answered together that of course they wanted to. But their  eyes\u2014his wife's and son's eyes\u2014could not meet his, and so he said he  was going to his room because he was, after all, very tired and would in  all probability continue to be very tired for a long, long time and that  they shouldn't count on him for normal social life.\n\n\n He fell asleep quickly, lying there in his clothes.\n\n\n But he didn't sleep long. Edith shook him and he opened his eyes to a  lighted room. \"Phil and Rhona are here.\" He blinked at her. She smiled,  and it seemed her old smile. \"They're so anxious to see you, Hank. I  could barely keep Phil from coming up and waking you himself. They want  to go out and do the town. Please, Hank, say you will.\"\n\n\n He sat up. \"Phil,\" he muttered. \"Phil and Rhona.\" They'd had wonderful  times together, from grammar school on. Phil and Rhona, their oldest and  closest friends. Perhaps this would begin his real homecoming.\n\n\n Do the town? They'd paint it and then tear it down! It didn't turn out that way. He was disappointed; but then again, he'd  also expected it. This entire first day at home had conditioned him to  expect nothing good. They went to the bowling alleys, and Phil sounded  very much the way he always had\u2014soft spoken and full of laughter and  full of jokes. He patted Edith on the head the way he always had, and  clapped Hank on the shoulder (but not the way he always had\u2014so much  more gently, almost remotely), and insisted they all drink more than was  good for them as he always had. And for once, Hank was ready to go along  on the drinking. For once, he matched Phil shot for shot, beer for beer.\n\n\n They didn't bowl very long. At ten o'clock they crossed the road to  Manfred's Tavern, where Phil and the girls ordered sandwiches and coffee  and Hank went right on drinking. Edith said something to him, but he  merely smiled and waved his hand and gulped another ounce of nirvana.\n\n\n There was dancing to a juke box in Manfred's Tavern. He'd been there  many times before, and he was sure several of the couples recognized  him. But except for a few abortive glances in his direction, it was as  if he were a stranger in a city halfway around the world.\n\n\n At midnight, he was still drinking. The others wanted to leave, but he  said, \"I haven't danced with my girl Rhona.\" His tongue was thick, his  mind was blurred, and yet he could read the strange expression on her  face\u2014pretty Rhona, who'd always flirted with him, who'd made a ritual  of flirting with him. Pretty Rhona, who now looked as if she were going  to be sick.\n\n\n \"So let's rock,\" he said and stood up.\n\n\n They were on the dance floor. He held her close, and hummed and chatted.  And through the alcoholic haze saw she was a stiff-smiled, stiff-bodied,  mechanical dancing doll.\n\n\n The number finished; they walked back to the booth. Phil said,  \"Beddy-bye time.\"\n\n\n Hank said, \"First one dance with my loving wife.\"\n\n\n He and Edith danced. He didn't hold her close as he had Rhona. He waited  for her to come close on her own, and she did, and yet she didn't.  Because while she put herself against him, there was something in her  face\u2014no, in her eyes; it always showed in the eyes\u2014that made him know  she was trying to be the old Edith and not succeeding. This time when  the music ended, he was ready to go home.\n\n\n They rode back to town along Route Nine, he and Edith in the rear of  Phil's car, Rhona driving because Phil had drunk just a little too much,  Phil singing and telling an occasional bad joke, and somehow not his old  self. No one was his old self. No one would ever be his old self with  the First One.\n\n\n They turned left, to take the short cut along Hallowed Hill Road, and  Phil finished a story about a Martian and a Hollywood sex queen and  looked at his wife and then past her at the long, cast-iron fence  paralleling the road. \"Hey,\" he said, pointing, \"do you know why that's  the most popular place on earth?\"\n\n\n Rhona glanced to the left, and so did Hank and Edith. Rhona made a  little sound, and Edith seemed to stop breathing, but Phil went on a  while longer, not yet aware of his supposed faux pas .\n\n\n \"You know why?\" he repeated, turning to the back seat, the laughter  rumbling up from his chest. \"You know why, folks?\"\n\n\n Rhona said, \"Did you notice Carl Braken and his wife at\u2014\"\n\n\n Hank said, \"No, Phil, why is it the most popular place on earth?\"\n\n\n Phil said, \"Because people are\u2014\" And then he caught himself and waved  his hand and muttered, \"I forgot the punch line.\"\n\n\n \"Because people are dying to get in,\" Hank said, and looked through the  window, past the iron fence, into the large cemetery at the fleeting  tombstones.\n\n\n The car was filled with horrified silence when there should have been  nothing but laughter, or irritation at a too-old joke. \"Maybe you should  let me out right here,\" Hank said. \"I'm home\u2014or that's what everyone  seems to think. Maybe I should lie down in an open grave. Maybe that  would satisfy people. Maybe that's the only way to act, like Dracula or  another monster from the movies.\"\n\n\n Edith said, \"Oh, Hank, don't, don't!\"\n\n\n The car raced along the road, crossed a macadam highway, went four  blocks and pulled to a stop. He didn't bother saying good night. He  didn't wait for Edith. He just got out and walked up the flagstone path  and entered the house. \"Hank,\" Edith whispered from the guest room doorway, \"I'm so sorry\u2014\"\n\n\n \"There's nothing to be sorry about. It's just a matter of time. It'll  all work out in time.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" she said quickly, \"that's it. I need a little time. We all need a  little time. Because it's so strange, Hank. Because it's so frightening.  I should have told you that the moment you walked in. I think I've hurt  you terribly, we've all hurt you terribly, by trying to hide that we're  frightened.\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to stay in the guest room,\" he said, \"for as long as  necessary. For good if need be.\"\n\n\n \"How could it be for good? How, Hank?\"\n\n\n That question was perhaps the first firm basis for hope he'd had since  returning. And there was something else; what Carlisle had told him,  even as Carlisle himself had reacted as all men did.\n\n\n \"There are others coming, Edith. Eight that I know of in the tanks right  now. My superior, Captain Davidson, who died at the same moment I  did\u2014seven months ago next Wednesday\u2014he's going to be next. He was  smashed up worse than I was, so it took a little longer, but he's almost  ready. And there'll be many more, Edith. The government is going to save  all they possibly can from now on. Every time a young and healthy man  loses his life by accident, by violence, and his body can be recovered,  he'll go into the tanks and they'll start the regenerative brain and  organ process\u2014the process that made it all possible. So people have to  get used to us. And the old stories, the old terrors, the ugly old  superstitions have to die, because in time each place will have some of  us; because in time it'll be an ordinary thing.\"\n\n\n Edith said, \"Yes, and I'm so grateful that you're here, Hank. Please  believe that. Please be patient with me and Ralphie and\u2014\" She paused.  \"There's one question.\"\n\n\n He knew what the question was. It had been the first asked him by  everyone from the president of the United States on down.\n\n\n \"I saw nothing,\" he said. \"It was as if I slept those six and a half  months\u2014slept without dreaming.\"\n\n\n She came to him and touched his face with her lips, and he was  satisfied.\n\n\n Later, half asleep, he heard a dog howling, and remembered stories of  how they announced death and the presence of monsters. He shivered and  pulled the covers closer to him and luxuriated in being safe in his own  home.
