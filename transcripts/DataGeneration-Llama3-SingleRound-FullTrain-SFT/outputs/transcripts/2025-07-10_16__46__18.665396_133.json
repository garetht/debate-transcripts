FONTENAY He was a living weapon of\n\n destruction\u2014  immeasurably\n\n powerful, utterly invulnerable.\n\n There was only one\n\n question: Was he human? Trella  feared she was in  for trouble even before Motwick's  head dropped forward on  his arms in a drunken stupor.  The two evil-looking men at the  table nearby had been watching  her surreptitiously, and now  they shifted restlessly in their  chairs.\n\n\n Trella had not wanted to come  to the Golden Satellite. It was a  squalid saloon in the rougher  section of Jupiter's View, the  terrestrial dome-colony on Ganymede.  Motwick,  already  drunk,  had insisted.\n\n\n A woman could not possibly  make her way through these  streets alone to the better section  of town, especially one clad  in a silvery evening dress. Her  only hope was that this place  had a telephone. Perhaps she  could call one of Motwick's  friends; she had no one on Ganymede  she could call a real friend  herself.\n\n\n Tentatively, she pushed her  chair back from the table and  arose. She had to brush close by  the other table to get to the bar.  As she did, the dark, slick-haired  man reached out and grabbed  her around the waist with a  steely arm.\n\n\n Trella swung with her whole  body, and slapped him so hard  he nearly fell from his chair. As  she walked swiftly toward the  bar, he leaped up to follow her.\n\n\n There were only two other  people in the Golden Satellite:  the fat, mustached bartender  and a short, square-built man at  the bar. The latter swung  around at the pistol-like report  of her slap, and she saw that,  though no more than four and a  half feet tall, he was as heavily  muscled as a lion.\n\n\n 51  His face was clean and open,  with close-cropped blond hair  and honest blue eyes. She ran to  him.\n\n\n \u201cHelp me!\u201d she cried. \u201cPlease  help me!\u201d\n\n\n He began to back away from  her.\n\n\n \u201cI can't,\u201d he muttered in a  deep voice. \u201cI can't help you. I  can't do anything.\u201d The dark man was at her  heels. In desperation, she dodged  around the short man and took  refuge behind him. Her protector  was obviously unwilling, but  the dark man, faced with his  massiveness, took no chances.  He stopped and shouted:\n\n\n \u201cKregg!\u201d\n\n\n The other man at the table  arose, ponderously, and lumbered  toward them. He was immense,  at least six and a half  feet tall, with a brutal, vacant  face.\n\n\n Evading her attempts to stay  behind him, the squat man began  to move down the bar away  from the approaching Kregg.  The dark man moved in on  Trella again as Kregg overtook  his quarry and swung a huge  fist like a sledgehammer.\n\n\n Exactly what happened, Trella  wasn't sure. She had the impression  that Kregg's fist connected  squarely with the short man's  chin  before  he dodged to one  side in a movement so fast it  was a blur. But that couldn't  have been, because the short  man wasn't moved by that blow  that would have felled a steer,  and Kregg roared in pain, grabbing  his injured fist.\n\n\n \u201cThe bar!\u201d yelled Kregg. \u201cI  hit the damn bar!\u201d\n\n\n At this juncture, the bartender  took a hand. Leaning far  over the bar, he swung a full  bottle in a complete arc. It  smashed on Kregg's head,  splashing the floor with liquor,  and Kregg sank stunned to his  knees. The dark man, who had  grabbed Trella's arm, released  her and ran for the door.\n\n\n Moving agilely around the end  of the bar, the bartender stood  over Kregg, holding the jagged-edged  bottleneck in his hand  menacingly.\n\n\n \u201cGet out!\u201d rumbled the bartender.  \u201cI'll have no coppers  raiding my place for the likes of  you!\u201d\n\n\n Kregg stumbled to his feet  and staggered out. Trella ran to  the unconscious Motwick's side.\n\n\n \u201cThat means you, too, lady,\u201d  said the bartender beside her.  \u201cYou and your boy friend get  out of here. You oughtn't to  have come here in the first  place.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMay I help you, Miss?\u201d asked  a deep, resonant voice behind  her.\n\n\n She straightened from her  anxious examination of Motwick.  The squat man was standing  there, an apologetic look on  his face.\n\n\n She looked contemptuously at  the massive muscles whose help  had been denied her. Her arm  ached where the dark man had  grasped it. The broad face before  52  her was not unhandsome,  and the blue eyes were disconcertingly  direct, but she despised  him for a coward.\n\n\n \u201cI'm sorry I couldn't fight  those men for you, Miss, but I  just couldn't,\u201d he said miserably,  as though reading her thoughts.  \u201cBut no one will bother you on  the street if I'm with you.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cA lot of protection you'd be  if they did!\u201d she snapped. \u201cBut  I'm desperate. You can carry  him to the Stellar Hotel for me.\u201d The gravity of Ganymede was  hardly more than that of Earth's  moon, but the way the man  picked up the limp Motwick with  one hand and tossed him over a  shoulder was startling: as  though he lifted a feather pillow.  He followed Trella out the door  of the Golden Satellite and fell  in step beside her. Immediately  she was grateful for his presence.  The dimly lighted street  was not crowded, but she didn't  like the looks of the men she  saw.\n\n\n The transparent dome of Jupiter's  View was faintly visible  in the reflected night lights of  the colonial city, but the lights  were overwhelmed by the giant,  vari-colored disc of Jupiter itself,  riding high in the sky.\n\n\n \u201cI'm Quest Mansard, Miss,\u201d  said her companion. \u201cI'm just in  from Jupiter.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI'm Trella Nuspar,\u201d she said,  favoring him with a green-eyed  glance. \u201cYou mean Io, don't you\u2014or  Moon Five?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo,\u201d he said, grinning at  her. He had an engaging grin,  with even white teeth. \u201cI meant  Jupiter.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou're lying,\u201d she said flatly.  \u201cNo one has ever landed on  Jupiter. It would be impossible  to blast off again.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMy parents landed on Jupiter,  and I blasted off from it,\u201d  he said soberly. \u201cI was born  there. Have you ever heard of  Dr. Eriklund Mansard?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI certainly have,\u201d she said,  her interest taking a sudden  upward turn. \u201cHe developed the  surgiscope, didn't he? But his  ship was drawn into Jupiter and  lost.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt was drawn into Jupiter,  but he landed it successfully,\u201d  said Quest. \u201cHe and my mother  lived on Jupiter until the oxygen  equipment wore out at last. I  was born and brought up there,  and I was finally able to build  a small rocket with a powerful  enough drive to clear the  planet.\u201d\n\n\n She looked at him. He was  short, half a head shorter than  she, but broad and powerful as  a man might be who had grown  up in heavy gravity. He trod the  street with a light, controlled  step, seeming to deliberately  hold himself down.\n\n\n \u201cIf Dr. Mansard succeeded in  landing on Jupiter, why didn't  anyone ever hear from him  again?\u201d she demanded.\n\n\n \u201cBecause,\u201d said Quest, \u201chis  radio was sabotaged, just as his  ship's drive was.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cJupiter strength,\u201d she murmured,  looking him over coolly.  53  \u201cYou wear Motwick on your  shoulder like a scarf. But you  couldn't bring yourself to help  a woman against two thugs.\u201d\n\n\n He flushed.\n\n\n \u201cI'm sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's  something I couldn't help.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don't know. It's not that  I'm afraid, but there's something  in me that makes me back  away from the prospect of fighting  anyone.\u201d\n\n\n Trella sighed. Cowardice was  a state of mind. It was peculiarly  inappropriate, but not unbelievable,  that the strongest and  most agile man on Ganymede  should be a coward. Well, she  thought with a rush of sympathy,  he couldn't help being  what he was. They had reached the more  brightly lighted section of the  city now. Trella could get a cab  from here, but the Stellar Hotel  wasn't far. They walked on.\n\n\n Trella had the desk clerk call  a cab to deliver the unconscious  Motwick to his home. She and  Quest had a late sandwich in the  coffee shop.\n\n\n \u201cI landed here only a week  ago,\u201d he told her, his eyes frankly  admiring her honey-colored  hair and comely face. \u201cI'm heading  for Earth on the next spaceship.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWe'll be traveling companions,  then,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm going  back on that ship, too.\u201d\n\n\n For some reason she decided  against telling him that the  assignment on which she had  come to the Jupiter system was  to gather his own father's notebooks  and take them back to  Earth. Motwick was an irresponsible  playboy whom Trella had known  briefly on Earth, and Trella was  glad to dispense with his company  for the remaining three  weeks before the spaceship  blasted off. She found herself  enjoying the steadier companionship  of Quest.\n\n\n As a matter of fact, she found  herself enjoying his companionship  more than she intended to.  She found herself falling in love  with him.\n\n\n Now this did not suit her at  all. Trella had always liked her  men tall and dark. She had determined  that when she married  it would be to a curly-haired six-footer.\n\n\n She was not at all happy about  being so strongly attracted to a  man several inches shorter than  she. She was particularly unhappy  about feeling drawn to a  man who was a coward.\n\n\n The ship that they boarded on  Moon Nine was one of the newer  ships that could attain a hundred-mile-per-second  velocity  and take a hyperbolic path to  Earth, but it would still require  fifty-four days to make the trip.  So Trella was delighted to find  that the ship was the Cometfire and its skipper was her old  friend, dark-eyed, curly-haired  Jakdane Gille.\n\n\n \u201cJakdane,\u201d she said, flirting  with him with her eyes as in  54  days gone by, \u201cI need a chaperon  this trip, and you're ideal for  the job.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI never thought of myself in  quite that light, but maybe  I'm getting old,\u201d he answered,  laughing. \u201cWhat's your trouble,  Trella?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI'm in love with that huge  chunk of man who came aboard  with me, and I'm not sure I  ought to be,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI  may need protection against myself  till we get to Earth.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIf it's to keep you out of another  fellow's clutches, I'm your  man,\u201d agreed Jakdane heartily.  \u201cI always had a mind to save  you for myself. I'll guarantee  you won't have a moment alone  with him the whole trip.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou don't have to be that  thorough about it,\u201d she protested  hastily. \u201cI want to get a little  enjoyment out of being in love.  But if I feel myself weakening  too much, I'll holler for help.\u201d\n\n\n The Cometfire swung around  great Jupiter in an opening arc  and plummeted ever more swiftly  toward the tight circles of the  inner planets. There were four  crew members and three passengers  aboard the ship's tiny personnel  sphere, and Trella was  thrown with Quest almost constantly.  She enjoyed every minute  of it.\n\n\n She told him only that she  was a messenger, sent out to  Ganymede to pick up some important  papers and take them  back to Earth. She was tempted  to tell him what the papers were.  Her employer had impressed upon  her that her mission was confidential,  but surely Dom  Blessing  could not object to Dr.  Mansard's son knowing about it.\n\n\n All these things had happened  before she was born, and she  did not know what Dom Blessing's  relation to Dr. Mansard  had been, but it must have been  very close. She knew that Dr.  Mansard had invented the surgiscope.\n\n\n This was an instrument with  a three-dimensional screen as its  heart. The screen was a cubical  frame in which an apparently  solid image was built up of an  object under an electron microscope. The actual cutting instrument  of the surgiscope was an ion  stream. By operating a tool in  the three-dimensional screen,  corresponding movements were  made by the ion stream on the  object under the microscope.  The  principle  was the same as  that used in operation of remote  control \u201chands\u201d in atomic laboratories  to handle hot material,  and with the surgiscope very  delicate operations could be performed  at the cellular level.\n\n\n Dr. Mansard and his wife had  disappeared into the turbulent  atmosphere of Jupiter just after  his invention of the surgiscope,  and it had been developed by  Dom Blessing. Its success had  built Spaceway Instruments, Incorporated,  which Blessing headed.\n\n\n Through all these years since  Dr. Mansard's disappearance,  55  Blessing had been searching the  Jovian moons for a second, hidden  laboratory of Dr. Mansard.  When it was found at last, he  sent Trella, his most trusted  secretary, to Ganymede to bring  back to him the notebooks found  there.\n\n\n Blessing would, of course, be  happy to learn that a son of Dr.  Mansard lived, and would see  that he received his rightful  share of the inheritance. Because  of this, Trella was tempted  to tell Quest the good news  herself; but she decided against  it. It was Blessing's privilege to  do this his own way, and he  might not appreciate her meddling. At midtrip, Trella made a rueful  confession to Jakdane.\n\n\n \u201cIt seems I was taking unnecessary  precautions when I asked  you to be a chaperon,\u201d she said.  \u201cI kept waiting for Quest to do  something, and when he didn't  I told him I loved him.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt's very peculiar,\u201d she said  unhappily. \u201cHe said he  can't  love me. He said he wants to  love me and he feels that he  should, but there's something in  him that refuses to permit it.\u201d\n\n\n She expected Jakdane to salve  her wounded feelings with a  sympathetic pleasantry, but he  did not. Instead, he just looked  at her very thoughtfully and  said no more about the matter.\n\n\n He explained his attitude  after Asrange ran amuck.\n\n\n Asrange was the third passenger.  He was a lean, saturnine  individual who said little and  kept to himself as much as possible.  He was distantly polite in  his relations with both crew and  other passengers, and never  showed the slightest spark of  emotion \u2026 until the day Quest  squirted coffee on him.\n\n\n It was one of those accidents  that can occur easily in space.  The passengers and the two  crewmen on that particular waking  shift (including Jakdane)  were eating lunch on the center-deck.  Quest picked up his bulb  of coffee, but inadvertently  pressed it before he got it to his  lips. The coffee squirted all over  the front of Asrange's clean  white tunic.\n\n\n \u201cI'm sorry!\u201d exclaimed Quest  in distress.\n\n\n The man's eyes went wide and  he snarled. So quickly it seemed  impossible, he had unbuckled  himself from his seat and hurled  himself backward from the table  with an incoherent cry. He  seized the first object his hand  touched\u2014it happened to be a  heavy wooden cane leaning  against Jakdane's bunk\u2014propelled  himself like a projectile at  Quest.\n\n\n Quest rose from the table in  a sudden uncoiling of movement.  He did not unbuckle his safety  belt\u2014he rose and it snapped like  a string.\n\n\n For a moment Trella thought  he was going to meet Asrange's  assault. But he fled in a long  leap toward the companionway  leading to the astrogation deck  56  above. Landing feet-first in the  middle of the table and rebounding,  Asrange pursued with the  stick upraised.\n\n\n In his haste, Quest missed the  companionway in his leap and  was cornered against one of the  bunks. Asrange descended on  him like an avenging angel and,  holding onto the bunk with one  hand, rained savage blows on his  head and shoulders with the  heavy stick.\n\n\n Quest made no effort to retaliate.  He cowered under the attack,  holding his hands in front  of him as if to ward it off. In a  moment, Jakdane and the other  crewman had reached Asrange  and pulled him off. When they had Asrange in  irons, Jakdane turned to Quest,  who was now sitting unhappily  at the table.\n\n\n \u201cTake it easy,\u201d he advised.  \u201cI'll wake the psychosurgeon  and have him look you over. Just  stay there.\u201d\n\n\n Quest shook his head.\n\n\n \u201cDon't bother him,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt's nothing but a few bruises.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBruises? Man, that club  could have broken your skull!  Or a couple of ribs, at the very  least.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI'm all right,\u201d insisted  Quest; and when the skeptical  Jakdane insisted on examining  him carefully, he had to admit  it. There was hardly a mark on  him from the blows.\n\n\n \u201cIf it didn't hurt you any  more than that, why didn't you  take that stick away from him?\u201d  demanded Jakdane. \u201cYou could  have, easily.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI couldn't,\u201d said Quest miserably,  and turned his face  away.\n\n\n Later, alone with Trella on  the control deck, Jakdane gave  her some sober advice.\n\n\n \u201cIf you think you're in love  with Quest, forget it,\u201d he said.\n\n\n \u201cWhy? Because he's a coward?  I know that ought to make  me despise him, but it doesn't  any more.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNot because he's a coward.  Because he's an android!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat? Jakdane, you can't be  serious!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI am. I say he's an android,  an artificial imitation of a man.  It all figures.\n\n\n \u201cLook, Trella, he said he was  born on Jupiter. A human could  stand the gravity of Jupiter, inside  a dome or a ship, but what  human could stand the rocket acceleration  necessary to break  free of Jupiter? Here's a man  strong enough to break a spaceship  safety belt just by getting  up out of his chair against it,  tough enough to take a beating  with a heavy stick without being  injured. How can you believe  he's really human?\u201d\n\n\n Trella remembered the thug  Kregg striking Quest in the face  and then crying that he had injured  his hand on the bar.\n\n\n \u201cBut he said Dr. Mansard was  his father,\u201d protested Trella.\n\n\n \u201cRobots and androids frequently  look on their makers as  their parents,\u201d said Jakdane.  \u201cQuest may not even know he's  57  artificial. Do you know how  Mansard died?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThe oxygen equipment failed,  Quest said.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYes. Do you know when?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo. Quest never did tell me,  that I remember.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHe told me: a year before  Quest made his rocket flight to  Ganymede! If the oxygen equipment  failed, how do you think  Quest  lived in the poisonous atmosphere  of Jupiter, if he's human?\u201d\n\n\n Trella was silent.\n\n\n \u201cFor the protection of humans,  there are two psychological  traits built into every robot  and android,\u201d said Jakdane  gently. \u201cThe first is that they  can never, under any circumstances,  attack a human being,  even in self defense. The second  is that, while they may understand  sexual desire objectively,  they can never experience it  themselves.\n\n\n \u201cThose characteristics fit your  man Quest to a T, Trella. There  is no other explanation for him:  he must be an android.\u201d Trella did not want to believe  Jakdane was right, but his reasoning  was unassailable. Looking  upon Quest as an android,  many things were explained: his  great strength, his short, broad  build, his immunity to injury,  his refusal to defend himself  against a human, his inability to  return Trella's love for him.\n\n\n It was not inconceivable that  she should have unknowingly  fallen in love with an android.  Humans could love androids,  with real affection, even knowing  that they were artificial.  There were instances of android  nursemaids who were virtually  members of the families owning  them.\n\n\n She was glad now that she  had not told Quest of her mission  to Ganymede. He thought  he was Dr. Mansard's son, but  an android had no legal right of  inheritance from his owner. She  would leave it to Dom Blessing  to decide what to do about Quest.\n\n\n Thus she did not, as she had  intended originally, speak to  Quest about seeing him again  after she had completed her assignment.  Even if Jakdane was  wrong and Quest was human\u2014as  now seemed unlikely\u2014Quest  had told her he could not love  her. Her best course was to try  to forget him.\n\n\n Nor did Quest try to arrange  with her for a later meeting.\n\n\n \u201cIt has been pleasant knowing  you, Trella,\u201d he said when they  left the G-boat at White Sands.  A faraway look came into his  blue eyes, and he added: \u201cI'm  sorry things couldn't have been  different, somehow.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cLet's don't be sorry for what  we can't help,\u201d she said gently,  taking his hand in farewell.\n\n\n Trella took a fast plane from  White Sands, and twenty-four  hours later walked up the front  steps of the familiar brownstone  house on the outskirts of Washington.\n\n\n Dom Blessing himself met her  at the door, a stooped, graying  58  man who peered at her over his  spectacles.\n\n\n \u201cYou have the papers, eh?\u201d  he said, spying the brief case.  \u201cGood, good. Come in and we'll  see what we have, eh?\u201d\n\n\n She accompanied him through  the bare, windowless anteroom  which had always seemed to her  such a strange feature of this  luxurious house, and they entered  the big living room. They sat  before a fire in the old-fashioned  fireplace and Blessing opened the  brief case with trembling hands.\n\n\n \u201cThere are things here,\u201d he  said, his eyes sparkling as he  glanced through the notebooks.  \u201cYes, there are things here. We  shall make something of these,  Miss Trella, eh?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI'm glad they're something  you can use, Mr. Blessing,\u201d she  said. \u201cThere's something else I  found on my trip, that I think  I should tell you about.\u201d\n\n\n She told him about Quest.\n\n\n \u201cHe thinks he's the son of Dr.  Mansard,\u201d she finished, \u201cbut apparently  he is, without knowing  it, an android Dr. Mansard built  on Jupiter.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHe came back to Earth with  you, eh?\u201d asked Blessing intently.\n\n\n \u201cYes. I'm afraid it's your decision  whether to let him go on  living as a man or to tell him  he's an android and claim ownership  as Dr. Mansard's heir.\u201d\n\n\n Trella planned to spend a few  days resting in her employer's  spacious home, and then to take  a short vacation before resuming  her duties as his confidential  secretary. The next morning  when she came down from her  room, a change had been made.\n\n\n Two armed men were with  Dom Blessing at breakfast and  accompanied him wherever he  went. She discovered that two  more men with guns were stationed  in the bare anteroom and  a guard was stationed at every  entrance to the house.\n\n\n \u201cWhy all the protection?\u201d she  asked Blessing.\n\n\n \u201cA wealthy man must be careful,\u201d  said Blessing cheerfully.  \u201cWhen we don't understand all  the implications of new circumstances,  we must be prepared for  anything, eh?\u201d\n\n\n There was only one new circumstance  Trella could think  of. Without actually intending  to, she exclaimed:\n\n\n \u201cYou aren't afraid of Quest?  Why, an android can't hurt a  human!\u201d\n\n\n Blessing peered at her over his  spectacles.\n\n\n \u201cAnd what if he isn't an android,  eh? And if he is\u2014what if  old Mansard didn't build in the  prohibition against harming humans  that's required by law?  What about that, eh?\u201d\n\n\n Trella was silent, shocked.  There was something here she  hadn't known about, hadn't even  suspected. For some reason, Dom  Blessing feared Dr. Eriklund  Mansard \u2026 or his heir \u2026 or  his mechanical servant. She was sure that Blessing  was wrong, that Quest, whether  man or android, intended no  59  harm to him. Surely, Quest  would have said something of  such bitterness during their long  time together on Ganymede and  aspace, since he did not know of  Trella's connection with Blessing.  But, since this was to be  the atmosphere of Blessing's  house, she was glad that he decided  to assign her to take the  Mansard papers to the New  York laboratory.\n\n\n Quest came the day before she  was scheduled to leave.\n\n\n Trella was in the living room  with Blessing, discussing the instructions  she was to give to the  laboratory officials in New York.  The two bodyguards were with  them. The other guards were at  their posts.\n\n\n Trella heard the doorbell ring.  The heavy oaken front door was  kept locked now, and the guards  in the anteroom examined callers  through a tiny window.\n\n\n Suddenly alarm bells rang all  over the house. There was a terrific  crash outside the room as  the front door splintered. There  were shouts and the sound of a  shot.\n\n\n \u201cThe steel doors!\u201d cried Blessing,  turning white. \u201cLet's get  out of here.\u201d\n\n\n He and his bodyguards ran  through the back of the house  out of the garage.\n\n\n Blessing, ahead of the rest,  leaped into one of the cars and  started the engine.\n\n\n The door from the house shattered  and Quest burst through.  The two guards turned and fired  together.\n\n\n He could be hurt by bullets.  He was staggered momentarily.\n\n\n Then, in a blur of motion, he  sprang forward and swept the  guards aside with one hand with  such force that they skidded  across the floor and lay in an  unconscious heap against the  rear of the garage. Trella had  opened the door of the car, but  it was wrenched from her hand  as Blessing stepped on the accelerator  and it leaped into the  driveway with spinning wheels.\n\n\n Quest was after it, like a  chunky deer, running faster  than Trella had ever seen a man  run before.\n\n\n Blessing slowed for the turn  at the end of the driveway and  glanced back over his shoulder.  Seeing Quest almost upon him,  he slammed down the accelerator  and twisted the wheel hard.\n\n\n The car whipped into the  street, careened, and rolled over  and over, bringing up against a  tree on the other side in a twisted  tangle of wreckage.\n\n\n With a horrified gasp, Trella  ran down the driveway toward  the smoking heap of metal.  Quest was already beside it,  probing it. As she reached his  side, he lifted the torn body of  Dom Blessing. Blessing was  dead.\n\n\n \u201cI'm lucky,\u201d said Quest soberly.  \u201cI would have murdered  him.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut why, Quest? I knew he  was afraid of you, but he didn't  tell me why.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt was conditioned into me,\u201d  answered Quest \u201cI didn't know  60  it until just now, when it ended,  but my father conditioned me  psychologically from my birth  to the task of hunting down  Dom Blessing and killing him. It  was an unconscious drive in me  that wouldn't release me until  the task was finished.\n\n\n \u201cYou see, Blessing was my father's  assistant on Ganymede.  Right after my father completed  development of the surgiscope,  he and my mother blasted off for  Io. Blessing wanted the valuable  rights to the surgiscope, and he  sabotaged the ship's drive so it  would fall into Jupiter.\n\n\n \u201cBut my father was able to  control it in the heavy atmosphere  of Jupiter, and landed it  successfully. I was born there,  and he conditioned me to come  to Earth and track down Blessing.  I know now that it was  part of the conditioning that I  was unable to fight any other  man until my task was finished:  it might have gotten me in trouble  and diverted me from that  purpose.\u201d\n\n\n More gently than Trella would  have believed possible for his  Jupiter-strong muscles, Quest  took her in his arms.\n\n\n \u201cNow I can say I love you,\u201d  he said. \u201cThat was part of the  conditioning too: I couldn't love  any woman until my job was  done.\u201d\n\n\n Trella disengaged herself.\n\n\n \u201cI'm sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cDon't  you know this, too, now: that  you're not a man, but an android?\u201d\n\n\n He looked at her in astonishment,  stunned by her words.\n\n\n \u201cWhat in space makes you  think that?\u201d he demanded.\n\n\n \u201cWhy, Quest, it's obvious,\u201d  she cried, tears in her eyes.  \u201cEverything about you \u2026 your  build, suited for Jupiter's gravity \u2026  your strength \u2026 the  fact that you were able to live  in Jupiter's atmosphere after  the oxygen equipment failed.  I know you think Dr. Mansard  was your father, but androids  often believe that.\u201d\n\n\n He grinned at her.\n\n\n \u201cI'm no android,\u201d he said confidently.  \u201cDo you forget my father  was inventor of the surgiscope?  He knew I'd have to grow  up on Jupiter, and he operated  on the genes before I was born.  He altered my inherited characteristics  to adapt me to the climate  of Jupiter \u2026 even to  being able to breathe a chlorine  atmosphere as well as an oxygen  atmosphere.\u201d\n\n\n Trella looked at him. He was  not badly hurt, any more than  an elephant would have been,  but his tunic was stained with  red blood where the bullets had  struck him. Normal android  blood was green.\n\n\n \u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d she  asked doubtfully.\n\n\n \u201cAndroids are made,\u201d he answered  with a laugh. \u201cThey  don't grow up. And I remember  my boyhood on Jupiter very  well.\u201d\n\n\n He took her in his arms again,  and this time she did not resist.  His lips were very human. THE END ",

FONTENAY He was a living weapon of\n\n destruction\u2014  immeasurably\n\n powerful, utterly invulnerable.\n\n There was only one\n\n question: Was he human? Trella  feared she was in  for trouble even before Motwick's  head dropped forward on  his arms in a drunken stupor.  The two evil-looking men at the  table nearby had been watching  her surreptitiously, and now  they shifted restlessly in their  chairs.\n\n\n Trella had not wanted to come  to the Golden Satellite. It was a  squalid saloon in the rougher  section of Jupiter's View, the  terrestrial dome-colony on Ganymede.  Motwick,  already  drunk,  had insisted.\n\n\n A woman could not possibly  make her way through these  streets alone to the better section  of town, especially one clad  in a silvery evening dress. Her  only hope was that this place  had a telephone. Perhaps she  could call one of Motwick's  friends; she had no one on Ganymede  she could call a real friend  herself.\n\n\n Tentatively, she pushed her  chair back from the table and  arose. She had to brush close by  the other table to get to the bar.  As she did, the dark, slick-haired  man reached out and grabbed  her around the waist with a  steely arm.\n\n\n Trella swung with her whole  body, and slapped him so hard  he nearly fell from his chair. As  she walked swiftly toward the  bar, he leaped up to follow her.\n\n\n There were only two other  people in the Golden Satellite:  the fat, mustached bartender  and a short, square-built man at  the bar. The latter swung  around at the pistol-like report  of her slap, and she saw that,  though no more than four and a  half feet tall, he was as heavily  muscled as a lion.\n\n\n 51  His face was clean and open,  with close-cropped blond hair  and honest blue eyes. She ran to  him.\n\n\n \u201cHelp me!\u201d she cried. \u201cPlease  help me!\u201d\n\n\n He began to back away from  her.\n\n\n \u201cI can't,\u201d he muttered in a  deep voice. \u201cI can't help you. I  can't do anything.\u201d The dark man was at her  heels. In desperation, she dodged  around the short man and took  refuge behind him. Her protector  was obviously unwilling, but  the dark man, faced with his  massiveness, took no chances.  He stopped and shouted:\n\n\n \u201cKregg!\u201d\n\n\n The other man at the table  arose, ponderously, and lumbered  toward them. He was immense,  at least six and a half  feet tall, with a brutal, vacant  face.\n\n\n Evading her attempts to stay  behind him, the squat man began  to move down the bar away  from the approaching Kregg.  The dark man moved in on  Trella again as Kregg overtook  his quarry and swung a huge  fist like a sledgehammer.\n\n\n Exactly what happened, Trella  wasn't sure. She had the impression  that Kregg's fist connected  squarely with the short man's  chin  before  he dodged to one  side in a movement so fast it  was a blur. But that couldn't  have been, because the short  man wasn't moved by that blow  that would have felled a steer,  and Kregg roared in pain, grabbing  his injured fist.\n\n\n \u201cThe bar!\u201d yelled Kregg. \u201cI  hit the damn bar!\u201d\n\n\n At this juncture, the bartender  took a hand. Leaning far  over the bar, he swung a full  bottle in a complete arc. It  smashed on Kregg's head,  splashing the floor with liquor,  and Kregg sank stunned to his  knees. The dark man, who had  grabbed Trella's arm, released  her and ran for the door.\n\n\n Moving agilely around the end  of the bar, the bartender stood  over Kregg, holding the jagged-edged  bottleneck in his hand  menacingly.\n\n\n \u201cGet out!\u201d rumbled the bartender.  \u201cI'll have no coppers  raiding my place for the likes of  you!\u201d\n\n\n Kregg stumbled to his feet  and staggered out. Trella ran to  the unconscious Motwick's side.\n\n\n \u201cThat means you, too, lady,\u201d  said the bartender beside her.  \u201cYou and your boy friend get  out of here. You oughtn't to  have come here in the first  place.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMay I help you, Miss?\u201d asked  a deep, resonant voice behind  her.\n\n\n She straightened from her  anxious examination of Motwick.  The squat man was standing  there, an apologetic look on  his face.\n\n\n She looked contemptuously at  the massive muscles whose help  had been denied her. Her arm  ached where the dark man had  grasped it. The broad face before  52  her was not unhandsome,  and the blue eyes were disconcertingly  direct, but she despised  him for a coward.\n\n\n \u201cI'm sorry I couldn't fight  those men for you, Miss, but I  just couldn't,\u201d he said miserably,  as though reading her thoughts.  \u201cBut no one will bother you on  the street if I'm with you.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cA lot of protection you'd be  if they did!\u201d she snapped. \u201cBut  I'm desperate. You can carry  him to the Stellar Hotel for me.\u201d The gravity of Ganymede was  hardly more than that of Earth's  moon, but the way the man  picked up the limp Motwick with  one hand and tossed him over a  shoulder was startling: as  though he lifted a feather pillow.  He followed Trella out the door  of the Golden Satellite and fell  in step beside her. Immediately  she was grateful for his presence.  The dimly lighted street  was not crowded, but she didn't  like the looks of the men she  saw.\n\n\n The transparent dome of Jupiter's  View was faintly visible  in the reflected night lights of  the colonial city, but the lights  were overwhelmed by the giant,  vari-colored disc of Jupiter itself,  riding high in the sky.\n\n\n \u201cI'm Quest Mansard, Miss,\u201d  said her companion. \u201cI'm just in  from Jupiter.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI'm Trella Nuspar,\u201d she said,  favoring him with a green-eyed  glance. \u201cYou mean Io, don't you\u2014or  Moon Five?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo,\u201d he said, grinning at  her. He had an engaging grin,  with even white teeth. \u201cI meant  Jupiter.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou're lying,\u201d she said flatly.  \u201cNo one has ever landed on  Jupiter. It would be impossible  to blast off again.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMy parents landed on Jupiter,  and I blasted off from it,\u201d  he said soberly. \u201cI was born  there. Have you ever heard of  Dr. Eriklund Mansard?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI certainly have,\u201d she said,  her interest taking a sudden  upward turn. \u201cHe developed the  surgiscope, didn't he? But his  ship was drawn into Jupiter and  lost.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt was drawn into Jupiter,  but he landed it successfully,\u201d  said Quest. \u201cHe and my mother  lived on Jupiter until the oxygen  equipment wore out at last. I  was born and brought up there,  and I was finally able to build  a small rocket with a powerful  enough drive to clear the  planet.\u201d\n\n\n She looked at him. He was  short, half a head shorter than  she, but broad and powerful as  a man might be who had grown  up in heavy gravity. He trod the  street with a light, controlled  step, seeming to deliberately  hold himself down.\n\n\n \u201cIf Dr. Mansard succeeded in  landing on Jupiter, why didn't  anyone ever hear from him  again?\u201d she demanded.\n\n\n \u201cBecause,\u201d said Quest, \u201chis  radio was sabotaged, just as his  ship's drive was.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cJupiter strength,\u201d she murmured,  looking him over coolly.  53  \u201cYou wear Motwick on your  shoulder like a scarf. But you  couldn't bring yourself to help  a woman against two thugs.\u201d\n\n\n He flushed.\n\n\n \u201cI'm sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's  something I couldn't help.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don't know. It's not that  I'm afraid, but there's something  in me that makes me back  away from the prospect of fighting  anyone.\u201d\n\n\n Trella sighed. Cowardice was  a state of mind. It was peculiarly  inappropriate, but not unbelievable,  that the strongest and  most agile man on Ganymede  should be a coward. Well, she  thought with a rush of sympathy,  he couldn't help being  what he was. They had reached the more  brightly lighted section of the  city now. Trella could get a cab  from here, but the Stellar Hotel  wasn't far. They walked on.\n\n\n Trella had the desk clerk call  a cab to deliver the unconscious  Motwick to his home. She and  Quest had a late sandwich in the  coffee shop.\n\n\n \u201cI landed here only a week  ago,\u201d he told her, his eyes frankly  admiring her honey-colored  hair and comely face. \u201cI'm heading  for Earth on the next spaceship.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWe'll be traveling companions,  then,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm going  back on that ship, too.\u201d\n\n\n For some reason she decided  against telling him that the  assignment on which she had  come to the Jupiter system was  to gather his own father's notebooks  and take them back to  Earth. Motwick was an irresponsible  playboy whom Trella had known  briefly on Earth, and Trella was  glad to dispense with his company  for the remaining three  weeks before the spaceship  blasted off. She found herself  enjoying the steadier companionship  of Quest.\n\n\n As a matter of fact, she found  herself enjoying his companionship  more than she intended to.  She found herself falling in love  with him.\n\n\n Now this did not suit her at  all. Trella had always liked her  men tall and dark. She had determined  that when she married  it would be to a curly-haired six-footer.\n\n\n She was not at all happy about  being so strongly attracted to a  man several inches shorter than  she. She was particularly unhappy  about feeling drawn to a  man who was a coward.\n\n\n The ship that they boarded on  Moon Nine was one of the newer  ships that could attain a hundred-mile-per-second  velocity  and take a hyperbolic path to  Earth, but it would still require  fifty-four days to make the trip.  So Trella was delighted to find  that the ship was the Cometfire and its skipper was her old  friend, dark-eyed, curly-haired  Jakdane Gille.\n\n\n \u201cJakdane,\u201d she said, flirting  with him with her eyes as in  54  days gone by, \u201cI need a chaperon  this trip, and you're ideal for  the job.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI never thought of myself in  quite that light, but maybe  I'm getting old,\u201d he answered,  laughing. \u201cWhat's your trouble,  Trella?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI'm in love with that huge  chunk of man who came aboard  with me, and I'm not sure I  ought to be,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI  may need protection against myself  till we get to Earth.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIf it's to keep you out of another  fellow's clutches, I'm your  man,\u201d agreed Jakdane heartily.  \u201cI always had a mind to save  you for myself. I'll guarantee  you won't have a moment alone  with him the whole trip.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou don't have to be that  thorough about it,\u201d she protested  hastily. \u201cI want to get a little  enjoyment out of being in love.  But if I feel myself weakening  too much, I'll holler for help.\u201d\n\n\n The Cometfire swung around  great Jupiter in an opening arc  and plummeted ever more swiftly  toward the tight circles of the  inner planets. There were four  crew members and three passengers  aboard the ship's tiny personnel  sphere, and Trella was  thrown with Quest almost constantly.  She enjoyed every minute  of it.\n\n\n She told him only that she  was a messenger, sent out to  Ganymede to pick up some important  papers and take them  back to Earth. She was tempted  to tell him what the papers were.  Her employer had impressed upon  her that her mission was confidential,  but surely Dom  Blessing  could not object to Dr.  Mansard's son knowing about it.\n\n\n All these things had happened  before she was born, and she  did not know what Dom Blessing's  relation to Dr. Mansard  had been, but it must have been  very close. She knew that Dr.  Mansard had invented the surgiscope.\n\n\n This was an instrument with  a three-dimensional screen as its  heart. The screen was a cubical  frame in which an apparently  solid image was built up of an  object under an electron microscope. The actual cutting instrument  of the surgiscope was an ion  stream. By operating a tool in  the three-dimensional screen,  corresponding movements were  made by the ion stream on the  object under the microscope.  The  principle  was the same as  that used in operation of remote  control \u201chands\u201d in atomic laboratories  to handle hot material,  and with the surgiscope very  delicate operations could be performed  at the cellular level.\n\n\n Dr. Mansard and his wife had  disappeared into the turbulent  atmosphere of Jupiter just after  his invention of the surgiscope,  and it had been developed by  Dom Blessing. Its success had  built Spaceway Instruments, Incorporated,  which Blessing headed.\n\n\n Through all these years since  Dr. Mansard's disappearance,  55  Blessing had been searching the  Jovian moons for a second, hidden  laboratory of Dr. Mansard.  When it was found at last, he  sent Trella, his most trusted  secretary, to Ganymede to bring  back to him the notebooks found  there.\n\n\n Blessing would, of course, be  happy to learn that a son of Dr.  Mansard lived, and would see  that he received his rightful  share of the inheritance. Because  of this, Trella was tempted  to tell Quest the good news  herself; but she decided against  it. It was Blessing's privilege to  do this his own way, and he  might not appreciate her meddling. At midtrip, Trella made a rueful  confession to Jakdane.\n\n\n \u201cIt seems I was taking unnecessary  precautions when I asked  you to be a chaperon,\u201d she said.  \u201cI kept waiting for Quest to do  something, and when he didn't  I told him I loved him.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt's very peculiar,\u201d she said  unhappily. \u201cHe said he  can't  love me. He said he wants to  love me and he feels that he  should, but there's something in  him that refuses to permit it.\u201d\n\n\n She expected Jakdane to salve  her wounded feelings with a  sympathetic pleasantry, but he  did not. Instead, he just looked  at her very thoughtfully and  said no more about the matter.\n\n\n He explained his attitude  after Asrange ran amuck.\n\n\n Asrange was the third passenger.  He was a lean, saturnine  individual who said little and  kept to himself as much as possible.  He was distantly polite in  his relations with both crew and  other passengers, and never  showed the slightest spark of  emotion \u2026 until the day Quest  squirted coffee on him.\n\n\n It was one of those accidents  that can occur easily in space.  The passengers and the two  crewmen on that particular waking  shift (including Jakdane)  were eating lunch on the center-deck.  Quest picked up his bulb  of coffee, but inadvertently  pressed it before he got it to his  lips. The coffee squirted all over  the front of Asrange's clean  white tunic.\n\n\n \u201cI'm sorry!\u201d exclaimed Quest  in distress.\n\n\n The man's eyes went wide and  he snarled. So quickly it seemed  impossible, he had unbuckled  himself from his seat and hurled  himself backward from the table  with an incoherent cry. He  seized the first object his hand  touched\u2014it happened to be a  heavy wooden cane leaning  against Jakdane's bunk\u2014propelled  himself like a projectile at  Quest.\n\n\n Quest rose from the table in  a sudden uncoiling of movement.  He did not unbuckle his safety  belt\u2014he rose and it snapped like  a string.\n\n\n For a moment Trella thought  he was going to meet Asrange's  assault. But he fled in a long  leap toward the companionway  leading to the astrogation deck  56  above. Landing feet-first in the  middle of the table and rebounding,  Asrange pursued with the  stick upraised.\n\n\n In his haste, Quest missed the  companionway in his leap and  was cornered against one of the  bunks. Asrange descended on  him like an avenging angel and,  holding onto the bunk with one  hand, rained savage blows on his  head and shoulders with the  heavy stick.\n\n\n Quest made no effort to retaliate.  He cowered under the attack,  holding his hands in front  of him as if to ward it off. In a  moment, Jakdane and the other  crewman had reached Asrange  and pulled him off. When they had Asrange in  irons, Jakdane turned to Quest,  who was now sitting unhappily  at the table.\n\n\n \u201cTake it easy,\u201d he advised.  \u201cI'll wake the psychosurgeon  and have him look you over. Just  stay there.\u201d\n\n\n Quest shook his head.\n\n\n \u201cDon't bother him,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt's nothing but a few bruises.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBruises? Man, that club  could have broken your skull!  Or a couple of ribs, at the very  least.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI'm all right,\u201d insisted  Quest; and when the skeptical  Jakdane insisted on examining  him carefully, he had to admit  it. There was hardly a mark on  him from the blows.\n\n\n \u201cIf it didn't hurt you any  more than that, why didn't you  take that stick away from him?\u201d  demanded Jakdane. \u201cYou could  have, easily.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI couldn't,\u201d said Quest miserably,  and turned his face  away.\n\n\n Later, alone with Trella on  the control deck, Jakdane gave  her some sober advice.\n\n\n \u201cIf you think you're in love  with Quest, forget it,\u201d he said.\n\n\n \u201cWhy? Because he's a coward?  I know that ought to make  me despise him, but it doesn't  any more.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNot because he's a coward.  Because he's an android!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat? Jakdane, you can't be  serious!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI am. I say he's an android,  an artificial imitation of a man.  It all figures.\n\n\n \u201cLook, Trella, he said he was  born on Jupiter. A human could  stand the gravity of Jupiter, inside  a dome or a ship, but what  human could stand the rocket acceleration  necessary to break  free of Jupiter? Here's a man  strong enough to break a spaceship  safety belt just by getting  up out of his chair against it,  tough enough to take a beating  with a heavy stick without being  injured. How can you believe  he's really human?\u201d\n\n\n Trella remembered the thug  Kregg striking Quest in the face  and then crying that he had injured  his hand on the bar.\n\n\n \u201cBut he said Dr. Mansard was  his father,\u201d protested Trella.\n\n\n \u201cRobots and androids frequently  look on their makers as  their parents,\u201d said Jakdane.  \u201cQuest may not even know he's  57  artificial. Do you know how  Mansard died?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThe oxygen equipment failed,  Quest said.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYes. Do you know when?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo. Quest never did tell me,  that I remember.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHe told me: a year before  Quest made his rocket flight to  Ganymede! If the oxygen equipment  failed, how do you think  Quest  lived in the poisonous atmosphere  of Jupiter, if he's human?\u201d\n\n\n Trella was silent.\n\n\n \u201cFor the protection of humans,  there are two psychological  traits built into every robot  and android,\u201d said Jakdane  gently. \u201cThe first is that they  can never, under any circumstances,  attack a human being,  even in self defense. The second  is that, while they may understand  sexual desire objectively,  they can never experience it  themselves.\n\n\n \u201cThose characteristics fit your  man Quest to a T, Trella. There  is no other explanation for him:  he must be an android.\u201d Trella did not want to believe  Jakdane was right, but his reasoning  was unassailable. Looking  upon Quest as an android,  many things were explained: his  great strength, his short, broad  build, his immunity to injury,  his refusal to defend himself  against a human, his inability to  return Trella's love for him.\n\n\n It was not inconceivable that  she should have unknowingly  fallen in love with an android.  Humans could love androids,  with real affection, even knowing  that they were artificial.  There were instances of android  nursemaids who were virtually  members of the families owning  them.\n\n\n She was glad now that she  had not told Quest of her mission  to Ganymede. He thought  he was Dr. Mansard's son, but  an android had no legal right of  inheritance from his owner. She  would leave it to Dom Blessing  to decide what to do about Quest.\n\n\n Thus she did not, as she had  intended originally, speak to  Quest about seeing him again  after she had completed her assignment.  Even if Jakdane was  wrong and Quest was human\u2014as  now seemed unlikely\u2014Quest  had told her he could not love  her. Her best course was to try  to forget him.\n\n\n Nor did Quest try to arrange  with her for a later meeting.\n\n\n \u201cIt has been pleasant knowing  you, Trella,\u201d he said when they  left the G-boat at White Sands.  A faraway look came into his  blue eyes, and he added: \u201cI'm  sorry things couldn't have been  different, somehow.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cLet's don't be sorry for what  we can't help,\u201d she said gently,  taking his hand in farewell.\n\n\n Trella took a fast plane from  White Sands, and twenty-four  hours later walked up the front  steps of the familiar brownstone  house on the outskirts of Washington.\n\n\n Dom Blessing himself met her  at the door, a stooped, graying  58  man who peered at her over his  spectacles.\n\n\n \u201cYou have the papers, eh?\u201d  he said, spying the brief case.  \u201cGood, good. Come in and we'll  see what we have, eh?\u201d\n\n\n She accompanied him through  the bare, windowless anteroom  which had always seemed to her  such a strange feature of this  luxurious house, and they entered  the big living room. They sat  before a fire in the old-fashioned  fireplace and Blessing opened the  brief case with trembling hands.\n\n\n \u201cThere are things here,\u201d he  said, his eyes sparkling as he  glanced through the notebooks.  \u201cYes, there are things here. We  shall make something of these,  Miss Trella, eh?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI'm glad they're something  you can use, Mr. Blessing,\u201d she  said. \u201cThere's something else I  found on my trip, that I think  I should tell you about.\u201d\n\n\n She told him about Quest.\n\n\n \u201cHe thinks he's the son of Dr.  Mansard,\u201d she finished, \u201cbut apparently  he is, without knowing  it, an android Dr. Mansard built  on Jupiter.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHe came back to Earth with  you, eh?\u201d asked Blessing intently.\n\n\n \u201cYes. I'm afraid it's your decision  whether to let him go on  living as a man or to tell him  he's an android and claim ownership  as Dr. Mansard's heir.\u201d\n\n\n Trella planned to spend a few  days resting in her employer's  spacious home, and then to take  a short vacation before resuming  her duties as his confidential  secretary. The next morning  when she came down from her  room, a change had been made.\n\n\n Two armed men were with  Dom Blessing at breakfast and  accompanied him wherever he  went. She discovered that two  more men with guns were stationed  in the bare anteroom and  a guard was stationed at every  entrance to the house.\n\n\n \u201cWhy all the protection?\u201d she  asked Blessing.\n\n\n \u201cA wealthy man must be careful,\u201d  said Blessing cheerfully.  \u201cWhen we don't understand all  the implications of new circumstances,  we must be prepared for  anything, eh?\u201d\n\n\n There was only one new circumstance  Trella could think  of. Without actually intending  to, she exclaimed:\n\n\n \u201cYou aren't afraid of Quest?  Why, an android can't hurt a  human!\u201d\n\n\n Blessing peered at her over his  spectacles.\n\n\n \u201cAnd what if he isn't an android,  eh? And if he is\u2014what if  old Mansard didn't build in the  prohibition against harming humans  that's required by law?  What about that, eh?\u201d\n\n\n Trella was silent, shocked.  There was something here she  hadn't known about, hadn't even  suspected. For some reason, Dom  Blessing feared Dr. Eriklund  Mansard \u2026 or his heir \u2026 or  his mechanical servant. She was sure that Blessing  was wrong, that Quest, whether  man or android, intended no  59  harm to him. Surely, Quest  would have said something of  such bitterness during their long  time together on Ganymede and  aspace, since he did not know of  Trella's connection with Blessing.  But, since this was to be  the atmosphere of Blessing's  house, she was glad that he decided  to assign her to take the  Mansard papers to the New  York laboratory.\n\n\n Quest came the day before she  was scheduled to leave.\n\n\n Trella was in the living room  with Blessing, discussing the instructions  she was to give to the  laboratory officials in New York.  The two bodyguards were with  them. The other guards were at  their posts.\n\n\n Trella heard the doorbell ring.  The heavy oaken front door was  kept locked now, and the guards  in the anteroom examined callers  through a tiny window.\n\n\n Suddenly alarm bells rang all  over the house. There was a terrific  crash outside the room as  the front door splintered. There  were shouts and the sound of a  shot.\n\n\n \u201cThe steel doors!\u201d cried Blessing,  turning white. \u201cLet's get  out of here.\u201d\n\n\n He and his bodyguards ran  through the back of the house  out of the garage.\n\n\n Blessing, ahead of the rest,  leaped into one of the cars and  started the engine.\n\n\n The door from the house shattered  and Quest burst through.  The two guards turned and fired  together.\n\n\n He could be hurt by bullets.  He was staggered momentarily.\n\n\n Then, in a blur of motion, he  sprang forward and swept the  guards aside with one hand with  such force that they skidded  across the floor and lay in an  unconscious heap against the  rear of the garage. Trella had  opened the door of the car, but  it was wrenched from her hand  as Blessing stepped on the accelerator  and it leaped into the  driveway with spinning wheels.\n\n\n Quest was after it, like a  chunky deer, running faster  than Trella had ever seen a man  run before.\n\n\n Blessing slowed for the turn  at the end of the driveway and  glanced back over his shoulder.  Seeing Quest almost upon him,  he slammed down the accelerator  and twisted the wheel hard.\n\n\n The car whipped into the  street, careened, and rolled over  and over, bringing up against a  tree on the other side in a twisted  tangle of wreckage.\n\n\n With a horrified gasp, Trella  ran down the driveway toward  the smoking heap of metal.  Quest was already beside it,  probing it. As she reached his  side, he lifted the torn body of  Dom Blessing. Blessing was  dead.\n\n\n \u201cI'm lucky,\u201d said Quest soberly.  \u201cI would have murdered  him.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut why, Quest? I knew he  was afraid of you, but he didn't  tell me why.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt was conditioned into me,\u201d  answered Quest \u201cI didn't know  60  it until just now, when it ended,  but my father conditioned me  psychologically from my birth  to the task of hunting down  Dom Blessing and killing him. It  was an unconscious drive in me  that wouldn't release me until  the task was finished.\n\n\n \u201cYou see, Blessing was my father's  assistant on Ganymede.  Right after my father completed  development of the surgiscope,  he and my mother blasted off for  Io. Blessing wanted the valuable  rights to the surgiscope, and he  sabotaged the ship's drive so it  would fall into Jupiter.\n\n\n \u201cBut my father was able to  control it in the heavy atmosphere  of Jupiter, and landed it  successfully. I was born there,  and he conditioned me to come  to Earth and track down Blessing.  I know now that it was  part of the conditioning that I  was unable to fight any other  man until my task was finished:  it might have gotten me in trouble  and diverted me from that  purpose.\u201d\n\n\n More gently than Trella would  have believed possible for his  Jupiter-strong muscles, Quest  took her in his arms.\n\n\n \u201cNow I can say I love you,\u201d  he said. \u201cThat was part of the  conditioning too: I couldn't love  any woman until my job was  done.\u201d\n\n\n Trella disengaged herself.\n\n\n \u201cI'm sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cDon't  you know this, too, now: that  you're not a man, but an android?\u201d\n\n\n He looked at her in astonishment,  stunned by her words.\n\n\n \u201cWhat in space makes you  think that?\u201d he demanded.\n\n\n \u201cWhy, Quest, it's obvious,\u201d  she cried, tears in her eyes.  \u201cEverything about you \u2026 your  build, suited for Jupiter's gravity \u2026  your strength \u2026 the  fact that you were able to live  in Jupiter's atmosphere after  the oxygen equipment failed.  I know you think Dr. Mansard  was your father, but androids  often believe that.\u201d\n\n\n He grinned at her.\n\n\n \u201cI'm no android,\u201d he said confidently.  \u201cDo you forget my father  was inventor of the surgiscope?  He knew I'd have to grow  up on Jupiter, and he operated  on the genes before I was born.  He altered my inherited characteristics  to adapt me to the climate  of Jupiter \u2026 even to  being able to breathe a chlorine  atmosphere as well as an oxygen  atmosphere.\u201d\n\n\n Trella looked at him. He was  not badly hurt, any more than  an elephant would have been,  but his tunic was stained with  red blood where the bullets had  struck him. Normal android  blood was green.\n\n\n \u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d she  asked doubtfully.\n\n\n \u201cAndroids are made,\u201d he answered  with a laugh. \u201cThey  don't grow up. And I remember  my boyhood on Jupiter very  well.\u201d\n\n\n He took her in his arms again,  and this time she did not resist.  His lips were very human.

FONTENAY He was a living weapon of\n\n destruction\u2014  immeasurably\n\n powerful, utterly invulnerable.\n\n There was only one\n\n question: Was he human? Trella  feared she was in  for trouble even before Motwick's  head dropped forward on  his arms in a drunken stupor.  The two evil-looking men at the  table nearby had been watching  her surreptitiously, and now  they shifted restlessly in their  chairs.\n\n\n Trella had not wanted to come  to the Golden Satellite. It was a  squalid saloon in the rougher  section of Jupiter's View, the  terrestrial dome-colony on Ganymede.  Motwick,  already  drunk,  had insisted.\n\n\n A woman could not possibly  make her way through these  streets alone to the better section  of town, especially one clad  in a silvery evening dress. Her  only hope was that this place  had a telephone. Perhaps she  could call one of Motwick's  friends; she had no one on Ganymede  she could call a real friend  herself.\n\n\n Tentatively, she pushed her  chair back from the table and  arose. She had to brush close by  the other table to get to the bar.  As she did, the dark, slick-haired  man reached out and grabbed  her around the waist with a  steely arm.\n\n\n Trella swung with her whole  body, and slapped him so hard  he nearly fell from his chair. As  she walked swiftly toward the  bar, he leaped up to follow her.\n\n\n There were only two other  people in the Golden Satellite:  the fat, mustached bartender  and a short, square-built man at  the bar. The latter swung  around at the pistol-like report  of her slap, and she saw that,  though no more than four and a  half feet tall, he was as heavily  muscled as a lion.\n\n\n 51  His face was clean and open,  with close-cropped blond hair  and honest blue eyes. She ran to  him.\n\n\n \u201cHelp me!\u201d she cried. \u201cPlease  help me!\u201d\n\n\n He began to back away from  her.\n\n\n \u201cI can't,\u201d he muttered in a  deep voice. \u201cI can't help you. I  can't do anything.\u201d The dark man was at her  heels. In desperation, she dodged  around the short man and took  refuge behind him. Her protector  was obviously unwilling, but  the dark man, faced with his  massiveness, took no chances.  He stopped and shouted:\n\n\n \u201cKregg!\u201d\n\n\n The other man at the table  arose, ponderously, and lumbered  toward them. He was immense,  at least six and a half  feet tall, with a brutal, vacant  face.\n\n\n Evading her attempts to stay  behind him, the squat man began  to move down the bar away  from the approaching Kregg.  The dark man moved in on  Trella again as Kregg overtook  his quarry and swung a huge  fist like a sledgehammer.\n\n\n Exactly what happened, Trella  wasn't sure. She had the impression  that Kregg's fist connected  squarely with the short man's  chin  before  he dodged to one  side in a movement so fast it  was a blur. But that couldn't  have been, because the short  man wasn't moved by that blow  that would have felled a steer,  and Kregg roared in pain, grabbing  his injured fist.\n\n\n \u201cThe bar!\u201d yelled Kregg. \u201cI  hit the damn bar!\u201d\n\n\n At this juncture, the bartender  took a hand. Leaning far  over the bar, he swung a full  bottle in a complete arc. It  smashed on Kregg's head,  splashing the floor with liquor,  and Kregg sank stunned to his  knees. The dark man, who had  grabbed Trella's arm, released  her and ran for the door.\n\n\n Moving agilely around the end  of the bar, the bartender stood  over Kregg, holding the jagged-edged  bottleneck in his hand  menacingly.\n\n\n \u201cGet out!\u201d rumbled the bartender.  \u201cI'll have no coppers  raiding my place for the likes of  you!\u201d\n\n\n Kregg stumbled to his feet  and staggered out. Trella ran to  the unconscious Motwick's side.\n\n\n \u201cThat means you, too, lady,\u201d  said the bartender beside her.  \u201cYou and your boy friend get  out of here. You oughtn't to  have come here in the first  place.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMay I help you, Miss?\u201d asked  a deep, resonant voice behind  her.\n\n\n She straightened from her  anxious examination of Motwick.  The squat man was standing  there, an apologetic look on  his face.\n\n\n She looked contemptuously at  the massive muscles whose help  had been denied her. Her arm  ached where the dark man had  grasped it. The broad face before  52  her was not unhandsome,  and the blue eyes were disconcertingly  direct, but she despised  him for a coward.\n\n\n \u201cI'm sorry I couldn't fight  those men for you, Miss, but I  just couldn't,\u201d he said miserably,  as though reading her thoughts.  \u201cBut no one will bother you on  the street if I'm with you.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cA lot of protection you'd be  if they did!\u201d she snapped. \u201cBut  I'm desperate. You can carry  him to the Stellar Hotel for me.\u201d The gravity of Ganymede was  hardly more than that of Earth's  moon, but the way the man  picked up the limp Motwick with  one hand and tossed him over a  shoulder was startling: as  though he lifted a feather pillow.  He followed Trella out the door  of the Golden Satellite and fell  in step beside her. Immediately  she was grateful for his presence.  The dimly lighted street  was not crowded, but she didn't  like the looks of the men she  saw.\n\n\n The transparent dome of Jupiter's  View was faintly visible  in the reflected night lights of  the colonial city, but the lights  were overwhelmed by the giant,  vari-colored disc of Jupiter itself,  riding high in the sky.\n\n\n \u201cI'm Quest Mansard, Miss,\u201d  said her companion. \u201cI'm just in  from Jupiter.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI'm Trella Nuspar,\u201d she said,  favoring him with a green-eyed  glance. \u201cYou mean Io, don't you\u2014or  Moon Five?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo,\u201d he said, grinning at  her. He had an engaging grin,  with even white teeth. \u201cI meant  Jupiter.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou're lying,\u201d she said flatly.  \u201cNo one has ever landed on  Jupiter. It would be impossible  to blast off again.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMy parents landed on Jupiter,  and I blasted off from it,\u201d  he said soberly. \u201cI was born  there. Have you ever heard of  Dr. Eriklund Mansard?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI certainly have,\u201d she said,  her interest taking a sudden  upward turn. \u201cHe developed the  surgiscope, didn't he? But his  ship was drawn into Jupiter and  lost.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt was drawn into Jupiter,  but he landed it successfully,\u201d  said Quest. \u201cHe and my mother  lived on Jupiter until the oxygen  equipment wore out at last. I  was born and brought up there,  and I was finally able to build  a small rocket with a powerful  enough drive to clear the  planet.\u201d\n\n\n She looked at him. He was  short, half a head shorter than  she, but broad and powerful as  a man might be who had grown  up in heavy gravity. He trod the  street with a light, controlled  step, seeming to deliberately  hold himself down.\n\n\n \u201cIf Dr. Mansard succeeded in  landing on Jupiter, why didn't  anyone ever hear from him  again?\u201d she demanded.\n\n\n \u201cBecause,\u201d said Quest, \u201chis  radio was sabotaged, just as his  ship's drive was.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cJupiter strength,\u201d she murmured,  looking him over coolly.  53  \u201cYou wear Motwick on your  shoulder like a scarf. But you  couldn't bring yourself to help  a woman against two thugs.\u201d\n\n\n He flushed.\n\n\n \u201cI'm sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's  something I couldn't help.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don't know. It's not that  I'm afraid, but there's something  in me that makes me back  away from the prospect of fighting  anyone.\u201d\n\n\n Trella sighed. Cowardice was  a state of mind. It was peculiarly  inappropriate, but not unbelievable,  that the strongest and  most agile man on Ganymede  should be a coward. Well, she  thought with a rush of sympathy,  he couldn't help being  what he was. They had reached the more  brightly lighted section of the  city now. Trella could get a cab  from here, but the Stellar Hotel  wasn't far. They walked on.\n\n\n Trella had the desk clerk call  a cab to deliver the unconscious  Motwick to his home. She and  Quest had a late sandwich in the  coffee shop.\n\n\n \u201cI landed here only a week  ago,\u201d he told her, his eyes frankly  admiring her honey-colored  hair and comely face. \u201cI'm heading  for Earth on the next spaceship.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWe'll be traveling companions,  then,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm going  back on that ship, too.\u201d\n\n\n For some reason she decided  against telling him that the  assignment on which she had  come to the Jupiter system was  to gather his own father's notebooks  and take them back to  Earth. Motwick was an irresponsible  playboy whom Trella had known  briefly on Earth, and Trella was  glad to dispense with his company  for the remaining three  weeks before the spaceship  blasted off. She found herself  enjoying the steadier companionship  of Quest.\n\n\n As a matter of fact, she found  herself enjoying his companionship  more than she intended to.  She found herself falling in love  with him.\n\n\n Now this did not suit her at  all. Trella had always liked her  men tall and dark. She had determined  that when she married  it would be to a curly-haired six-footer.\n\n\n She was not at all happy about  being so strongly attracted to a  man several inches shorter than  she. She was particularly unhappy  about feeling drawn to a  man who was a coward.\n\n\n The ship that they boarded on  Moon Nine was one of the newer  ships that could attain a hundred-mile-per-second  velocity  and take a hyperbolic path to  Earth, but it would still require  fifty-four days to make the trip.  So Trella was delighted to find  that the ship was the Cometfire and its skipper was her old  friend, dark-eyed, curly-haired  Jakdane Gille.\n\n\n \u201cJakdane,\u201d she said, flirting  with him with her eyes as in  54  days gone by, \u201cI need a chaperon  this trip, and you're ideal for  the job.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI never thought of myself in  quite that light, but maybe  I'm getting old,\u201d he answered,  laughing. \u201cWhat's your trouble,  Trella?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI'm in love with that huge  chunk of man who came aboard  with me, and I'm not sure I  ought to be,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI  may need protection against myself  till we get to Earth.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIf it's to keep you out of another  fellow's clutches, I'm your  man,\u201d agreed Jakdane heartily.  \u201cI always had a mind to save  you for myself. I'll guarantee  you won't have a moment alone  with him the whole trip.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou don't have to be that  thorough about it,\u201d she protested  hastily. \u201cI want to get a little  enjoyment out of being in love.  But if I feel myself weakening  too much, I'll holler for help.\u201d\n\n\n The Cometfire swung around  great Jupiter in an opening arc  and plummeted ever more swiftly  toward the tight circles of the  inner planets. There were four  crew members and three passengers  aboard the ship's tiny personnel  sphere, and Trella was  thrown with Quest almost constantly.  She enjoyed every minute  of it.\n\n\n She told him only that she  was a messenger, sent out to  Ganymede to pick up some important  papers and take them  back to Earth. She was tempted  to tell him what the papers were.  Her employer had impressed upon  her that her mission was confidential,  but surely Dom  Blessing  could not object to Dr.  Mansard's son knowing about it.\n\n\n All these things had happened  before she was born, and she  did not know what Dom Blessing's  relation to Dr. Mansard  had been, but it must have been  very close. She knew that Dr.  Mansard had invented the surgiscope.\n\n\n This was an instrument with  a three-dimensional screen as its  heart. The screen was a cubical  frame in which an apparently  solid image was built up of an  object under an electron microscope. The actual cutting instrument  of the surgiscope was an ion  stream. By operating a tool in  the three-dimensional screen,  corresponding movements were  made by the ion stream on the  object under the microscope.  The  principle  was the same as  that used in operation of remote  control \u201chands\u201d in atomic laboratories  to handle hot material,  and with the surgiscope very  delicate operations could be performed  at the cellular level.\n\n\n Dr. Mansard and his wife had  disappeared into the turbulent  atmosphere of Jupiter just after  his invention of the surgiscope,  and it had been developed by  Dom Blessing. Its success had  built Spaceway Instruments, Incorporated,  which Blessing headed.\n\n\n Through all these years since  Dr. Mansard's disappearance,  55  Blessing had been searching the  Jovian moons for a second, hidden  laboratory of Dr. Mansard.  When it was found at last, he  sent Trella, his most trusted  secretary, to Ganymede to bring  back to him the notebooks found  there.\n\n\n Blessing would, of course, be  happy to learn that a son of Dr.  Mansard lived, and would see  that he received his rightful  share of the inheritance. Because  of this, Trella was tempted  to tell Quest the good news  herself; but she decided against  it. It was Blessing's privilege to  do this his own way, and he  might not appreciate her meddling. At midtrip, Trella made a rueful  confession to Jakdane.\n\n\n \u201cIt seems I was taking unnecessary  precautions when I asked  you to be a chaperon,\u201d she said.  \u201cI kept waiting for Quest to do  something, and when he didn't  I told him I loved him.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt's very peculiar,\u201d she said  unhappily. \u201cHe said he  can't  love me. He said he wants to  love me and he feels that he  should, but there's something in  him that refuses to permit it.\u201d\n\n\n She expected Jakdane to salve  her wounded feelings with a  sympathetic pleasantry, but he  did not. Instead, he just looked  at her very thoughtfully and  said no more about the matter.\n\n\n He explained his attitude  after Asrange ran amuck.\n\n\n Asrange was the third passenger.  He was a lean, saturnine  individual who said little and  kept to himself as much as possible.  He was distantly polite in  his relations with both crew and  other passengers, and never  showed the slightest spark of  emotion \u2026 until the day Quest  squirted coffee on him.\n\n\n It was one of those accidents  that can occur easily in space.  The passengers and the two  crewmen on that particular waking  shift (including Jakdane)  were eating lunch on the center-deck.  Quest picked up his bulb  of coffee, but inadvertently  pressed it before he got it to his  lips. The coffee squirted all over  the front of Asrange's clean  white tunic.\n\n\n \u201cI'm sorry!\u201d exclaimed Quest  in distress.\n\n\n The man's eyes went wide and  he snarled. So quickly it seemed  impossible, he had unbuckled  himself from his seat and hurled  himself backward from the table  with an incoherent cry. He  seized the first object his hand  touched\u2014it happened to be a  heavy wooden cane leaning  against Jakdane's bunk\u2014propelled  himself like a projectile at  Quest.\n\n\n Quest rose from the table in  a sudden uncoiling of movement.  He did not unbuckle his safety  belt\u2014he rose and it snapped like  a string.\n\n\n For a moment Trella thought  he was going to meet Asrange's  assault. But he fled in a long  leap toward the companionway  leading to the astrogation deck  56  above. Landing feet-first in the  middle of the table and rebounding,  Asrange pursued with the  stick upraised.\n\n\n In his haste, Quest missed the  companionway in his leap and  was cornered against one of the  bunks. Asrange descended on  him like an avenging angel and,  holding onto the bunk with one  hand, rained savage blows on his  head and shoulders with the  heavy stick.\n\n\n Quest made no effort to retaliate.  He cowered under the attack,  holding his hands in front  of him as if to ward it off. In a  moment, Jakdane and the other  crewman had reached Asrange  and pulled him off. When they had Asrange in  irons, Jakdane turned to Quest,  who was now sitting unhappily  at the table.\n\n\n \u201cTake it easy,\u201d he advised.  \u201cI'll wake the psychosurgeon  and have him look you over. Just  stay there.\u201d\n\n\n Quest shook his head.\n\n\n \u201cDon't bother him,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt's nothing but a few bruises.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBruises? Man, that club  could have broken your skull!  Or a couple of ribs, at the very  least.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI'm all right,\u201d insisted  Quest; and when the skeptical  Jakdane insisted on examining  him carefully, he had to admit  it. There was hardly a mark on  him from the blows.\n\n\n \u201cIf it didn't hurt you any  more than that, why didn't you  take that stick away from him?\u201d  demanded Jakdane. \u201cYou could  have, easily.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI couldn't,\u201d said Quest miserably,  and turned his face  away.\n\n\n Later, alone with Trella on  the control deck, Jakdane gave  her some sober advice.\n\n\n \u201cIf you think you're in love  with Quest, forget it,\u201d he said.\n\n\n \u201cWhy? Because he's a coward?  I know that ought to make  me despise him, but it doesn't  any more.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNot because he's a coward.  Because he's an android!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat? Jakdane, you can't be  serious!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI am. I say he's an android,  an artificial imitation of a man.  It all figures.\n\n\n \u201cLook, Trella, he said he was  born on Jupiter. A human could  stand the gravity of Jupiter, inside  a dome or a ship, but what  human could stand the rocket acceleration  necessary to break  free of Jupiter? Here's a man  strong enough to break a spaceship  safety belt just by getting  up out of his chair against it,  tough enough to take a beating  with a heavy stick without being  injured. How can you believe  he's really human?\u201d\n\n\n Trella remembered the thug  Kregg striking Quest in the face  and then crying that he had injured  his hand on the bar.\n\n\n \u201cBut he said Dr. Mansard was  his father,\u201d protested Trella.\n\n\n \u201cRobots and androids frequently  look on their makers as  their parents,\u201d said Jakdane.  \u201cQuest may not even know he's  57  artificial. Do you know how  Mansard died?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThe oxygen equipment failed,  Quest said.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYes. Do you know when?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo. Quest never did tell me,  that I remember.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHe told me: a year before  Quest made his rocket flight to  Ganymede! If the oxygen equipment  failed, how do you think  Quest  lived in the poisonous atmosphere  of Jupiter, if he's human?\u201d\n\n\n Trella was silent.\n\n\n \u201cFor the protection of humans,  there are two psychological  traits built into every robot  and android,\u201d said Jakdane  gently. \u201cThe first is that they  can never, under any circumstances,  attack a human being,  even in self defense. The second  is that, while they may understand  sexual desire objectively,  they can never experience it  themselves.\n\n\n \u201cThose characteristics fit your  man Quest to a T, Trella. There  is no other explanation for him:  he must be an android.\u201d Trella did not want to believe  Jakdane was right, but his reasoning  was unassailable. Looking  upon Quest as an android,  many things were explained: his  great strength, his short, broad  build, his immunity to injury,  his refusal to defend himself  against a human, his inability to  return Trella's love for him.\n\n\n It was not inconceivable that  she should have unknowingly  fallen in love with an android.  Humans could love androids,  with real affection, even knowing  that they were artificial.  There were instances of android  nursemaids who were virtually  members of the families owning  them.\n\n\n She was glad now that she  had not told Quest of her mission  to Ganymede. He thought  he was Dr. Mansard's son, but  an android had no legal right of  inheritance from his owner. She  would leave it to Dom Blessing  to decide what to do about Quest.\n\n\n Thus she did not, as she had  intended originally, speak to  Quest about seeing him again  after she had completed her assignment.  Even if Jakdane was  wrong and Quest was human\u2014as  now seemed unlikely\u2014Quest  had told her he could not love  her. Her best course was to try  to forget him.\n\n\n Nor did Quest try to arrange  with her for a later meeting.\n\n\n \u201cIt has been pleasant knowing  you, Trella,\u201d he said when they  left the G-boat at White Sands.  A faraway look came into his  blue eyes, and he added: \u201cI'm  sorry things couldn't have been  different, somehow.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cLet's don't be sorry for what  we can't help,\u201d she said gently,  taking his hand in farewell.\n\n\n Trella took a fast plane from  White Sands, and twenty-four  hours later walked up the front  steps of the familiar brownstone  house on the outskirts of Washington.\n\n\n Dom Blessing himself met her  at the door, a stooped, graying  58  man who peered at her over his  spectacles.\n\n\n \u201cYou have the papers, eh?\u201d  he said, spying the brief case.  \u201cGood, good. Come in and we'll  see what we have, eh?\u201d\n\n\n She accompanied him through  the bare, windowless anteroom  which had always seemed to her  such a strange feature of this  luxurious house, and they entered  the big living room. They sat  before a fire in the old-fashioned  fireplace and Blessing opened the  brief case with trembling hands.\n\n\n \u201cThere are things here,\u201d he  said, his eyes sparkling as he  glanced through the notebooks.  \u201cYes, there are things here. We  shall make something of these,  Miss Trella, eh?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI'm glad they're something  you can use, Mr. Blessing,\u201d she  said. \u201cThere's something else I  found on my trip, that I think  I should tell you about.\u201d\n\n\n She told him about Quest.\n\n\n \u201cHe thinks he's the son of Dr.  Mansard,\u201d she finished, \u201cbut apparently  he is, without knowing  it, an android Dr. Mansard built  on Jupiter.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHe came back to Earth with  you, eh?\u201d asked Blessing intently.\n\n\n \u201cYes. I'm afraid it's your decision  whether to let him go on  living as a man or to tell him  he's an android and claim ownership  as Dr. Mansard's heir.\u201d\n\n\n Trella planned to spend a few  days resting in her employer's  spacious home, and then to take  a short vacation before resuming  her duties as his confidential  secretary. The next morning  when she came down from her  room, a change had been made.\n\n\n Two armed men were with  Dom Blessing at breakfast and  accompanied him wherever he  went. She discovered that two  more men with guns were stationed  in the bare anteroom and  a guard was stationed at every  entrance to the house.\n\n\n \u201cWhy all the protection?\u201d she  asked Blessing.\n\n\n \u201cA wealthy man must be careful,\u201d  said Blessing cheerfully.  \u201cWhen we don't understand all  the implications of new circumstances,  we must be prepared for  anything, eh?\u201d\n\n\n There was only one new circumstance  Trella could think  of. Without actually intending  to, she exclaimed:\n\n\n \u201cYou aren't afraid of Quest?  Why, an android can't hurt a  human!\u201d\n\n\n Blessing peered at her over his  spectacles.\n\n\n \u201cAnd what if he isn't an android,  eh? And if he is\u2014what if  old Mansard didn't build in the  prohibition against harming humans  that's required by law?  What about that, eh?\u201d\n\n\n Trella was silent, shocked.  There was something here she  hadn't known about, hadn't even  suspected. For some reason, Dom  Blessing feared Dr. Eriklund  Mansard \u2026 or his heir \u2026 or  his mechanical servant. She was sure that Blessing  was wrong, that Quest, whether  man or android, intended no  59  harm to him. Surely, Quest  would have said something of  such bitterness during their long  time together on Ganymede and  aspace, since he did not know of  Trella's connection with Blessing.  But, since this was to be  the atmosphere of Blessing's  house, she was glad that he decided  to assign her to take the  Mansard papers to the New  York laboratory.\n\n\n Quest came the day before she  was scheduled to leave.\n\n\n Trella was in the living room  with Blessing, discussing the instructions  she was to give to the  laboratory officials in New York.  The two bodyguards were with  them. The other guards were at  their posts.\n\n\n Trella heard the doorbell ring.  The heavy oaken front door was  kept locked now, and the guards  in the anteroom examined callers  through a tiny window.\n\n\n Suddenly alarm bells rang all  over the house. There was a terrific  crash outside the room as  the front door splintered. There  were shouts and the sound of a  shot.\n\n\n \u201cThe steel doors!\u201d cried Blessing,  turning white. \u201cLet's get  out of here.\u201d\n\n\n He and his bodyguards ran  through the back of the house  out of the garage.\n\n\n Blessing, ahead of the rest,  leaped into one of the cars and  started the engine.\n\n\n The door from the house shattered  and Quest burst through.  The two guards turned and fired  together.\n\n\n He could be hurt by bullets.  He was staggered momentarily.\n\n\n Then, in a blur of motion, he  sprang forward and swept the  guards aside with one hand with  such force that they skidded  across the floor and lay in an  unconscious heap against the  rear of the garage. Trella had  opened the door of the car, but  it was wrenched from her hand  as Blessing stepped on the accelerator  and it leaped into the  driveway with spinning wheels.\n\n\n Quest was after it, like a  chunky deer, running faster  than Trella had ever seen a man  run before.\n\n\n Blessing slowed for the turn  at the end of the driveway and  glanced back over his shoulder.  Seeing Quest almost upon him,  he slammed down the accelerator  and twisted the wheel hard.\n\n\n The car whipped into the  street, careened, and rolled over  and over, bringing up against a  tree on the other side in a twisted  tangle of wreckage.\n\n\n With a horrified gasp, Trella  ran down the driveway toward  the smoking heap of metal.  Quest was already beside it,  probing it. As she reached his  side, he lifted the torn body of  Dom Blessing. Blessing was  dead.\n\n\n \u201cI'm lucky,\u201d said Quest soberly.  \u201cI would have murdered  him.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut why, Quest? I knew he  was afraid of you, but he didn't  tell me why.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt was conditioned into me,\u201d  answered Quest \u201cI didn't know  60  it until just now, when it ended,  but my father conditioned me  psychologically from my birth  to the task of hunting down  Dom Blessing and killing him. It  was an unconscious drive in me  that wouldn't release me until  the task was finished.\n\n\n \u201cYou see, Blessing was my father's  assistant on Ganymede.  Right after my father completed  development of the surgiscope,  he and my mother blasted off for  Io. Blessing wanted the valuable  rights to the surgiscope, and he  sabotaged the ship's drive so it  would fall into Jupiter.\n\n\n \u201cBut my father was able to  control it in the heavy atmosphere  of Jupiter, and landed it  successfully. I was born there,  and he conditioned me to come  to Earth and track down Blessing.  I know now that it was  part of the conditioning that I  was unable to fight any other  man until my task was finished:  it might have gotten me in trouble  and diverted me from that  purpose.\u201d\n\n\n More gently than Trella would  have believed possible for his  Jupiter-strong muscles, Quest  took her in his arms.\n\n\n \u201cNow I can say I love you,\u201d  he said. \u201cThat was part of the  conditioning too: I couldn't love  any woman until my job was  done.\u201d\n\n\n Trella disengaged herself.\n\n\n \u201cI'm sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cDon't  you know this, too, now: that  you're not a man, but an android?\u201d\n\n\n He looked at her in astonishment,  stunned by her words.\n\n\n \u201cWhat in space makes you  think that?\u201d he demanded.\n\n\n \u201cWhy, Quest, it's obvious,\u201d  she cried, tears in her eyes.  \u201cEverything about you \u2026 your  build, suited for Jupiter's gravity \u2026  your strength \u2026 the  fact that you were able to live  in Jupiter's atmosphere after  the oxygen equipment failed.  I know you think Dr. Mansard  was your father, but androids  often believe that.\u201d\n\n\n He grinned at her.\n\n\n \u201cI'm no android,\u201d he said confidently.  \u201cDo you forget my father  was inventor of the surgiscope?  He knew I'd have to grow  up on Jupiter, and he operated  on the genes before I was born.  He altered my inherited characteristics  to adapt me to the climate  of Jupiter \u2026 even to  being able to breathe a chlorine  atmosphere as well as an oxygen  atmosphere.\u201d\n\n\n Trella looked at him. He was  not badly hurt, any more than  an elephant would have been,  but his tunic was stained with  red blood where the bullets had  struck him. Normal android  blood was green.\n\n\n \u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d she  asked doubtfully.\n\n\n \u201cAndroids are made,\u201d he answered  with a laugh. \u201cThey  don't grow up. And I remember  my boyhood on Jupiter very  well.\u201d\n\n\n He took her in his arms again,  and this time she did not resist.  His lips were very human.
