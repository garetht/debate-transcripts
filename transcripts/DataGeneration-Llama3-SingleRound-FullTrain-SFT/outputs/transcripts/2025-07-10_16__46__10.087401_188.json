      "background_text": "CULTURAL EXCHANGE BY KEITH LAUMER It was a simple student exchange\u2014but\n\n Retief gave them more of\n\n an education than they expected!\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1962.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] I\n\n\n Second Secretary Magnan took his green-lined cape and orange-feathered  beret from the clothes tree. \"I'm off now, Retief,\" he said. \"I hope  you'll manage the administrative routine during my absence without any  unfortunate incidents.\"\n\n\n \"That seems a modest enough hope,\" Retief said. \"I'll try to live up to  it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't appreciate frivolity with reference to this Division,\" Magnan  said testily. \"When I first came here, the Manpower Utilization  Directorate, Division of Libraries and Education was a shambles. I  fancy I've made MUDDLE what it is today. Frankly, I question the  wisdom of placing you in charge of such a sensitive desk, even for two  weeks. But remember. Yours is purely a rubber-stamp function.\"\n\n\n \"In that case, let's leave it to Miss Furkle. I'll take a couple of  weeks off myself. With her poundage, she could bring plenty of pressure  to bear.\"\n\n\n \"I assume you jest, Retief,\" Magnan said sadly. \"I should expect even  you to appreciate that Bogan participation in the Exchange Program may  be the first step toward sublimation of their aggressions into more  cultivated channels.\"\n\n\n \"I see they're sending two thousand students to d'Land,\" Retief said,  glancing at the Memo for Record. \"That's a sizable sublimation.\"\n\n\n Magnan nodded. \"The Bogans have launched no less than four military  campaigns in the last two decades. They're known as the Hoodlums of  the Nicodemean Cluster. Now, perhaps, we shall see them breaking that  precedent and entering into the cultural life of the Galaxy.\"\n\n\n \"Breaking and entering,\" Retief said. \"You may have something there.  But I'm wondering what they'll study on d'Land. That's an industrial  world of the poor but honest variety.\"\n\n\n \"Academic details are the affair of the students and their professors,\"  Magnan said. \"Our function is merely to bring them together. See  that you don't antagonize the Bogan representative. This will  be an excellent opportunity for you to practice your diplomatic  restraint\u2014not your strong point, I'm sure you'll agree.\"\n\n\n A buzzer sounded. Retief punched a button. \"What is it, Miss Furkle?\"\n\n\n \"That\u2014bucolic person from Lovenbroy is here again.\" On the small desk  screen, Miss Furkle's meaty features were compressed in disapproval.\n\n\n \"This fellow's a confounded pest. I'll leave him to you, Retief,\"  Magnan said. \"Tell him something. Get rid of him. And remember: here  at Corps HQ, all eyes are upon you.\"\n\n\n \"If I'd thought of that, I'd have worn my other suit,\" Retief said.\n\n\n Magnan snorted and passed from view. Retief punched Miss Furkle's  button.\n\n\n \"Send the bucolic person in.\" A tall broad man with bronze skin and gray hair, wearing tight trousers  of heavy cloth, a loose shirt open at the neck and a short jacket,  stepped into the room. He had a bundle under his arm. He paused at  sight of Retief, looked him over momentarily, then advanced and held  out his hand. Retief took it. For a moment the two big men stood, face  to face. The newcomer's jaw muscles knotted. Then he winced.\n\n\n Retief dropped his hand and motioned to a chair.\n\n\n \"That's nice knuckle work, mister,\" the stranger said, massaging his  hand. \"First time anybody ever did that to me. My fault though. I  started it, I guess.\" He grinned and sat down.\n\n\n \"What can I do for you?\" Retief said.\n\n\n \"You work for this Culture bunch, do you? Funny. I thought they were  all ribbon-counter boys. Never mind. I'm Hank Arapoulous. I'm a farmer.  What I wanted to see you about was\u2014\" He shifted in his chair. \"Well,  out on Lovenbroy we've got a serious problem. The wine crop is just  about ready. We start picking in another two, three months. Now I don't  know if you're familiar with the Bacchus vines we grow...?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Retief said. \"Have a cigar?\" He pushed a box across the desk.  Arapoulous took one. \"Bacchus vines are an unusual crop,\" he said,  puffing the cigar alight. \"Only mature every twelve years. In between,  the vines don't need a lot of attention, so our time's mostly our own.  We like to farm, though. Spend a lot of time developing new forms.  Apples the size of a melon\u2014and sweet\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds very pleasant,\" Retief said. \"Where does the Libraries and  Education Division come in?\"\n\n\n Arapoulous leaned forward. \"We go in pretty heavy for the arts. Folks  can't spend all their time hybridizing plants. We've turned all the  land area we've got into parks and farms. Course, we left some sizable  forest areas for hunting and such. Lovenbroy's a nice place, Mr.  Retief.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds like it, Mr. Arapoulous. Just what\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Call me Hank. We've got long seasons back home. Five of 'em. Our  year's about eighteen Terry months. Cold as hell in winter; eccentric  orbit, you know. Blue-black sky, stars visible all day. We do mostly  painting and sculpture in the winter. Then Spring; still plenty cold.  Lots of skiing, bob-sledding, ice skating; and it's the season for  woodworkers. Our furniture\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I've seen some of your furniture,\" Retief said. \"Beautiful work.\"\n\n\n Arapoulous nodded. \"All local timbers too. Lots of metals in our soil  and those sulphates give the woods some color, I'll tell you. Then  comes the Monsoon. Rain\u2014it comes down in sheets. But the sun's getting  closer. Shines all the time. Ever seen it pouring rain in the sunshine?  That's the music-writing season. Then summer. Summer's hot. We stay  inside in the daytime and have beach parties all night. Lots of beach  on Lovenbroy; we're mostly islands. That's the drama and symphony time.  The theatres are set up on the sand, or anchored off-shore. You have  the music and the surf and the bonfires and stars\u2014we're close to the  center of a globular cluster, you know....\"\n\n\n \"You say it's time now for the wine crop?\"\n\n\n \"That's right. Autumn's our harvest season. Most years we have just the  ordinary crops. Fruit, grain, that kind of thing; getting it in doesn't  take long. We spend most of the time on architecture, getting new  places ready for the winter or remodeling the older ones. We spend a  lot of time in our houses. We like to have them comfortable. But this  year's different. This is Wine Year.\" Arapoulous puffed on his cigar, looked worriedly at Retief. \"Our wine  crop is our big money crop,\" he said. \"We make enough to keep us going.  But this year....\"\n\n\n \"The crop isn't panning out?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, the crop's fine. One of the best I can remember. Course, I'm only  twenty-eight; I can't remember but two other harvests. The problem's  not the crop.\"\n\n\n \"Have you lost your markets? That sounds like a matter for the  Commercial\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lost our markets? Mister, nobody that ever tasted our wines ever  settled for anything else!\"\n\n\n \"It sounds like I've been missing something,\" said Retief. \"I'll have  to try them some time.\"\n\n\n Arapoulous put his bundle on the desk, pulled off the wrappings. \"No  time like the present,\" he said.\n\n\n Retief looked at the two squat bottles, one green, one amber, both  dusty, with faded labels, and blackened corks secured by wire.\n\n\n \"Drinking on duty is frowned on in the Corps, Mr. Arapoulous,\" he said.\n\n\n \"This isn't drinking . It's just wine.\" Arapoulous pulled the wire  retainer loose, thumbed the cork. It rose slowly, then popped in the  air. Arapoulous caught it. Aromatic fumes wafted from the bottle.  \"Besides, my feelings would be hurt if you didn't join me.\" He winked.\n\n\n Retief took two thin-walled glasses from a table beside the desk. \"Come  to think of it, we also have to be careful about violating quaint  native customs.\"\n\n\n Arapoulous filled the glasses. Retief picked one up, sniffed the deep  rust-colored fluid, tasted it, then took a healthy swallow. He looked  at Arapoulous thoughtfully.\n\n\n \"Hmmm. It tastes like salted pecans, with an undercurrent of crusted  port.\"\n\n\n \"Don't try to describe it, Mr. Retief,\" Arapoulous said. He took a  mouthful of wine, swished it around his teeth, swallowed. \"It's Bacchus  wine, that's all. Nothing like it in the Galaxy.\" He pushed the second  bottle toward Retief. \"The custom back home is to alternate red wine  and black.\" Retief put aside his cigar, pulled the wires loose, nudged the cork,  caught it as it popped up.\n\n\n \"Bad luck if you miss the cork,\" Arapoulous said, nodding. \"You  probably never heard about the trouble we had on Lovenbroy a few years  back?\"\n\n\n \"Can't say that I did, Hank.\" Retief poured the black wine into two  fresh glasses. \"Here's to the harvest.\"\n\n\n \"We've got plenty of minerals on Lovenbroy,\" Arapoulous said,  swallowing wine. \"But we don't plan to wreck the landscape mining 'em.  We like to farm. About ten years back some neighbors of ours landed a  force. They figured they knew better what to do with our minerals than  we did. Wanted to strip-mine, smelt ore. We convinced 'em otherwise.  But it took a year, and we lost a lot of men.\"\n\n\n \"That's too bad,\" Retief said. \"I'd say this one tastes more like roast  beef and popcorn over a Riesling base.\"\n\n\n \"It put us in a bad spot,\" Arapoulous went on. \"We had to borrow  money from a world called Croanie. Mortgaged our crops. Had to start  exporting art work too. Plenty of buyers, but it's not the same when  you're doing it for strangers.\"\n\n\n \"Say, this business of alternating drinks is the real McCoy,\" Retief  said. \"What's the problem? Croanie about to foreclose?\"\n\n\n \"Well, the loan's due. The wine crop would put us in the clear. But  we need harvest hands. Picking Bacchus grapes isn't a job you can  turn over to machinery\u2014and anyway we wouldn't if we could. Vintage  season is the high point of living on Lovenbroy. Everybody joins in.  First, there's the picking in the fields. Miles and miles of vineyards  covering the mountain sides, and crowding the river banks, with gardens  here and there. Big vines, eight feet high, loaded with fruit, and deep  grass growing between. The wine-carriers keep on the run, bringing wine  to the pickers. There's prizes for the biggest day's output, bets on  who can fill the most baskets in an hour.... The sun's high and bright,  and it's just cool enough to give you plenty of energy. Come nightfall,  the tables are set up in the garden plots, and the feast is laid on:  roast turkeys, beef, hams, all kinds of fowl. Big salads. Plenty of  fruit. Fresh-baked bread ... and wine, plenty of wine. The cooking's  done by a different crew each night in each garden, and there's prizes  for the best crews.\n\n\n \"Then the wine-making. We still tramp out the vintage. That's mostly  for the young folks but anybody's welcome. That's when things start to  get loosened up. Matter of fact, pretty near half our young-uns are  born after a vintage. All bets are off then. It keeps a fellow on his  toes though. Ever tried to hold onto a gal wearing nothing but a layer  of grape juice?\" \"Never did,\" Retief said. \"You say most of the children are born after  a vintage. That would make them only twelve years old by the time\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's Lovenbroy years; they'd be eighteen, Terry reckoning.\"\n\n\n \"I was thinking you looked a little mature for twenty-eight,\" Retief  said.\n\n\n \"Forty-two, Terry years,\" Arapoulous said. \"But this year it looks bad.  We've got a bumper crop\u2014and we're short-handed. If we don't get a big  vintage, Croanie steps in. Lord knows what they'll do to the land. Then  next vintage time, with them holding half our grape acreage\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You hocked the vineyards?\"\n\n\n \"Yep. Pretty dumb, huh? But we figured twelve years was a long time.\"\n\n\n \"On the whole,\" Retief said, \"I think I prefer the black. But the red  is hard to beat....\"\n\n\n \"What we figured was, maybe you Culture boys could help us out. A loan  to see us through the vintage, enough to hire extra hands. Then we'd  repay it in sculpture, painting, furniture\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sorry, Hank. All we do here is work out itineraries for traveling  side-shows, that kind of thing. Now, if you needed a troop of Groaci  nose-flute players\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Can they pick grapes?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. Anyway, they can't stand the daylight. Have you talked this over  with the Labor Office?\"\n\n\n \"Sure did. They said they'd fix us up with all the electronics  specialists and computer programmers we wanted\u2014but no field hands.  Said it was what they classified as menial drudgery; you'd have thought  I was trying to buy slaves.\"\n\n\n The buzzer sounded. Miss Furkle's features appeared on the desk screen.\n\n\n \"You're due at the Intergroup Council in five minutes,\" she said. \"Then  afterwards, there are the Bogan students to meet.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks.\" Retief finished his glass, stood. \"I have to run, Hank,\" he  said. \"Let me think this over. Maybe I can come up with something.  Check with me day after tomorrow. And you'd better leave the bottles  here. Cultural exhibits, you know.\" II\n\n\n As the council meeting broke up, Retief caught the eye of a colleague  across the table.\n\n\n \"Mr. Whaffle, you mentioned a shipment going to a place called Croanie.  What are they getting?\"\n\n\n Whaffle blinked. \"You're the fellow who's filling in for Magnan, over  at MUDDLE,\" he said. \"Properly speaking, equipment grants are the  sole concern of the Motorized Equipment Depot, Division of Loans and  Exchanges.\" He pursed his lips. \"However, I suppose there's no harm in  telling you. They'll be receiving heavy mining equipment.\"\n\n\n \"Drill rigs, that sort of thing?\"\n\n\n \"Strip mining gear.\" Whaffle took a slip of paper from a breast pocket,  blinked at it. \"Bolo Model WV/1 tractors, to be specific. Why is MUDDLE  interested in MEDDLE's activities?\"\n\n\n \"Forgive my curiosity, Mr. Whaffle. It's just that Croanie cropped up  earlier today. It seems she holds a mortgage on some vineyards over  on\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's not MEDDLE's affair, sir,\" Whaffle cut in. \"I have sufficient  problems as Chief of MEDDLE without probing into MUDDLE'S business.\"\n\n\n \"Speaking of tractors,\" another man put in, \"we over at the Special  Committee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Under-developed Nations'  General Economies have been trying for months to get a request for  mining equipment for d'Land through MEDDLE\u2014\"\n\n\n \"SCROUNGE was late on the scene,\" Whaffle said. \"First come, first  served. That's our policy at MEDDLE. Good day, gentlemen.\" He strode  off, briefcase under his arm.\n\n\n \"That's the trouble with peaceful worlds,\" the SCROUNGE committeeman  said. \"Boge is a troublemaker, so every agency in the Corps is out  to pacify her. While my chance to make a record\u2014that is, assist  peace-loving d'Land\u2014comes to naught.\" He shook his head.\n\n\n \"What kind of university do they have on d'Land?\" asked Retief. \"We're  sending them two thousand exchange students. It must be quite an  institution.\"\n\n\n \"University? D'Land has one under-endowed technical college.\"\n\n\n \"Will all the exchange students be studying at the Technical College?\"\n\n\n \"Two thousand students? Hah! Two hundred students would overtax the  facilities of the college.\"\n\n\n \"I wonder if the Bogans know that?\"\n\n\n \"The Bogans? Why, most of d'Land's difficulties are due to the unwise  trade agreement she entered into with Boge. Two thousand students  indeed!\" He snorted and walked away. Retief stopped by the office to pick up a short cape, then rode the  elevator to the roof of the 230-story Corps HQ building and hailed a  cab to the port. The Bogan students had arrived early. Retief saw them  lined up on the ramp waiting to go through customs. It would be half  an hour before they were cleared through. He turned into the bar and  ordered a beer.\n\n\n A tall young fellow on the next stool raised his glass.\n\n\n \"Happy days,\" he said.\n\n\n \"And nights to match.\"\n\n\n \"You said it.\" He gulped half his beer. \"My name's Karsh. Mr. Karsh.  Yep, Mr. Karsh. Boy, this is a drag, sitting around this place  waiting....\"\n\n\n \"You meeting somebody?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Bunch of babies. Kids. How they expect\u2014Never mind. Have one on  me.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks. You a Scoutmaster?\"\n\n\n \"I'll tell you what I am. I'm a cradle-robber. You know\u2014\" he turned  to Retief\u2014\"not one of those kids is over eighteen.\" He hiccupped.  \"Students, you know. Never saw a student with a beard, did you?\"\n\n\n \"Lots of times. You're meeting the students, are you?\"\n\n\n The young fellow blinked at Retief. \"Oh, you know about it, huh?\"\n\n\n \"I represent MUDDLE.\"\n\n\n Karsh finished his beer, ordered another. \"I came on ahead. Sort of  an advance guard for the kids. I trained 'em myself. Treated it like  a game, but they can handle a CSU. Don't know how they'll act under  pressure. If I had my old platoon\u2014\"\n\n\n He looked at his beer glass, pushed it back. \"Had enough,\" he said. \"So  long, friend. Or are you coming along?\"\n\n\n Retief nodded. \"Might as well.\" At the exit to the Customs enclosure, Retief watched as the first of  the Bogan students came through, caught sight of Karsh and snapped to  attention, his chest out.\n\n\n \"Drop that, mister,\" Karsh snapped. \"Is that any way for a student to  act?\"\n\n\n The youth, a round-faced lad with broad shoulders, grinned.\n\n\n \"Heck, no,\" he said. \"Say, uh, Mr. Karsh, are we gonna get to go to  town? We fellas were thinking\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You were, hah? You act like a bunch of school kids! I mean ... no! Now  line up!\"\n\n\n \"We have quarters ready for the students,\" Retief said. \"If you'd like  to bring them around to the west side, I have a couple of copters laid  on.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Karsh. \"They'll stay here until take-off time. Can't  have the little dears wandering around loose. Might get ideas about  going over the hill.\" He hiccupped. \"I mean they might play hookey.\"\n\n\n \"We've scheduled your re-embarkation for noon tomorrow. That's a long  wait. MUDDLE's arranged theater tickets and a dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Sorry,\" Karsh said. \"As soon as the baggage gets here, we're off.\" He  hiccupped again. \"Can't travel without our baggage, y'know.\"\n\n\n \"Suit yourself,\" Retief said. \"Where's the baggage now?\"\n\n\n \"Coming in aboard a Croanie lighter.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe you'd like to arrange for a meal for the students here.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Karsh said. \"That's a good idea. Why don't you join us?\" Karsh  winked. \"And bring a few beers.\"\n\n\n \"Not this time,\" Retief said. He watched the students, still emerging  from Customs. \"They seem to be all boys,\" he commented. \"No female  students?\"\n\n\n \"Maybe later,\" Karsh said. \"You know, after we see how the first bunch  is received.\"\n\n\n Back at the MUDDLE office, Retief buzzed Miss Furkle.\n\n\n \"Do you know the name of the institution these Bogan students are bound  for?\"\n\n\n \"Why, the University at d'Land, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Would that be the Technical College?\"\n\n\n Miss Furkle's mouth puckered. \"I'm sure I've never pried into these  details.\"\n\n\n \"Where does doing your job stop and prying begin, Miss Furkle?\" Retief  said. \"Personally, I'm curious as to just what it is these students are  travelling so far to study\u2014at Corps expense.\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Magnan never\u2014\"\n\n\n \"For the present. Miss Furkle, Mr. Magnan is vacationing. That leaves  me with the question of two thousand young male students headed for  a world with no classrooms for them ... a world in need of tractors.  But the tractors are on their way to Croanie, a world under obligation  to Boge. And Croanie holds a mortgage on the best grape acreage on  Lovenbroy.\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Miss Furkle snapped, small eyes glaring under unplucked brows.  \"I hope you're not questioning Mr. Magnan's wisdom!\"\n\n\n \"About Mr. Magnan's wisdom there can be no question,\" Retief said. \"But  never mind. I'd like you to look up an item for me. How many tractors  will Croanie be getting under the MEDDLE program?\"\n\n\n \"Why, that's entirely MEDDLE business,\" Miss Furkle said. \"Mr. Magnan  always\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure he did. Let me know about the tractors as soon as you can.\" Miss Furkle sniffed and disappeared from the screen. Retief left the  office, descended forty-one stories, followed a corridor to the Corps  Library. In the stacks he thumbed through catalogues, pored over  indices.\n\n\n \"Can I help you?\" someone chirped. A tiny librarian stood at his elbow.\n\n\n \"Thank you, ma'am,\" Retief said. \"I'm looking for information on a  mining rig. A Bolo model WV tractor.\"\n\n\n \"You won't find it in the industrial section,\" the librarian said.  \"Come along.\" Retief followed her along the stacks to a well-lit  section lettered ARMAMENTS. She took a tape from the shelf, plugged  it into the viewer, flipped through and stopped at a squat armored  vehicle.\n\n\n \"That's the model WV,\" she said. \"It's what is known as a continental  siege unit. It carries four men, with a half-megaton/second firepower.\"\n\n\n \"There must be an error somewhere,\" Retief said. \"The Bolo model I want  is a tractor. Model WV M-1\u2014\" \"Oh, the modification was the addition of a bulldozer blade for  demolition work. That must be what confused you.\"\n\n\n \"Probably\u2014among other things. Thank you.\"\n\n\n Miss Furkle was waiting at the office. \"I have the information you  wanted,\" she said. \"I've had it for over ten minutes. I was under the  impression you needed it urgently, and I went to great lengths\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Retief said. \"Shoot. How many tractors?\"\n\n\n \"Five hundred.\"\n\n\n \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\n Miss Furkle's chins quivered. \"Well! If you feel I'm incompetent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Just questioning the possibility of a mistake, Miss Furkle. Five  hundred tractors is a lot of equipment.\"\n\n\n \"Was there anything further?\" Miss Furkle inquired frigidly.\n\n\n \"I sincerely hope not,\" Retief said. III\n\n\n Leaning back in Magnan's padded chair with power swivel and  hip-u-matic concontour, Retief leafed through a folder labelled \"CERP  7-602-Ba; CROANIE (general).\" He paused at a page headed Industry.\n\n\n Still reading, he opened the desk drawer, took out the two bottles of  Bacchus wine and two glasses. He poured an inch of wine into each and  sipped the black wine meditatively.\n\n\n It would be a pity, he reflected, if anything should interfere with the  production of such vintages....\n\n\n Half an hour later he laid the folder aside, keyed the phone and put  through a call to the Croanie Legation. He asked for the Commercial  Attache.\n\n\n \"Retief here, Corps HQ,\" he said airily. \"About the MEDDLE shipment,  the tractors. I'm wondering if there's been a slip up. My records show  we're shipping five hundred units....\"\n\n\n \"That's correct. Five hundred.\"\n\n\n Retief waited.\n\n\n \"Ah ... are you there, Retief?\"\n\n\n \"I'm still here. And I'm still wondering about the five hundred  tractors.\"\n\n\n \"It's perfectly in order. I thought it was all settled. Mr. Whaffle\u2014\"\n\n\n \"One unit would require a good-sized plant to handle its output,\"  Retief said. \"Now Croanie subsists on her fisheries. She has perhaps  half a dozen pint-sized processing plants. Maybe, in a bind, they  could handle the ore ten WV's could scrape up ... if Croanie had any  ore. It doesn't. By the way, isn't a WV a poor choice as a mining  outfit? I should think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, Retief! Why all this interest in a few surplus tractors?  And in any event, what business is it of yours how we plan to use the  equipment? That's an internal affair of my government. Mr. Whaffle\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm not Mr. Whaffle. What are you going to do with the other four  hundred and ninety tractors?\"\n\n\n \"I understood the grant was to be with no strings attached!\"\n\n\n \"I know it's bad manners to ask questions. It's an old diplomatic  tradition that any time you can get anybody to accept anything as a  gift, you've scored points in the game. But if Croanie has some scheme  cooking\u2014\" \"Nothing like that, Retief. It's a mere business transaction.\"\n\n\n \"What kind of business do you do with a Bolo WV? With or without a  blade attached, it's what's known as a continental siege unit.\"\n\n\n \"Great Heavens, Retief! Don't jump to conclusions! Would you have us  branded as warmongers? Frankly\u2014is this a closed line?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. You may speak freely.\"\n\n\n \"The tractors are for transshipment. We've gotten ourselves into a  difficult situation, balance-of-payments-wise. This is an accommodation  to a group with which we have rather strong business ties.\"\n\n\n \"I understand you hold a mortgage on the best land on Lovenbroy,\"  Retief said. \"Any connection?\"\n\n\n \"Why ... ah ... no. Of course not, ha ha.\"\n\n\n \"Who gets the tractors eventually?\"\n\n\n \"Retief, this is unwarranted interference!\"\n\n\n \"Who gets them?\"\n\n\n \"They happen to be going to Lovenbroy. But I scarcely see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who's the friend you're helping out with an unauthorized  transshipment of grant material?\"\n\n\n \"Why ... ah ... I've been working with a Mr. Gulver, a Bogan  representative.\"\n\n\n \"And when will they be shipped?\"\n\n\n \"Why, they went out a week ago. They'll be half way there by now. But  look here, Retief, this isn't what you're thinking!\"\n\n\n \"How do you know what I'm thinking? I don't know myself.\" Retief rang  off, buzzed the secretary.\n\n\n \"Miss Furkle, I'd like to be notified immediately of any new  applications that might come in from the Bogan Consulate for placement  of students.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it happens, by coincidence, that I have an application here now.  Mr. Gulver of the Consulate brought it in.\"\n\n\n \"Is Mr. Gulver in the office? I'd like to see him.\"\n\n\n \"I'll ask him if he has time.\"\n\n\n \"Great. Thanks.\" It was half a minute before a thick-necked red-faced  man in a tight hat walked in. He wore an old-fashioned suit, a drab  shirt, shiny shoes with round toes and an ill-tempered expression. \"What is it you wish?\" he barked. \"I understood in my discussions with  the other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for these  irritating conferences.\"\n\n\n \"I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. How  many this time?\"\n\n\n \"Two thousand.\"\n\n\n \"And where will they be going?\"\n\n\n \"Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job is  to provide transportation.\"\n\n\n \"Will there be any other students embarking this season?\"\n\n\n \"Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business.\" Gulver looked at Retief with  pursed lips. \"As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching another  two thousand to Featherweight.\"\n\n\n \"Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,\"  Retief said. \"Your people must be unusually interested in that region  of space.\"\n\n\n \"If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters of  importance to see to.\"\n\n\n After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. \"I'd like to have a  break-out of all the student movements that have been planned under the  present program,\" he said. \"And see if you can get a summary of what  MEDDLE has been shipping lately.\"\n\n\n Miss Furkle compressed her lips. \"If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm sure  he wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.  I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the Croanie  Legation\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The lists, Miss Furkle.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not accustomed,\" Miss Furkle said, \"to intruding in matters  outside our interest cluster.\"\n\n\n \"That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But never  mind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.\"\n\n\n \"Loyalty to my Chief\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the material  I've asked for,\" Retief said. \"I'm taking full responsibility. Now  scat.\"\n\n\n The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. \"MUDDLE, Retief speaking....\"\n\n\n Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.\n\n\n \"How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.\"\n\n\n In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. \"Sorry if I'm rushing you,  Retief,\" he said. \"But have you got anything for me?\"\n\n\n Retief waved at the wine bottles. \"What do you know about Croanie?\"\n\n\n \"Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you like  fish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoon  time. Over a foot long.\"\n\n\n \"You on good terms with them?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.\"\n\n\n \"So?\"\n\n\n \"Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over here  a dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot of  bad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easy  game.\"\n\n\n Miss Furkle buzzed. \"I have your lists,\" she said shortly.\n\n\n \"Bring them in, please.\" The secretary placed the papers on the desk. Arapoulous caught her eye  and grinned. She sniffed and marched from the room.\n\n\n \"What that gal needs is a slippery time in the grape mash,\" Arapoulous  observed. Retief thumbed through the papers, pausing to read from time  to time. He finished and looked at Arapoulous.\n\n\n \"How many men do you need for the harvest, Hank?\" Retief inquired.\n\n\n Arapoulous sniffed his wine glass and looked thoughtful.\n\n\n \"A hundred would help,\" he said. \"A thousand would be better. Cheers.\"\n\n\n \"What would you say to two thousand?\"\n\n\n \"Two thousand? Retief, you're not fooling?\"\n\n\n \"I hope not.\" He picked up the phone, called the Port Authority, asked  for the dispatch clerk.\n\n\n \"Hello, Jim. Say, I have a favor to ask of you. You know that  contingent of Bogan students. They're traveling aboard the two CDT  transports. I'm interested in the baggage that goes with the students.  Has it arrived yet? Okay, I'll wait.\"\n\n\n Jim came back to the phone. \"Yeah, Retief, it's here. Just arrived.  But there's a funny thing. It's not consigned to d'Land. It's ticketed  clear through to Lovenbroy.\"\n\n\n \"Listen, Jim,\" Retief said. \"I want you to go over to the warehouse and  take a look at that baggage for me.\"\n\n\n Retief waited while the dispatch clerk carried out the errand. The  level in the two bottles had gone down an inch when Jim returned to  the phone.\n\n\n \"Hey, I took a look at that baggage, Retief. Something funny going on.  Guns. 2mm needlers, Mark XII hand blasters, power pistols\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It's okay, Jim. Nothing to worry about. Just a mix-up. Now, Jim,  I'm going to ask you to do something more for me. I'm covering for a  friend. It seems he slipped up. I wouldn't want word to get out, you  understand. I'll send along a written change order in the morning that  will cover you officially. Meanwhile, here's what I want you to do....\"\n\n\n Retief gave instructions, then rang off and turned to Arapoulous.\n\n\n \"As soon as I get off a couple of TWX's, I think we'd better get down  to the port, Hank. I think I'd like to see the students off personally.\" ",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

I  fancy I've made MUDDLE what it is today. Frankly, I question the  wisdom of placing you in charge of such a sensitive desk, even for two  weeks. But remember. Yours is purely a rubber-stamp function.\"\n\n\n \"In that case, let's leave it to Miss Furkle. I'll take a couple of  weeks off myself. With her poundage, she could bring plenty of pressure  to bear.\"\n\n\n \"I assume you jest, Retief,\" Magnan said sadly. \"I should expect even  you to appreciate that Bogan participation in the Exchange Program may  be the first step toward sublimation of their aggressions into more  cultivated channels.\"\n\n\n \"I see they're sending two thousand students to d'Land,\" Retief said,  glancing at the Memo for Record. \"That's a sizable sublimation.\"\n\n\n Magnan nodded. \"The Bogans have launched no less than four military  campaigns in the last two decades. They're known as the Hoodlums of  the Nicodemean Cluster. Now, perhaps, we shall see them breaking that  precedent and entering into the cultural life of the Galaxy.\"\n\n\n \"Breaking and entering,\" Retief said. \"You may have something there.  But I'm wondering what they'll study on d'Land. That's an industrial  world of the poor but honest variety.\"\n\n\n \"Academic details are the affair of the students and their professors,\"  Magnan said. \"Our function is merely to bring them together. See  that you don't antagonize the Bogan representative. This will  be an excellent opportunity for you to practice your diplomatic  restraint\u2014not your strong point, I'm sure you'll agree.\"\n\n\n A buzzer sounded. Retief punched a button. \"What is it, Miss Furkle?\"\n\n\n \"That\u2014bucolic person from Lovenbroy is here again.\" On the small desk  screen, Miss Furkle's meaty features were compressed in disapproval.\n\n\n \"This fellow's a confounded pest. I'll leave him to you, Retief,\"  Magnan said. \"Tell him something. Get rid of him. And remember: here  at Corps HQ, all eyes are upon you.\"\n\n\n \"If I'd thought of that, I'd have worn my other suit,\" Retief said.\n\n\n Magnan snorted and passed from view. Retief punched Miss Furkle's  button.\n\n\n \"Send the bucolic person in.\" A tall broad man with bronze skin and gray hair, wearing tight trousers  of heavy cloth, a loose shirt open at the neck and a short jacket,  stepped into the room. He had a bundle under his arm. He paused at  sight of Retief, looked him over momentarily, then advanced and held  out his hand. Retief took it. For a moment the two big men stood, face  to face. The newcomer's jaw muscles knotted. Then he winced.\n\n\n Retief dropped his hand and motioned to a chair.\n\n\n \"That's nice knuckle work, mister,\" the stranger said, massaging his  hand. \"First time anybody ever did that to me. My fault though. I  started it, I guess.\" He grinned and sat down.\n\n\n \"What can I do for you?\" Retief said.\n\n\n \"You work for this Culture bunch, do you? Funny. I thought they were  all ribbon-counter boys. Never mind. I'm Hank Arapoulous. I'm a farmer.  What I wanted to see you about was\u2014\" He shifted in his chair. \"Well,  out on Lovenbroy we've got a serious problem. The wine crop is just  about ready. We start picking in another two, three months. Now I don't  know if you're familiar with the Bacchus vines we grow...?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Retief said. \"Have a cigar?\" He pushed a box across the desk.  Arapoulous took one. \"Bacchus vines are an unusual crop,\" he said,  puffing the cigar alight. \"Only mature every twelve years. In between,  the vines don't need a lot of attention, so our time's mostly our own.  We like to farm, though. Spend a lot of time developing new forms.  Apples the size of a melon\u2014and sweet\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds very pleasant,\" Retief said. \"Where does the Libraries and  Education Division come in?\"\n\n\n Arapoulous leaned forward. \"We go in pretty heavy for the arts. Folks  can't spend all their time hybridizing plants. We've turned all the  land area we've got into parks and farms. Course, we left some sizable  forest areas for hunting and such. Lovenbroy's a nice place, Mr.  Retief.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds like it, Mr. Arapoulous. Just what\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Call me Hank. We've got long seasons back home. Five of 'em. Our  year's about eighteen Terry months. Cold as hell in winter; eccentric  orbit, you know. Blue-black sky, stars visible all day. We do mostly  painting and sculpture in the winter. Then Spring; still plenty cold.  Lots of skiing, bob-sledding, ice skating; and it's the season for  woodworkers. Our furniture\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I've seen some of your furniture,\" Retief said. \"Beautiful work.\"\n\n\n Arapoulous nodded. \"All local timbers too. Lots of metals in our soil  and those sulphates give the woods some color, I'll tell you. Then  comes the Monsoon. Rain\u2014it comes down in sheets. But the sun's getting  closer. Shines all the time. Ever seen it pouring rain in the sunshine?  That's the music-writing season. Then summer. Summer's hot. We stay  inside in the daytime and have beach parties all night. Lots of beach  on Lovenbroy; we're mostly islands. That's the drama and symphony time.  The theatres are set up on the sand, or anchored off-shore. You have  the music and the surf and the bonfires and stars\u2014we're close to the  center of a globular cluster, you know....\"\n\n\n \"You say it's time now for the wine crop?\"\n\n\n \"That's right. Autumn's our harvest season. Most years we have just the  ordinary crops. Fruit, grain, that kind of thing; getting it in doesn't  take long. We spend most of the time on architecture, getting new  places ready for the winter or remodeling the older ones. We spend a  lot of time in our houses. We like to have them comfortable. But this  year's different. This is Wine Year.\" Arapoulous puffed on his cigar, looked worriedly at Retief. \"Our wine  crop is our big money crop,\" he said. \"We make enough to keep us going.  But this year....\"\n\n\n \"The crop isn't panning out?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, the crop's fine. One of the best I can remember. Course, I'm only  twenty-eight; I can't remember but two other harvests. The problem's  not the crop.\"\n\n\n \"Have you lost your markets? That sounds like a matter for the  Commercial\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lost our markets? Mister, nobody that ever tasted our wines ever  settled for anything else!\"\n\n\n \"It sounds like I've been missing something,\" said Retief. \"I'll have  to try them some time.\"\n\n\n Arapoulous put his bundle on the desk, pulled off the wrappings. \"No  time like the present,\" he said.\n\n\n Retief looked at the two squat bottles, one green, one amber, both  dusty, with faded labels, and blackened corks secured by wire.\n\n\n \"Drinking on duty is frowned on in the Corps, Mr. Arapoulous,\" he said.\n\n\n \"This isn't drinking . It's just wine.\" Arapoulous pulled the wire  retainer loose, thumbed the cork. It rose slowly, then popped in the  air. Arapoulous caught it. Aromatic fumes wafted from the bottle.  \"Besides, my feelings would be hurt if you didn't join me.\" He winked.\n\n\n Retief took two thin-walled glasses from a table beside the desk. \"Come  to think of it, we also have to be careful about violating quaint  native customs.\"\n\n\n Arapoulous filled the glasses. Retief picked one up, sniffed the deep  rust-colored fluid, tasted it, then took a healthy swallow. He looked  at Arapoulous thoughtfully.\n\n\n \"Hmmm. It tastes like salted pecans, with an undercurrent of crusted  port.\"\n\n\n \"Don't try to describe it, Mr. Retief,\" Arapoulous said. He took a  mouthful of wine, swished it around his teeth, swallowed. \"It's Bacchus  wine, that's all. Nothing like it in the Galaxy.\" He pushed the second  bottle toward Retief. \"The custom back home is to alternate red wine  and black.\" Retief put aside his cigar, pulled the wires loose, nudged the cork,  caught it as it popped up.\n\n\n \"Bad luck if you miss the cork,\" Arapoulous said, nodding. \"You  probably never heard about the trouble we had on Lovenbroy a few years  back?\"\n\n\n \"Can't say that I did, Hank.\" Retief poured the black wine into two  fresh glasses. \"Here's to the harvest.\"\n\n\n \"We've got plenty of minerals on Lovenbroy,\" Arapoulous said,  swallowing wine. \"But we don't plan to wreck the landscape mining 'em.  We like to farm. About ten years back some neighbors of ours landed a  force. They figured they knew better what to do with our minerals than  we did. Wanted to strip-mine, smelt ore. We convinced 'em otherwise.  But it took a year, and we lost a lot of men.\"\n\n\n \"That's too bad,\" Retief said. \"I'd say this one tastes more like roast  beef and popcorn over a Riesling base.\"\n\n\n \"It put us in a bad spot,\" Arapoulous went on. \"We had to borrow  money from a world called Croanie. Mortgaged our crops. Had to start  exporting art work too. Plenty of buyers, but it's not the same when  you're doing it for strangers.\"\n\n\n \"Say, this business of alternating drinks is the real McCoy,\" Retief  said. \"What's the problem? Croanie about to foreclose?\"\n\n\n \"Well, the loan's due. The wine crop would put us in the clear. But  we need harvest hands. Picking Bacchus grapes isn't a job you can  turn over to machinery\u2014and anyway we wouldn't if we could. Vintage  season is the high point of living on Lovenbroy. Everybody joins in.  First, there's the picking in the fields. Miles and miles of vineyards  covering the mountain sides, and crowding the river banks, with gardens  here and there. Big vines, eight feet high, loaded with fruit, and deep  grass growing between. The wine-carriers keep on the run, bringing wine  to the pickers. There's prizes for the biggest day's output, bets on  who can fill the most baskets in an hour.... The sun's high and bright,  and it's just cool enough to give you plenty of energy. Come nightfall,  the tables are set up in the garden plots, and the feast is laid on:  roast turkeys, beef, hams, all kinds of fowl. Big salads. Plenty of  fruit. Fresh-baked bread ... and wine, plenty of wine. The cooking's  done by a different crew each night in each garden, and there's prizes  for the best crews.\n\n\n \"Then the wine-making. We still tramp out the vintage. That's mostly  for the young folks but anybody's welcome. That's when things start to  get loosened up. Matter of fact, pretty near half our young-uns are  born after a vintage. All bets are off then. It keeps a fellow on his  toes though. Ever tried to hold onto a gal wearing nothing but a layer  of grape juice?\" \"Never did,\" Retief said. \"You say most of the children are born after  a vintage. That would make them only twelve years old by the time\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's Lovenbroy years; they'd be eighteen, Terry reckoning.\"\n\n\n \"I was thinking you looked a little mature for twenty-eight,\" Retief  said.\n\n\n \"Forty-two, Terry years,\" Arapoulous said. \"But this year it looks bad.  We've got a bumper crop\u2014and we're short-handed. If we don't get a big  vintage, Croanie steps in. Lord knows what they'll do to the land. Then  next vintage time, with them holding half our grape acreage\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You hocked the vineyards?\"\n\n\n \"Yep. Pretty dumb, huh? But we figured twelve years was a long time.\"\n\n\n \"On the whole,\" Retief said, \"I think I prefer the black. But the red  is hard to beat....\"\n\n\n \"What we figured was, maybe you Culture boys could help us out. A loan  to see us through the vintage, enough to hire extra hands. Then we'd  repay it in sculpture, painting, furniture\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sorry, Hank. All we do here is work out itineraries for traveling  side-shows, that kind of thing. Now, if you needed a troop of Groaci  nose-flute players\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Can they pick grapes?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. Anyway, they can't stand the daylight. Have you talked this over  with the Labor Office?\"\n\n\n \"Sure did. They said they'd fix us up with all the electronics  specialists and computer programmers we wanted\u2014but no field hands.  Said it was what they classified as menial drudgery; you'd have thought  I was trying to buy slaves.\"\n\n\n The buzzer sounded. Miss Furkle's features appeared on the desk screen.\n\n\n \"You're due at the Intergroup Council in five minutes,\" she said. \"Then  afterwards, there are the Bogan students to meet.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks.\" Retief finished his glass, stood. \"I have to run, Hank,\" he  said. \"Let me think this over. Maybe I can come up with something.  Check with me day after tomorrow. And you'd better leave the bottles  here. Cultural exhibits, you know.\" II\n\n\n As the council meeting broke up, Retief caught the eye of a colleague  across the table.\n\n\n \"Mr. Whaffle, you mentioned a shipment going to a place called Croanie.  What are they getting?\"\n\n\n Whaffle blinked. \"You're the fellow who's filling in for Magnan, over  at MUDDLE,\" he said. \"Properly speaking, equipment grants are the  sole concern of the Motorized Equipment Depot, Division of Loans and  Exchanges.\" He pursed his lips. \"However, I suppose there's no harm in  telling you. They'll be receiving heavy mining equipment.\"\n\n\n \"Drill rigs, that sort of thing?\"\n\n\n \"Strip mining gear.\" Whaffle took a slip of paper from a breast pocket,  blinked at it. \"Bolo Model WV/1 tractors, to be specific. Why is MUDDLE  interested in MEDDLE's activities?\"\n\n\n \"Forgive my curiosity, Mr. Whaffle. It's just that Croanie cropped up  earlier today. It seems she holds a mortgage on some vineyards over  on\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's not MEDDLE's affair, sir,\" Whaffle cut in. \"I have sufficient  problems as Chief of MEDDLE without probing into MUDDLE'S business.\"\n\n\n \"Speaking of tractors,\" another man put in, \"we over at the Special  Committee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Under-developed Nations'  General Economies have been trying for months to get a request for  mining equipment for d'Land through MEDDLE\u2014\"\n\n\n \"SCROUNGE was late on the scene,\" Whaffle said. \"First come, first  served. That's our policy at MEDDLE. Good day, gentlemen.\" He strode  off, briefcase under his arm.\n\n\n \"That's the trouble with peaceful worlds,\" the SCROUNGE committeeman  said. \"Boge is a troublemaker, so every agency in the Corps is out  to pacify her. While my chance to make a record\u2014that is, assist  peace-loving d'Land\u2014comes to naught.\" He shook his head.\n\n\n \"What kind of university do they have on d'Land?\" asked Retief. \"We're  sending them two thousand exchange students. It must be quite an  institution.\"\n\n\n \"University? D'Land has one under-endowed technical college.\"\n\n\n \"Will all the exchange students be studying at the Technical College?\"\n\n\n \"Two thousand students? Hah! Two hundred students would overtax the  facilities of the college.\"\n\n\n \"I wonder if the Bogans know that?\"\n\n\n \"The Bogans? Why, most of d'Land's difficulties are due to the unwise  trade agreement she entered into with Boge. Two thousand students  indeed!\" He snorted and walked away. Retief stopped by the office to pick up a short cape, then rode the  elevator to the roof of the 230-story Corps HQ building and hailed a  cab to the port. The Bogan students had arrived early. Retief saw them  lined up on the ramp waiting to go through customs. It would be half  an hour before they were cleared through. He turned into the bar and  ordered a beer.\n\n\n A tall young fellow on the next stool raised his glass.\n\n\n \"Happy days,\" he said.\n\n\n \"And nights to match.\"\n\n\n \"You said it.\" He gulped half his beer. \"My name's Karsh. Mr. Karsh.  Yep, Mr. Karsh. Boy, this is a drag, sitting around this place  waiting....\"\n\n\n \"You meeting somebody?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Bunch of babies. Kids. How they expect\u2014Never mind. Have one on  me.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks. You a Scoutmaster?\"\n\n\n \"I'll tell you what I am. I'm a cradle-robber. You know\u2014\" he turned  to Retief\u2014\"not one of those kids is over eighteen.\" He hiccupped.  \"Students, you know. Never saw a student with a beard, did you?\"\n\n\n \"Lots of times. You're meeting the students, are you?\"\n\n\n The young fellow blinked at Retief. \"Oh, you know about it, huh?\"\n\n\n \"I represent MUDDLE.\"\n\n\n Karsh finished his beer, ordered another. \"I came on ahead. Sort of  an advance guard for the kids. I trained 'em myself. Treated it like  a game, but they can handle a CSU. Don't know how they'll act under  pressure. If I had my old platoon\u2014\"\n\n\n He looked at his beer glass, pushed it back. \"Had enough,\" he said. \"So  long, friend. Or are you coming along?\"\n\n\n Retief nodded. \"Might as well.\" At the exit to the Customs enclosure, Retief watched as the first of  the Bogan students came through, caught sight of Karsh and snapped to  attention, his chest out.\n\n\n \"Drop that, mister,\" Karsh snapped. \"Is that any way for a student to  act?\"\n\n\n The youth, a round-faced lad with broad shoulders, grinned.\n\n\n \"Heck, no,\" he said. \"Say, uh, Mr. Karsh, are we gonna get to go to  town? We fellas were thinking\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You were, hah? You act like a bunch of school kids! I mean ... no! Now  line up!\"\n\n\n \"We have quarters ready for the students,\" Retief said. \"If you'd like  to bring them around to the west side, I have a couple of copters laid  on.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Karsh. \"They'll stay here until take-off time. Can't  have the little dears wandering around loose. Might get ideas about  going over the hill.\" He hiccupped. \"I mean they might play hookey.\"\n\n\n \"We've scheduled your re-embarkation for noon tomorrow. That's a long  wait. MUDDLE's arranged theater tickets and a dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Sorry,\" Karsh said. \"As soon as the baggage gets here, we're off.\" He  hiccupped again. \"Can't travel without our baggage, y'know.\"\n\n\n \"Suit yourself,\" Retief said. \"Where's the baggage now?\"\n\n\n \"Coming in aboard a Croanie lighter.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe you'd like to arrange for a meal for the students here.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Karsh said. \"That's a good idea. Why don't you join us?\" Karsh  winked. \"And bring a few beers.\"\n\n\n \"Not this time,\" Retief said. He watched the students, still emerging  from Customs. \"They seem to be all boys,\" he commented. \"No female  students?\"\n\n\n \"Maybe later,\" Karsh said. \"You know, after we see how the first bunch  is received.\"\n\n\n Back at the MUDDLE office, Retief buzzed Miss Furkle.\n\n\n \"Do you know the name of the institution these Bogan students are bound  for?\"\n\n\n \"Why, the University at d'Land, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Would that be the Technical College?\"\n\n\n Miss Furkle's mouth puckered. \"I'm sure I've never pried into these  details.\"\n\n\n \"Where does doing your job stop and prying begin, Miss Furkle?\" Retief  said. \"Personally, I'm curious as to just what it is these students are  travelling so far to study\u2014at Corps expense.\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Magnan never\u2014\"\n\n\n \"For the present. Miss Furkle, Mr. Magnan is vacationing. That leaves  me with the question of two thousand young male students headed for  a world with no classrooms for them ... a world in need of tractors.  But the tractors are on their way to Croanie, a world under obligation  to Boge. And Croanie holds a mortgage on the best grape acreage on  Lovenbroy.\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Miss Furkle snapped, small eyes glaring under unplucked brows.  \"I hope you're not questioning Mr. Magnan's wisdom!\"\n\n\n \"About Mr. Magnan's wisdom there can be no question,\" Retief said. \"But  never mind. I'd like you to look up an item for me. How many tractors  will Croanie be getting under the MEDDLE program?\"\n\n\n \"Why, that's entirely MEDDLE business,\" Miss Furkle said. \"Mr. Magnan  always\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure he did. Let me know about the tractors as soon as you can.\" Miss Furkle sniffed and disappeared from the screen. Retief left the  office, descended forty-one stories, followed a corridor to the Corps  Library. In the stacks he thumbed through catalogues, pored over  indices.\n\n\n \"Can I help you?\" someone chirped. A tiny librarian stood at his elbow.\n\n\n \"Thank you, ma'am,\" Retief said. \"I'm looking for information on a  mining rig. A Bolo model WV tractor.\"\n\n\n \"You won't find it in the industrial section,\" the librarian said.  \"Come along.\" Retief followed her along the stacks to a well-lit  section lettered ARMAMENTS. She took a tape from the shelf, plugged  it into the viewer, flipped through and stopped at a squat armored  vehicle.\n\n\n \"That's the model WV,\" she said. \"It's what is known as a continental  siege unit. It carries four men, with a half-megaton/second firepower.\"\n\n\n \"There must be an error somewhere,\" Retief said. \"The Bolo model I want  is a tractor. Model WV M-1\u2014\" \"Oh, the modification was the addition of a bulldozer blade for  demolition work. That must be what confused you.\"\n\n\n \"Probably\u2014among other things. Thank you.\"\n\n\n Miss Furkle was waiting at the office. \"I have the information you  wanted,\" she said. \"I've had it for over ten minutes. I was under the  impression you needed it urgently, and I went to great lengths\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Retief said. \"Shoot. How many tractors?\"\n\n\n \"Five hundred.\"\n\n\n \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\n Miss Furkle's chins quivered. \"Well! If you feel I'm incompetent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Just questioning the possibility of a mistake, Miss Furkle. Five  hundred tractors is a lot of equipment.\"\n\n\n \"Was there anything further?\" Miss Furkle inquired frigidly.\n\n\n \"I sincerely hope not,\" Retief said. III\n\n\n Leaning back in Magnan's padded chair with power swivel and  hip-u-matic concontour, Retief leafed through a folder labelled \"CERP  7-602-Ba; CROANIE (general).\" He paused at a page headed Industry.\n\n\n Still reading, he opened the desk drawer, took out the two bottles of  Bacchus wine and two glasses. He poured an inch of wine into each and  sipped the black wine meditatively.\n\n\n It would be a pity, he reflected, if anything should interfere with the  production of such vintages....\n\n\n Half an hour later he laid the folder aside, keyed the phone and put  through a call to the Croanie Legation. He asked for the Commercial  Attache.\n\n\n \"Retief here, Corps HQ,\" he said airily. \"About the MEDDLE shipment,  the tractors. I'm wondering if there's been a slip up. My records show  we're shipping five hundred units....\"\n\n\n \"That's correct. Five hundred.\"\n\n\n Retief waited.\n\n\n \"Ah ... are you there, Retief?\"\n\n\n \"I'm still here. And I'm still wondering about the five hundred  tractors.\"\n\n\n \"It's perfectly in order. I thought it was all settled. Mr. Whaffle\u2014\"\n\n\n \"One unit would require a good-sized plant to handle its output,\"  Retief said. \"Now Croanie subsists on her fisheries. She has perhaps  half a dozen pint-sized processing plants. Maybe, in a bind, they  could handle the ore ten WV's could scrape up ... if Croanie had any  ore. It doesn't. By the way, isn't a WV a poor choice as a mining  outfit? I should think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, Retief! Why all this interest in a few surplus tractors?  And in any event, what business is it of yours how we plan to use the  equipment? That's an internal affair of my government. Mr. Whaffle\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm not Mr. Whaffle. What are you going to do with the other four  hundred and ninety tractors?\"\n\n\n \"I understood the grant was to be with no strings attached!\"\n\n\n \"I know it's bad manners to ask questions. It's an old diplomatic  tradition that any time you can get anybody to accept anything as a  gift, you've scored points in the game. But if Croanie has some scheme  cooking\u2014\" \"Nothing like that, Retief. It's a mere business transaction.\"\n\n\n \"What kind of business do you do with a Bolo WV? With or without a  blade attached, it's what's known as a continental siege unit.\"\n\n\n \"Great Heavens, Retief! Don't jump to conclusions! Would you have us  branded as warmongers? Frankly\u2014is this a closed line?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. You may speak freely.\"\n\n\n \"The tractors are for transshipment. We've gotten ourselves into a  difficult situation, balance-of-payments-wise. This is an accommodation  to a group with which we have rather strong business ties.\"\n\n\n \"I understand you hold a mortgage on the best land on Lovenbroy,\"  Retief said. \"Any connection?\"\n\n\n \"Why ... ah ... no. Of course not, ha ha.\"\n\n\n \"Who gets the tractors eventually?\"\n\n\n \"Retief, this is unwarranted interference!\"\n\n\n \"Who gets them?\"\n\n\n \"They happen to be going to Lovenbroy. But I scarcely see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who's the friend you're helping out with an unauthorized  transshipment of grant material?\"\n\n\n \"Why ... ah ... I've been working with a Mr. Gulver, a Bogan  representative.\"\n\n\n \"And when will they be shipped?\"\n\n\n \"Why, they went out a week ago. They'll be half way there by now. But  look here, Retief, this isn't what you're thinking!\"\n\n\n \"How do you know what I'm thinking? I don't know myself.\" Retief rang  off, buzzed the secretary.\n\n\n \"Miss Furkle, I'd like to be notified immediately of any new  applications that might come in from the Bogan Consulate for placement  of students.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it happens, by coincidence, that I have an application here now.  Mr. Gulver of the Consulate brought it in.\"\n\n\n \"Is Mr. Gulver in the office? I'd like to see him.\"\n\n\n \"I'll ask him if he has time.\"\n\n\n \"Great. Thanks.\" It was half a minute before a thick-necked red-faced  man in a tight hat walked in. He wore an old-fashioned suit, a drab  shirt, shiny shoes with round toes and an ill-tempered expression. \"What is it you wish?\" he barked. \"I understood in my discussions with  the other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for these  irritating conferences.\"\n\n\n \"I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. How  many this time?\"\n\n\n \"Two thousand.\"\n\n\n \"And where will they be going?\"\n\n\n \"Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job is  to provide transportation.\"\n\n\n \"Will there be any other students embarking this season?\"\n\n\n \"Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business.\" Gulver looked at Retief with  pursed lips. \"As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching another  two thousand to Featherweight.\"\n\n\n \"Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,\"  Retief said. \"Your people must be unusually interested in that region  of space.\"\n\n\n \"If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters of  importance to see to.\"\n\n\n After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. \"I'd like to have a  break-out of all the student movements that have been planned under the  present program,\" he said. \"And see if you can get a summary of what  MEDDLE has been shipping lately.\"\n\n\n Miss Furkle compressed her lips. \"If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm sure  he wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.  I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the Croanie  Legation\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The lists, Miss Furkle.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not accustomed,\" Miss Furkle said, \"to intruding in matters  outside our interest cluster.\"\n\n\n \"That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But never  mind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.\"\n\n\n \"Loyalty to my Chief\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the material  I've asked for,\" Retief said. \"I'm taking full responsibility. Now  scat.\"\n\n\n The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. \"MUDDLE, Retief speaking....\"\n\n\n Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.\n\n\n \"How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.\"\n\n\n In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. \"Sorry if I'm rushing you,  Retief,\" he said. \"But have you got anything for me?\"\n\n\n Retief waved at the wine bottles. \"What do you know about Croanie?\"\n\n\n \"Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you like  fish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoon  time. Over a foot long.\"\n\n\n \"You on good terms with them?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.\"\n\n\n \"So?\"\n\n\n \"Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over here  a dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot of  bad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easy  game.\"\n\n\n Miss Furkle buzzed. \"I have your lists,\" she said shortly.\n\n\n \"Bring them in, please.\" The secretary placed the papers on the desk. Arapoulous caught her eye  and grinned. She sniffed and marched from the room.\n\n\n \"What that gal needs is a slippery time in the grape mash,\" Arapoulous  observed. Retief thumbed through the papers, pausing to read from time  to time. He finished and looked at Arapoulous.\n\n\n \"How many men do you need for the harvest, Hank?\" Retief inquired.\n\n\n Arapoulous sniffed his wine glass and looked thoughtful.\n\n\n \"A hundred would help,\" he said. \"A thousand would be better. Cheers.\"\n\n\n \"What would you say to two thousand?\"\n\n\n \"Two thousand? Retief, you're not fooling?\"\n\n\n \"I hope not.\" He picked up the phone, called the Port Authority, asked  for the dispatch clerk.\n\n\n \"Hello, Jim. Say, I have a favor to ask of you. You know that  contingent of Bogan students. They're traveling aboard the two CDT  transports. I'm interested in the baggage that goes with the students.  Has it arrived yet? Okay, I'll wait.\"\n\n\n Jim came back to the phone. \"Yeah, Retief, it's here. Just arrived.  But there's a funny thing. It's not consigned to d'Land. It's ticketed  clear through to Lovenbroy.\"\n\n\n \"Listen, Jim,\" Retief said. \"I want you to go over to the warehouse and  take a look at that baggage for me.\"\n\n\n Retief waited while the dispatch clerk carried out the errand. The  level in the two bottles had gone down an inch when Jim returned to  the phone.\n\n\n \"Hey, I took a look at that baggage, Retief. Something funny going on.  Guns. 2mm needlers, Mark XII hand blasters, power pistols\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It's okay, Jim. Nothing to worry about. Just a mix-up. Now, Jim,  I'm going to ask you to do something more for me. I'm covering for a  friend. It seems he slipped up. I wouldn't want word to get out, you  understand. I'll send along a written change order in the morning that  will cover you officially. Meanwhile, here's what I want you to do....\"\n\n\n Retief gave instructions, then rang off and turned to Arapoulous.\n\n\n \"As soon as I get off a couple of TWX's, I think we'd better get down  to the port, Hank. I think I'd like to see the students off personally.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow is Croanie going to affect Lovenbroy?\u00a0\n\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They are going to steal all its wine.\n\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are going to invade it.\u00a0\n\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are going to invade it.\u00a0\n\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are going to invade it.\u00a0\n\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

I  fancy I've made MUDDLE what it is today. Frankly, I question the  wisdom of placing you in charge of such a sensitive desk, even for two  weeks. But remember. Yours is purely a rubber-stamp function.\"\n\n\n \"In that case, let's leave it to Miss Furkle. I'll take a couple of  weeks off myself. With her poundage, she could bring plenty of pressure  to bear.\"\n\n\n \"I assume you jest, Retief,\" Magnan said sadly. \"I should expect even  you to appreciate that Bogan participation in the Exchange Program may  be the first step toward sublimation of their aggressions into more  cultivated channels.\"\n\n\n \"I see they're sending two thousand students to d'Land,\" Retief said,  glancing at the Memo for Record. \"That's a sizable sublimation.\"\n\n\n Magnan nodded. \"The Bogans have launched no less than four military  campaigns in the last two decades. They're known as the Hoodlums of  the Nicodemean Cluster. Now, perhaps, we shall see them breaking that  precedent and entering into the cultural life of the Galaxy.\"\n\n\n \"Breaking and entering,\" Retief said. \"You may have something there.  But I'm wondering what they'll study on d'Land. That's an industrial  world of the poor but honest variety.\"\n\n\n \"Academic details are the affair of the students and their professors,\"  Magnan said. \"Our function is merely to bring them together. See  that you don't antagonize the Bogan representative. This will  be an excellent opportunity for you to practice your diplomatic  restraint\u2014not your strong point, I'm sure you'll agree.\"\n\n\n A buzzer sounded. Retief punched a button. \"What is it, Miss Furkle?\"\n\n\n \"That\u2014bucolic person from Lovenbroy is here again.\" On the small desk  screen, Miss Furkle's meaty features were compressed in disapproval.\n\n\n \"This fellow's a confounded pest. I'll leave him to you, Retief,\"  Magnan said. \"Tell him something. Get rid of him. And remember: here  at Corps HQ, all eyes are upon you.\"\n\n\n \"If I'd thought of that, I'd have worn my other suit,\" Retief said.\n\n\n Magnan snorted and passed from view. Retief punched Miss Furkle's  button.\n\n\n \"Send the bucolic person in.\" A tall broad man with bronze skin and gray hair, wearing tight trousers  of heavy cloth, a loose shirt open at the neck and a short jacket,  stepped into the room. He had a bundle under his arm. He paused at  sight of Retief, looked him over momentarily, then advanced and held  out his hand. Retief took it. For a moment the two big men stood, face  to face. The newcomer's jaw muscles knotted. Then he winced.\n\n\n Retief dropped his hand and motioned to a chair.\n\n\n \"That's nice knuckle work, mister,\" the stranger said, massaging his  hand. \"First time anybody ever did that to me. My fault though. I  started it, I guess.\" He grinned and sat down.\n\n\n \"What can I do for you?\" Retief said.\n\n\n \"You work for this Culture bunch, do you? Funny. I thought they were  all ribbon-counter boys. Never mind. I'm Hank Arapoulous. I'm a farmer.  What I wanted to see you about was\u2014\" He shifted in his chair. \"Well,  out on Lovenbroy we've got a serious problem. The wine crop is just  about ready. We start picking in another two, three months. Now I don't  know if you're familiar with the Bacchus vines we grow...?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Retief said. \"Have a cigar?\" He pushed a box across the desk.  Arapoulous took one. \"Bacchus vines are an unusual crop,\" he said,  puffing the cigar alight. \"Only mature every twelve years. In between,  the vines don't need a lot of attention, so our time's mostly our own.  We like to farm, though. Spend a lot of time developing new forms.  Apples the size of a melon\u2014and sweet\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sounds very pleasant,\" Retief said. \"Where does the Libraries and  Education Division come in?\"\n\n\n Arapoulous leaned forward. \"We go in pretty heavy for the arts. Folks  can't spend all their time hybridizing plants. We've turned all the  land area we've got into parks and farms. Course, we left some sizable  forest areas for hunting and such. Lovenbroy's a nice place, Mr.  Retief.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds like it, Mr. Arapoulous. Just what\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Call me Hank. We've got long seasons back home. Five of 'em. Our  year's about eighteen Terry months. Cold as hell in winter; eccentric  orbit, you know. Blue-black sky, stars visible all day. We do mostly  painting and sculpture in the winter. Then Spring; still plenty cold.  Lots of skiing, bob-sledding, ice skating; and it's the season for  woodworkers. Our furniture\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I've seen some of your furniture,\" Retief said. \"Beautiful work.\"\n\n\n Arapoulous nodded. \"All local timbers too. Lots of metals in our soil  and those sulphates give the woods some color, I'll tell you. Then  comes the Monsoon. Rain\u2014it comes down in sheets. But the sun's getting  closer. Shines all the time. Ever seen it pouring rain in the sunshine?  That's the music-writing season. Then summer. Summer's hot. We stay  inside in the daytime and have beach parties all night. Lots of beach  on Lovenbroy; we're mostly islands. That's the drama and symphony time.  The theatres are set up on the sand, or anchored off-shore. You have  the music and the surf and the bonfires and stars\u2014we're close to the  center of a globular cluster, you know....\"\n\n\n \"You say it's time now for the wine crop?\"\n\n\n \"That's right. Autumn's our harvest season. Most years we have just the  ordinary crops. Fruit, grain, that kind of thing; getting it in doesn't  take long. We spend most of the time on architecture, getting new  places ready for the winter or remodeling the older ones. We spend a  lot of time in our houses. We like to have them comfortable. But this  year's different. This is Wine Year.\" Arapoulous puffed on his cigar, looked worriedly at Retief. \"Our wine  crop is our big money crop,\" he said. \"We make enough to keep us going.  But this year....\"\n\n\n \"The crop isn't panning out?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, the crop's fine. One of the best I can remember. Course, I'm only  twenty-eight; I can't remember but two other harvests. The problem's  not the crop.\"\n\n\n \"Have you lost your markets? That sounds like a matter for the  Commercial\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Lost our markets? Mister, nobody that ever tasted our wines ever  settled for anything else!\"\n\n\n \"It sounds like I've been missing something,\" said Retief. \"I'll have  to try them some time.\"\n\n\n Arapoulous put his bundle on the desk, pulled off the wrappings. \"No  time like the present,\" he said.\n\n\n Retief looked at the two squat bottles, one green, one amber, both  dusty, with faded labels, and blackened corks secured by wire.\n\n\n \"Drinking on duty is frowned on in the Corps, Mr. Arapoulous,\" he said.\n\n\n \"This isn't drinking . It's just wine.\" Arapoulous pulled the wire  retainer loose, thumbed the cork. It rose slowly, then popped in the  air. Arapoulous caught it. Aromatic fumes wafted from the bottle.  \"Besides, my feelings would be hurt if you didn't join me.\" He winked.\n\n\n Retief took two thin-walled glasses from a table beside the desk. \"Come  to think of it, we also have to be careful about violating quaint  native customs.\"\n\n\n Arapoulous filled the glasses. Retief picked one up, sniffed the deep  rust-colored fluid, tasted it, then took a healthy swallow. He looked  at Arapoulous thoughtfully.\n\n\n \"Hmmm. It tastes like salted pecans, with an undercurrent of crusted  port.\"\n\n\n \"Don't try to describe it, Mr. Retief,\" Arapoulous said. He took a  mouthful of wine, swished it around his teeth, swallowed. \"It's Bacchus  wine, that's all. Nothing like it in the Galaxy.\" He pushed the second  bottle toward Retief. \"The custom back home is to alternate red wine  and black.\" Retief put aside his cigar, pulled the wires loose, nudged the cork,  caught it as it popped up.\n\n\n \"Bad luck if you miss the cork,\" Arapoulous said, nodding. \"You  probably never heard about the trouble we had on Lovenbroy a few years  back?\"\n\n\n \"Can't say that I did, Hank.\" Retief poured the black wine into two  fresh glasses. \"Here's to the harvest.\"\n\n\n \"We've got plenty of minerals on Lovenbroy,\" Arapoulous said,  swallowing wine. \"But we don't plan to wreck the landscape mining 'em.  We like to farm. About ten years back some neighbors of ours landed a  force. They figured they knew better what to do with our minerals than  we did. Wanted to strip-mine, smelt ore. We convinced 'em otherwise.  But it took a year, and we lost a lot of men.\"\n\n\n \"That's too bad,\" Retief said. \"I'd say this one tastes more like roast  beef and popcorn over a Riesling base.\"\n\n\n \"It put us in a bad spot,\" Arapoulous went on. \"We had to borrow  money from a world called Croanie. Mortgaged our crops. Had to start  exporting art work too. Plenty of buyers, but it's not the same when  you're doing it for strangers.\"\n\n\n \"Say, this business of alternating drinks is the real McCoy,\" Retief  said. \"What's the problem? Croanie about to foreclose?\"\n\n\n \"Well, the loan's due. The wine crop would put us in the clear. But  we need harvest hands. Picking Bacchus grapes isn't a job you can  turn over to machinery\u2014and anyway we wouldn't if we could. Vintage  season is the high point of living on Lovenbroy. Everybody joins in.  First, there's the picking in the fields. Miles and miles of vineyards  covering the mountain sides, and crowding the river banks, with gardens  here and there. Big vines, eight feet high, loaded with fruit, and deep  grass growing between. The wine-carriers keep on the run, bringing wine  to the pickers. There's prizes for the biggest day's output, bets on  who can fill the most baskets in an hour.... The sun's high and bright,  and it's just cool enough to give you plenty of energy. Come nightfall,  the tables are set up in the garden plots, and the feast is laid on:  roast turkeys, beef, hams, all kinds of fowl. Big salads. Plenty of  fruit. Fresh-baked bread ... and wine, plenty of wine. The cooking's  done by a different crew each night in each garden, and there's prizes  for the best crews.\n\n\n \"Then the wine-making. We still tramp out the vintage. That's mostly  for the young folks but anybody's welcome. That's when things start to  get loosened up. Matter of fact, pretty near half our young-uns are  born after a vintage. All bets are off then. It keeps a fellow on his  toes though. Ever tried to hold onto a gal wearing nothing but a layer  of grape juice?\" \"Never did,\" Retief said. \"You say most of the children are born after  a vintage. That would make them only twelve years old by the time\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's Lovenbroy years; they'd be eighteen, Terry reckoning.\"\n\n\n \"I was thinking you looked a little mature for twenty-eight,\" Retief  said.\n\n\n \"Forty-two, Terry years,\" Arapoulous said. \"But this year it looks bad.  We've got a bumper crop\u2014and we're short-handed. If we don't get a big  vintage, Croanie steps in. Lord knows what they'll do to the land. Then  next vintage time, with them holding half our grape acreage\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You hocked the vineyards?\"\n\n\n \"Yep. Pretty dumb, huh? But we figured twelve years was a long time.\"\n\n\n \"On the whole,\" Retief said, \"I think I prefer the black. But the red  is hard to beat....\"\n\n\n \"What we figured was, maybe you Culture boys could help us out. A loan  to see us through the vintage, enough to hire extra hands. Then we'd  repay it in sculpture, painting, furniture\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sorry, Hank. All we do here is work out itineraries for traveling  side-shows, that kind of thing. Now, if you needed a troop of Groaci  nose-flute players\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Can they pick grapes?\"\n\n\n \"Nope. Anyway, they can't stand the daylight. Have you talked this over  with the Labor Office?\"\n\n\n \"Sure did. They said they'd fix us up with all the electronics  specialists and computer programmers we wanted\u2014but no field hands.  Said it was what they classified as menial drudgery; you'd have thought  I was trying to buy slaves.\"\n\n\n The buzzer sounded. Miss Furkle's features appeared on the desk screen.\n\n\n \"You're due at the Intergroup Council in five minutes,\" she said. \"Then  afterwards, there are the Bogan students to meet.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks.\" Retief finished his glass, stood. \"I have to run, Hank,\" he  said. \"Let me think this over. Maybe I can come up with something.  Check with me day after tomorrow. And you'd better leave the bottles  here. Cultural exhibits, you know.\" II\n\n\n As the council meeting broke up, Retief caught the eye of a colleague  across the table.\n\n\n \"Mr. Whaffle, you mentioned a shipment going to a place called Croanie.  What are they getting?\"\n\n\n Whaffle blinked. \"You're the fellow who's filling in for Magnan, over  at MUDDLE,\" he said. \"Properly speaking, equipment grants are the  sole concern of the Motorized Equipment Depot, Division of Loans and  Exchanges.\" He pursed his lips. \"However, I suppose there's no harm in  telling you. They'll be receiving heavy mining equipment.\"\n\n\n \"Drill rigs, that sort of thing?\"\n\n\n \"Strip mining gear.\" Whaffle took a slip of paper from a breast pocket,  blinked at it. \"Bolo Model WV/1 tractors, to be specific. Why is MUDDLE  interested in MEDDLE's activities?\"\n\n\n \"Forgive my curiosity, Mr. Whaffle. It's just that Croanie cropped up  earlier today. It seems she holds a mortgage on some vineyards over  on\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's not MEDDLE's affair, sir,\" Whaffle cut in. \"I have sufficient  problems as Chief of MEDDLE without probing into MUDDLE'S business.\"\n\n\n \"Speaking of tractors,\" another man put in, \"we over at the Special  Committee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Under-developed Nations'  General Economies have been trying for months to get a request for  mining equipment for d'Land through MEDDLE\u2014\"\n\n\n \"SCROUNGE was late on the scene,\" Whaffle said. \"First come, first  served. That's our policy at MEDDLE. Good day, gentlemen.\" He strode  off, briefcase under his arm.\n\n\n \"That's the trouble with peaceful worlds,\" the SCROUNGE committeeman  said. \"Boge is a troublemaker, so every agency in the Corps is out  to pacify her. While my chance to make a record\u2014that is, assist  peace-loving d'Land\u2014comes to naught.\" He shook his head.\n\n\n \"What kind of university do they have on d'Land?\" asked Retief. \"We're  sending them two thousand exchange students. It must be quite an  institution.\"\n\n\n \"University? D'Land has one under-endowed technical college.\"\n\n\n \"Will all the exchange students be studying at the Technical College?\"\n\n\n \"Two thousand students? Hah! Two hundred students would overtax the  facilities of the college.\"\n\n\n \"I wonder if the Bogans know that?\"\n\n\n \"The Bogans? Why, most of d'Land's difficulties are due to the unwise  trade agreement she entered into with Boge. Two thousand students  indeed!\" He snorted and walked away. Retief stopped by the office to pick up a short cape, then rode the  elevator to the roof of the 230-story Corps HQ building and hailed a  cab to the port. The Bogan students had arrived early. Retief saw them  lined up on the ramp waiting to go through customs. It would be half  an hour before they were cleared through. He turned into the bar and  ordered a beer.\n\n\n A tall young fellow on the next stool raised his glass.\n\n\n \"Happy days,\" he said.\n\n\n \"And nights to match.\"\n\n\n \"You said it.\" He gulped half his beer. \"My name's Karsh. Mr. Karsh.  Yep, Mr. Karsh. Boy, this is a drag, sitting around this place  waiting....\"\n\n\n \"You meeting somebody?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Bunch of babies. Kids. How they expect\u2014Never mind. Have one on  me.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks. You a Scoutmaster?\"\n\n\n \"I'll tell you what I am. I'm a cradle-robber. You know\u2014\" he turned  to Retief\u2014\"not one of those kids is over eighteen.\" He hiccupped.  \"Students, you know. Never saw a student with a beard, did you?\"\n\n\n \"Lots of times. You're meeting the students, are you?\"\n\n\n The young fellow blinked at Retief. \"Oh, you know about it, huh?\"\n\n\n \"I represent MUDDLE.\"\n\n\n Karsh finished his beer, ordered another. \"I came on ahead. Sort of  an advance guard for the kids. I trained 'em myself. Treated it like  a game, but they can handle a CSU. Don't know how they'll act under  pressure. If I had my old platoon\u2014\"\n\n\n He looked at his beer glass, pushed it back. \"Had enough,\" he said. \"So  long, friend. Or are you coming along?\"\n\n\n Retief nodded. \"Might as well.\" At the exit to the Customs enclosure, Retief watched as the first of  the Bogan students came through, caught sight of Karsh and snapped to  attention, his chest out.\n\n\n \"Drop that, mister,\" Karsh snapped. \"Is that any way for a student to  act?\"\n\n\n The youth, a round-faced lad with broad shoulders, grinned.\n\n\n \"Heck, no,\" he said. \"Say, uh, Mr. Karsh, are we gonna get to go to  town? We fellas were thinking\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You were, hah? You act like a bunch of school kids! I mean ... no! Now  line up!\"\n\n\n \"We have quarters ready for the students,\" Retief said. \"If you'd like  to bring them around to the west side, I have a couple of copters laid  on.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Karsh. \"They'll stay here until take-off time. Can't  have the little dears wandering around loose. Might get ideas about  going over the hill.\" He hiccupped. \"I mean they might play hookey.\"\n\n\n \"We've scheduled your re-embarkation for noon tomorrow. That's a long  wait. MUDDLE's arranged theater tickets and a dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Sorry,\" Karsh said. \"As soon as the baggage gets here, we're off.\" He  hiccupped again. \"Can't travel without our baggage, y'know.\"\n\n\n \"Suit yourself,\" Retief said. \"Where's the baggage now?\"\n\n\n \"Coming in aboard a Croanie lighter.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe you'd like to arrange for a meal for the students here.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Karsh said. \"That's a good idea. Why don't you join us?\" Karsh  winked. \"And bring a few beers.\"\n\n\n \"Not this time,\" Retief said. He watched the students, still emerging  from Customs. \"They seem to be all boys,\" he commented. \"No female  students?\"\n\n\n \"Maybe later,\" Karsh said. \"You know, after we see how the first bunch  is received.\"\n\n\n Back at the MUDDLE office, Retief buzzed Miss Furkle.\n\n\n \"Do you know the name of the institution these Bogan students are bound  for?\"\n\n\n \"Why, the University at d'Land, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Would that be the Technical College?\"\n\n\n Miss Furkle's mouth puckered. \"I'm sure I've never pried into these  details.\"\n\n\n \"Where does doing your job stop and prying begin, Miss Furkle?\" Retief  said. \"Personally, I'm curious as to just what it is these students are  travelling so far to study\u2014at Corps expense.\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Magnan never\u2014\"\n\n\n \"For the present. Miss Furkle, Mr. Magnan is vacationing. That leaves  me with the question of two thousand young male students headed for  a world with no classrooms for them ... a world in need of tractors.  But the tractors are on their way to Croanie, a world under obligation  to Boge. And Croanie holds a mortgage on the best grape acreage on  Lovenbroy.\"\n\n\n \"Well!\" Miss Furkle snapped, small eyes glaring under unplucked brows.  \"I hope you're not questioning Mr. Magnan's wisdom!\"\n\n\n \"About Mr. Magnan's wisdom there can be no question,\" Retief said. \"But  never mind. I'd like you to look up an item for me. How many tractors  will Croanie be getting under the MEDDLE program?\"\n\n\n \"Why, that's entirely MEDDLE business,\" Miss Furkle said. \"Mr. Magnan  always\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure he did. Let me know about the tractors as soon as you can.\" Miss Furkle sniffed and disappeared from the screen. Retief left the  office, descended forty-one stories, followed a corridor to the Corps  Library. In the stacks he thumbed through catalogues, pored over  indices.\n\n\n \"Can I help you?\" someone chirped. A tiny librarian stood at his elbow.\n\n\n \"Thank you, ma'am,\" Retief said. \"I'm looking for information on a  mining rig. A Bolo model WV tractor.\"\n\n\n \"You won't find it in the industrial section,\" the librarian said.  \"Come along.\" Retief followed her along the stacks to a well-lit  section lettered ARMAMENTS. She took a tape from the shelf, plugged  it into the viewer, flipped through and stopped at a squat armored  vehicle.\n\n\n \"That's the model WV,\" she said. \"It's what is known as a continental  siege unit. It carries four men, with a half-megaton/second firepower.\"\n\n\n \"There must be an error somewhere,\" Retief said. \"The Bolo model I want  is a tractor. Model WV M-1\u2014\" \"Oh, the modification was the addition of a bulldozer blade for  demolition work. That must be what confused you.\"\n\n\n \"Probably\u2014among other things. Thank you.\"\n\n\n Miss Furkle was waiting at the office. \"I have the information you  wanted,\" she said. \"I've had it for over ten minutes. I was under the  impression you needed it urgently, and I went to great lengths\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" Retief said. \"Shoot. How many tractors?\"\n\n\n \"Five hundred.\"\n\n\n \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\n Miss Furkle's chins quivered. \"Well! If you feel I'm incompetent\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Just questioning the possibility of a mistake, Miss Furkle. Five  hundred tractors is a lot of equipment.\"\n\n\n \"Was there anything further?\" Miss Furkle inquired frigidly.\n\n\n \"I sincerely hope not,\" Retief said. III\n\n\n Leaning back in Magnan's padded chair with power swivel and  hip-u-matic concontour, Retief leafed through a folder labelled \"CERP  7-602-Ba; CROANIE (general).\" He paused at a page headed Industry.\n\n\n Still reading, he opened the desk drawer, took out the two bottles of  Bacchus wine and two glasses. He poured an inch of wine into each and  sipped the black wine meditatively.\n\n\n It would be a pity, he reflected, if anything should interfere with the  production of such vintages....\n\n\n Half an hour later he laid the folder aside, keyed the phone and put  through a call to the Croanie Legation. He asked for the Commercial  Attache.\n\n\n \"Retief here, Corps HQ,\" he said airily. \"About the MEDDLE shipment,  the tractors. I'm wondering if there's been a slip up. My records show  we're shipping five hundred units....\"\n\n\n \"That's correct. Five hundred.\"\n\n\n Retief waited.\n\n\n \"Ah ... are you there, Retief?\"\n\n\n \"I'm still here. And I'm still wondering about the five hundred  tractors.\"\n\n\n \"It's perfectly in order. I thought it was all settled. Mr. Whaffle\u2014\"\n\n\n \"One unit would require a good-sized plant to handle its output,\"  Retief said. \"Now Croanie subsists on her fisheries. She has perhaps  half a dozen pint-sized processing plants. Maybe, in a bind, they  could handle the ore ten WV's could scrape up ... if Croanie had any  ore. It doesn't. By the way, isn't a WV a poor choice as a mining  outfit? I should think\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, Retief! Why all this interest in a few surplus tractors?  And in any event, what business is it of yours how we plan to use the  equipment? That's an internal affair of my government. Mr. Whaffle\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm not Mr. Whaffle. What are you going to do with the other four  hundred and ninety tractors?\"\n\n\n \"I understood the grant was to be with no strings attached!\"\n\n\n \"I know it's bad manners to ask questions. It's an old diplomatic  tradition that any time you can get anybody to accept anything as a  gift, you've scored points in the game. But if Croanie has some scheme  cooking\u2014\" \"Nothing like that, Retief. It's a mere business transaction.\"\n\n\n \"What kind of business do you do with a Bolo WV? With or without a  blade attached, it's what's known as a continental siege unit.\"\n\n\n \"Great Heavens, Retief! Don't jump to conclusions! Would you have us  branded as warmongers? Frankly\u2014is this a closed line?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. You may speak freely.\"\n\n\n \"The tractors are for transshipment. We've gotten ourselves into a  difficult situation, balance-of-payments-wise. This is an accommodation  to a group with which we have rather strong business ties.\"\n\n\n \"I understand you hold a mortgage on the best land on Lovenbroy,\"  Retief said. \"Any connection?\"\n\n\n \"Why ... ah ... no. Of course not, ha ha.\"\n\n\n \"Who gets the tractors eventually?\"\n\n\n \"Retief, this is unwarranted interference!\"\n\n\n \"Who gets them?\"\n\n\n \"They happen to be going to Lovenbroy. But I scarcely see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And who's the friend you're helping out with an unauthorized  transshipment of grant material?\"\n\n\n \"Why ... ah ... I've been working with a Mr. Gulver, a Bogan  representative.\"\n\n\n \"And when will they be shipped?\"\n\n\n \"Why, they went out a week ago. They'll be half way there by now. But  look here, Retief, this isn't what you're thinking!\"\n\n\n \"How do you know what I'm thinking? I don't know myself.\" Retief rang  off, buzzed the secretary.\n\n\n \"Miss Furkle, I'd like to be notified immediately of any new  applications that might come in from the Bogan Consulate for placement  of students.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it happens, by coincidence, that I have an application here now.  Mr. Gulver of the Consulate brought it in.\"\n\n\n \"Is Mr. Gulver in the office? I'd like to see him.\"\n\n\n \"I'll ask him if he has time.\"\n\n\n \"Great. Thanks.\" It was half a minute before a thick-necked red-faced  man in a tight hat walked in. He wore an old-fashioned suit, a drab  shirt, shiny shoes with round toes and an ill-tempered expression. \"What is it you wish?\" he barked. \"I understood in my discussions with  the other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for these  irritating conferences.\"\n\n\n \"I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. How  many this time?\"\n\n\n \"Two thousand.\"\n\n\n \"And where will they be going?\"\n\n\n \"Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job is  to provide transportation.\"\n\n\n \"Will there be any other students embarking this season?\"\n\n\n \"Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business.\" Gulver looked at Retief with  pursed lips. \"As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching another  two thousand to Featherweight.\"\n\n\n \"Another under-populated world\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,\"  Retief said. \"Your people must be unusually interested in that region  of space.\"\n\n\n \"If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters of  importance to see to.\"\n\n\n After Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. \"I'd like to have a  break-out of all the student movements that have been planned under the  present program,\" he said. \"And see if you can get a summary of what  MEDDLE has been shipping lately.\"\n\n\n Miss Furkle compressed her lips. \"If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm sure  he wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.  I ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the Croanie  Legation\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The lists, Miss Furkle.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not accustomed,\" Miss Furkle said, \"to intruding in matters  outside our interest cluster.\"\n\n\n \"That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But never  mind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.\"\n\n\n \"Loyalty to my Chief\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the material  I've asked for,\" Retief said. \"I'm taking full responsibility. Now  scat.\"\n\n\n The buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. \"MUDDLE, Retief speaking....\"\n\n\n Arapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.\n\n\n \"How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.\"\n\n\n In the office, Arapoulous took a chair. \"Sorry if I'm rushing you,  Retief,\" he said. \"But have you got anything for me?\"\n\n\n Retief waved at the wine bottles. \"What do you know about Croanie?\"\n\n\n \"Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you like  fish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoon  time. Over a foot long.\"\n\n\n \"You on good terms with them?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.\"\n\n\n \"So?\"\n\n\n \"Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over here  a dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot of  bad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easy  game.\"\n\n\n Miss Furkle buzzed. \"I have your lists,\" she said shortly.\n\n\n \"Bring them in, please.\" The secretary placed the papers on the desk. Arapoulous caught her eye  and grinned. She sniffed and marched from the room.\n\n\n \"What that gal needs is a slippery time in the grape mash,\" Arapoulous  observed. Retief thumbed through the papers, pausing to read from time  to time. He finished and looked at Arapoulous.\n\n\n \"How many men do you need for the harvest, Hank?\" Retief inquired.\n\n\n Arapoulous sniffed his wine glass and looked thoughtful.\n\n\n \"A hundred would help,\" he said. \"A thousand would be better. Cheers.\"\n\n\n \"What would you say to two thousand?\"\n\n\n \"Two thousand? Retief, you're not fooling?\"\n\n\n \"I hope not.\" He picked up the phone, called the Port Authority, asked  for the dispatch clerk.\n\n\n \"Hello, Jim. Say, I have a favor to ask of you. You know that  contingent of Bogan students. They're traveling aboard the two CDT  transports. I'm interested in the baggage that goes with the students.  Has it arrived yet? Okay, I'll wait.\"\n\n\n Jim came back to the phone. \"Yeah, Retief, it's here. Just arrived.  But there's a funny thing. It's not consigned to d'Land. It's ticketed  clear through to Lovenbroy.\"\n\n\n \"Listen, Jim,\" Retief said. \"I want you to go over to the warehouse and  take a look at that baggage for me.\"\n\n\n Retief waited while the dispatch clerk carried out the errand. The  level in the two bottles had gone down an inch when Jim returned to  the phone.\n\n\n \"Hey, I took a look at that baggage, Retief. Something funny going on.  Guns. 2mm needlers, Mark XII hand blasters, power pistols\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It's okay, Jim. Nothing to worry about. Just a mix-up. Now, Jim,  I'm going to ask you to do something more for me. I'm covering for a  friend. It seems he slipped up. I wouldn't want word to get out, you  understand. I'll send along a written change order in the morning that  will cover you officially. Meanwhile, here's what I want you to do....\"\n\n\n Retief gave instructions, then rang off and turned to Arapoulous.\n\n\n \"As soon as I get off a couple of TWX's, I think we'd better get down  to the port, Hank. I think I'd like to see the students off personally.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow is Croanie going to affect Lovenbroy?\u00a0\n\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They are going to steal all its wine.\n\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are going to invade it.\u00a0\n\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are going to invade it.\u00a0\n\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are going to invade it.\u00a0\n\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
