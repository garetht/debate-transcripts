      "background_text": "THE RECRUIT BY BRYCE WALTON It was dirty work, but it would\n\n make him a man. And kids had a\n\n right to grow up\u2014some of them!\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1962.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Wayne, unseen, sneered down from the head of the stairs.\n\n\n The old man with his thick neck, thick cigar, evening highball, potgut  and bald head without a brain in it. His slim mother with nervously  polite smiles and voice fluttering, assuring the old man by her frailty  that he was big in the world. They were squareheads one and all,  marking moron time in a gray dream. Man, was he glad to break out.\n\n\n The old man said, \"He'll be okay. Let him alone.\"\n\n\n \"But he won't eat. Just lies there all the time.\"\n\n\n \"Hell,\" the old man said. \"Sixteen's a bad time. School over, waiting  for the draft and all. He's in between. It's rough.\"\n\n\n Mother clasped her forearms and shook her head once slowly.\n\n\n \"We got to let him go, Eva. It's a dangerous time. You got to remember  about all these dangerous repressed impulses piling up with nowhere to  go, like they say. You read the books.\"\n\n\n \"But he's unhappy.\"\n\n\n \"Are we specialists? That's the Youth Board's headache, ain't it? What  do we know about adolescent trauma and like that? Now get dressed or  we'll be late.\"\n\n\n Wayne watched the ritual, grinning. He listened to their purposeless  noises, their blabbing and yakking as if they had something to say.  Blab-blab about the same old bones, and end up chewing them in the  same old ways. Then they begin all over again. A freak sideshow all the  way to nowhere. Squareheads going around either unconscious or with  eyes looking dead from the millennium in the office waiting to retire  into limbo.\n\n\n How come he'd been stuck with parental images like that? One  thing\u2014when he was jockeying a rocket to Mars or maybe firing the pants  off Asiatic reds in some steamy gone jungle paradise, he'd forget his  punkie origins in teeveeland.\n\n\n But the old man was right on for once about the dangerous repressed  impulses. Wayne had heard about it often enough. Anyway there was no  doubt about it when every move he made was a restrained explosion.  So he'd waited in his room, and it wasn't easy sweating it out alone  waiting for the breakout call from HQ.\n\n\n \"Well, dear, if you say so,\" Mother said, with the old resigned sigh  that must make the old man feel like Superman with a beerbelly.\n\n\n They heard Wayne slouching loosely down the stairs and looked up.\n\n\n \"Relax,\" Wayne said. \"You're not going anywhere tonight.\"\n\n\n \"What, son?\" his old man said uneasily. \"Sure we are. We're going to  the movies.\"\n\n\n He could feel them watching him, waiting; and yet still he didn't  answer. Somewhere out in suburban grayness a dog barked, then was  silent.\n\n\n \"Okay, go,\" Wayne said. \"If you wanta walk. I'm taking the family  boltbucket.\"\n\n\n \"But we promised the Clemons, dear,\" his mother said.\n\n\n \"Hell,\" Wayne said, grinning straight into the old man. \"I just got my  draft call.\"\n\n\n He saw the old man's Adam's apple move. \"Oh, my dear boy,\" Mother cried  out.\n\n\n \"So gimme the keys,\" Wayne said. The old man handed the keys over. His  understanding smile was strained, and fear flicked in his sagging eyes.\n\n\n \"Do be careful, dear,\" his mother said. She ran toward him as he  laughed and shut the door on her. He was still laughing as he whoomed  the Olds between the pale dead glow of houses and roared up the ramp  onto the Freeway. Ahead was the promising glitter of adventure-calling  neon, and he looked up at the high skies of night and his eyes sailed  the glaring wonders of escape. He burned off some rubber finding a slot in the park-lot. He strode  under a sign reading Public Youth Center No. 947 and walked casually  to the reception desk, where a thin man with sergeant's stripes and a  pansy haircut looked out of a pile of paperwork.\n\n\n \"Where you think you're going, my pretty lad?\"\n\n\n Wayne grinned down. \"Higher I hope than a typewriter jockey.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" the sergeant said. \"How tough we are this evening. You have a  pass, killer?\"\n\n\n \"Wayne Seton. Draft call.\"\n\n\n \"Oh.\" The sergeant checked his name off a roster and nodded. He wrote  on a slip of paper, handed the pass to Wayne. \"Go to the Armory and  check out whatever your lusting little heart desires. Then report to  Captain Jack, room 307.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, sarge dear,\" Wayne said and took the elevator up to the Armory.\n\n\n A tired fat corporal with a naked head blinked up at tall Wayne.  Finally he said, \"So make up your mind, bud. Think you're the only kid  breaking out tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Hold your teeth, pop,\" Wayne said, coolly and slowly lighting a  cigarette. \"I've decided.\"\n\n\n The corporal's little eyes studied Wayne with malicious amusement.  \"Take it from a vet, bud. Sooner you go the better. It's a big city and  you're starting late. You can get a cat, not a mouse, and some babes  are clever hellcats in a dark alley.\"\n\n\n \"You must be a genius,\" Wayne said. \"A corporal with no hair and still  a counterboy. I'm impressed. I'm all ears, Dad.\"\n\n\n The corporal sighed wearily. \"You can get that balloon head  ventilated, bud, and good.\"\n\n\n Wayne's mouth twitched. He leaned across the counter toward the  shelves and racks of weapons. \"I'll remember that crack when I get  my commission.\" He blew smoke in the corporal's face. \"Bring me a  Smith and Wesson .38, shoulder holster with spring-clip. And throw in  a Skelly switchblade for kicks\u2014the six-inch disguised job with the  double springs.\"\n\n\n The corporal waddled back with the revolver and the switchblade  disguised in a leather comb case. He checked them on a receipt ledger,  while Wayne examined the weapons, broke open the revolver, twirled the  cylinder and pushed cartridges into the waiting chamber. He slipped  the knife from the comb case, flicked open the blade and stared at its  gleam in the buttery light as his mouth went dry and the refracted  incandescence of it trickled on his brain like melted ice, exciting and  scary.\n\n\n He removed his leather jacket. He slung the holster under his left  armpit and tested the spring clip release several times, feeling the  way the serrated butt dropped into his wet palm. He put his jacket  back on and the switchblade case in his pocket. He walked toward the  elevator and didn't look back as the corporal said, \"Good luck, tiger.\"\n\n\n Captain Jack moved massively. The big stone-walled office, alive with  stuffed lion and tiger and gunracks, seemed to grow smaller. Captain  Jack crossed black-booted legs and whacked a cane at the floor. It had  a head shaped like a grinning bear.\n\n\n Wayne felt the assured smile die on his face. Something seemed to  shrink him. If he didn't watch himself he'd begin feeling like a pea  among bowling balls.\n\n\n Contemptuously amused little eyes glittered at Wayne from a shaggy  head. Shoulders hunched like stuffed sea-bags.\n\n\n \"Wayne Seton,\" said Captain Jack as if he were discussing something  in a bug collection. \"Well, well, you're really fired up aren't you?  Really going out to eat 'em. Right, punk?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said. He ran wet hands down the sides of his chinos.  His legs seemed sheathed in lead as he bit inwardly at shrinking fear  the way a dog snaps at a wound. You big overblown son, he thought, I'll  show you but good who is a punk. They made a guy wait and sweat until  he screamed. They kept a guy on the fire until desire leaped in him,  ran and billowed and roared until his brain was filled with it. But  that wasn't enough. If this muscle-bound creep was such a big boy,  what was he doing holding down a desk?\n\n\n \"Well, this is it, punk. You go the distance or start a butterfly  collection.\"\n\n\n The cane darted up. A blade snicked from the end and stopped an inch  from Wayne's nose. He jerked up a shaky hand involuntarily and clamped  a knuckle-ridged gag to his gasping mouth.\n\n\n Captain Jack chuckled. \"All right, superboy.\" He handed Wayne his  passcard. \"Curfew's off, punk, for 6 hours. You got 6 hours to make  out.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"Your beast is primed and waiting at the Four Aces Club on the West  Side. Know where that is, punk?\"\n\n\n \"No, sir, but I'll find it fast.\"\n\n\n \"Sure you will, punk,\" smiled Captain Jack. \"She'll be wearing yellow  slacks and a red shirt. Black hair, a cute trick. She's with a hefty  psycho who eats punks for breakfast. He's butchered five people.  They're both on top of the Undesirable list, Seton. They got to go and  they're your key to the stars.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said.\n\n\n \"So run along and make out, punk,\" grinned Captain Jack. A copcar stopped Wayne as he started over the bridge, out of bright  respectable neon into the murky westside slum over the river.\n\n\n Wayne waved the pass card, signed by Captain Jack, under the cop's  quivering nose. The cop shivered and stepped back and waved him on. The  Olds roared over the bridge as the night's rain blew away.\n\n\n The air through the open window was chill and damp coming from  Slumville, but Wayne felt a cold that wasn't of the night or the wind.  He turned off into a rat's warren of the inferiors. Lights turned pale,  secretive and sparse, the uncared-for streets became rough with pitted  potholes, narrow and winding and humid with wet unpleasant smells.  Wayne's fearful exhilaration increased as he cruised with bated breath  through the dark mazes of streets and rickety tenements crawling with  the shadows of mysterious promise.\n\n\n He found the alley, dark, a gloom-dripping tunnel. He drove cautiously  into it and rolled along, watching. His belly ached with expectancy as  he spotted the sick-looking dab of neon wanly sparkling. FOUR ACES CLUB He parked across the alley. He got out and stood in shadows, digging  the sultry beat of a combo, the wild pulse of drums and spinning brass  filtering through windows painted black.\n\n\n He breathed deep, started over, ducked back. A stewbum weaved out of  a bank of garbage cans, humming to himself, pulling at a rainsoaked  shirt clinging to a pale stick body. He reminded Wayne of a slim grub  balanced on one end.\n\n\n The stewbum stumbled. His bearded face in dim breaking moonlight had  a dirty, greenish tinge as he sensed Wayne there. He turned in a  grotesque uncoordinated jiggling and his eyes were wide with terror and  doom.\n\n\n \"I gotta hide, kid. They're on me.\"\n\n\n Wayne's chest rose and his hands curled.\n\n\n The bum's fingers drew at the air like white talons.\n\n\n \"Help me, kid.\"\n\n\n He turned with a scratchy cry and retreated before the sudden blast  of headlights from a Cad bulleting into the alley. The Cad rushed  past Wayne and he felt the engine-hot fumes against his legs. Tires  squealed. The Cad stopped and a teener in black jacket jumped out and  crouched as he began stalking the old rummy.\n\n\n \"This is him! This is him all right,\" the teener yelled, and one hand  came up swinging a baseball bat.\n\n\n A head bobbed out of the Cad window and giggled.\n\n\n The fumble-footed rummy tried to run and plopped on wet pavement. The  teener moved in, while a faint odor of burnt rubber hovered in the air  as the Cad cruised in a slow follow-up.\n\n\n Wayne's breath quickened as he watched, feeling somehow blank wonder  at finding himself there, free and breaking out at last with no curfew  and no law but his own. He felt as though he couldn't stop anything.  Living seemed directionless, but he still would go with it regardless,  until something dropped off or blew to hell like a hot light-bulb. He  held his breath, waiting. His body was tensed and rigid as he moved in  spirit with the hunting teener, an omniscient shadow with a hunting  license and a ghetto jungle twenty miles deep.\n\n\n The crawling stewbum screamed as the baseball bat whacked. The teener  laughed. Wayne wanted to shout. He opened his mouth, but the yell  clogged up somewhere, so that he remained soundless yet with his mouth  still open as he heard the payoff thuds where the useless wino curled  up with stick arms over his rheumy face.\n\n\n The teener laughed, tossed the bat away and began jumping up and down  with his hobnailed, mail-order air force boots. Then he ran into the  Cad. A hootch bottle soared out, made a brittle tink-tink of falling  glass.\n\n\n \"Go, man!\"\n\n\n The Cad wooshed by. It made a sort of hollow sucking noise as it  bounced over the old man twice. Then the finlights diminished like  bright wind-blown sparks.\n\n\n Wayne walked over and sneered down at the human garbage lying in  scummed rain pools. The smell of raw violence, the scent of blood, made  his heart thump like a trapped rubber ball in a cage.\n\n\n He hurried into the Four Aces, drawn by an exhilarating vision ... and  pursued by the hollow haunting fears of his own desires. He walked through the wavering haze of smoke and liquored dizziness and  stood until his eyes learned the dark. He spotted her red shirt and  yellow legs over in the corner above a murky lighted table.\n\n\n He walked toward her, watching her little subhuman pixie face lift.  The eyes widened with exciting terror, turned even paler behind a red  slash of sensuous mouth. Briefed and waiting, primed and eager for  running, she recognized her pursuer at once. He sat at a table near  her, watching and grinning and seeing her squirm.\n\n\n She sat in that slightly baffled, fearful and uncomprehending attitude  of being motionless, as though they were all actors performing in a  weirdo drama being staged in that smoky thick-aired dive.\n\n\n Wayne smiled with wry superiority at the redheaded psycho in a dirty  T-shirt, a big bruiser with a gorilla face. He was tussling his mouse  heavy.\n\n\n \"What's yours, teener?\" the slug-faced waiter asked.\n\n\n \"Bring me a Crusher, buddyroo,\" Wayne said, and flashed his pass card.\n\n\n \"Sure, teener.\"\n\n\n Red nuzzled the mouse's neck and made drooly noises. Wayne watched and  fed on the promising terror and helplessness of her hunted face. She  sat rigid, eyes fixed on Wayne like balls of frozen glass.\n\n\n Red looked up and stared straight at Wayne with eyes like black buttons  imbedded in the waxlike skin of his face. Then he grinned all on one  side. One huge hand scratched across the wet table top like a furious  cat's.\n\n\n Wayne returned the challenging move but felt a nervous twitch jerk at  his lips. A numbness covered his brain like a film as he concentrated  on staring down Red the psycho. But Red kept looking, his eyes bright  but dead. Then he began struggling it up again with the scared little  mouse.\n\n\n The waiter sat the Crusher down. Wayne signed a chit; tonight he was in  the pay of the state.\n\n\n \"What else, teener?\"\n\n\n \"One thing. Fade.\"\n\n\n \"Sure, teener,\" the waiter said, his breathy words dripping like syrup.\n\n\n Wayne drank. Liquored heat dripped into his stomach. Fire tickled his  veins, became hot wire twisting in his head.\n\n\n He drank again and forced out a shaky breath. The jazz beat thumped  fast and muted brass moaned. Drumpulse, stabbing trumpet raped the  air. Tension mounted as Wayne watched her pale throat convulsing, the  white eyelids fluttering. Red fingered at her legs and salivated at her  throat, glancing now and then at Wayne, baiting him good.\n\n\n \"Okay, you creep,\" Wayne said.\n\n\n He stood up and started through the haze. The psycho leaped and a table  crashed. Wayne's .38 dropped from its spring-clip holster and the blast  filled the room. The psycho screamed and stumbled toward the door  holding something in. The mouse darted by, eluded Wayne's grasp and was  out the door.\n\n\n Wayne went out after her in a laughing frenzy of release. He felt the  cold strange breath of moist air on his sweating skin as he sprinted  down the alley into a wind full of blowing wet.\n\n\n He ran laughing under the crazy starlight and glimpsed her now and  then, fading in and out of shadows, jumping, crawling, running with the  life-or-death animation of a wild deer.\n\n\n Up and down alleys, a rat's maze. A rabbit run. Across vacant lots.  Through shattered tenement ruins. Over a fence. There she was, falling,  sliding down a brick shute.\n\n\n He gained. He moved up. His labored breath pumped more fire. And her  scream was a rejuvenation hypo in his blood. She quivered above him on the stoop, panting, her eyes afire with  terror.\n\n\n \"You, baby,\" Wayne gasped. \"I gotcha.\"\n\n\n She backed into darkness, up there against the sagging tenement wall,  her arms out and poised like crippled wings. Wayne crept up. She gave  a squeaking sob, turned, ran. Wayne leaped into gloom. Wood cracked.  He clambered over rotten lumber. The doorway sagged and he hesitated  in the musty dark. A few feet away was the sound of loose trickling  plaster, a whimpering whine.\n\n\n \"No use running,\" Wayne said. \"Go loose. Give, baby. Give now.\"\n\n\n She scurried up sagging stairs. Wayne laughed and dug up after her,  feeling his way through debris. Dim moonlight filtered through a  sagging stairway from a shattered skylight three floors up. The mouse's  shadow floated ahead.\n\n\n He started up. The entire stair structure canted sickeningly. A railing  ripped and he nearly went with it back down to the first floor. He  heard a scream as rotten boards crumbled and dust exploded from  cracks. A rat ran past Wayne and fell into space. He burst into the  third-floor hallway and saw her half-falling through a door under the  jagged skylight.\n\n\n Wayne took his time. He knew how she felt waiting in there, listening  to his creeping, implacable footfalls.\n\n\n Then he yelled and slammed open the door.\n\n\n Dust and stench, filth so awful it made nothing of the dust. In  the corner he saw something hardly to be called a bed. More like  a nest. A dirty, lumpy pile of torn mattress, felt, excelsior,  shredded newspapers and rags. It seemed to crawl a little under the  moon-streaming skylight.\n\n\n She crouched in the corner panting. He took his time moving in. He  snickered as he flashed the switchblade and circled it like a serpent's  tongue. He watched what was left of her nerves go to pieces like rotten  cloth. \"Do it quick, hunter,\" she whispered. \"Please do it quick.\"\n\n\n \"What's that, baby?\"\n\n\n \"I'm tired running. Kill me first. Beat me after. They won't know the  difference.\"\n\n\n \"I'm gonna bruise and beat you,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Kill me first,\" she begged. \"I don't want\u2014\" She began to cry. She  cried right up in his face, her wide eyes unblinking, and her mouth  open.\n\n\n \"You got bad blood, baby,\" he snarled. He laughed but it didn't sound  like him and something was wrong with his belly. It was knotting up.\n\n\n \"Bad, I know! So get it over with, please. Hurry, hurry.\"\n\n\n She was small and white and quivering. She moaned but kept staring up  at him.\n\n\n He ripped off his rivet-studded belt and swung once, then groaned and  shuffled away from her.\n\n\n He kept backing toward the door. She crawled after him, begging and  clutching with both arms as she wriggled forward on her knees.\n\n\n \"Don't run. Please. Kill me! It'll be someone else if you don't. Oh,  God, I'm so tired waiting and running!\"\n\n\n \"I can't,\" he said, and sickness soured in his throat.\n\n\n \"Please.\"\n\n\n \"I can't, I can't!\"\n\n\n He turned and ran blindly, half-fell down the cracking stairs. Doctor Burns, head of the readjustment staff at the Youth Center,  studied Wayne with abstract interest.\n\n\n \"You enjoyed the hunt, Seton? You got your kicks?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But you couldn't execute them?\"\n\n\n \"No, sir.\"\n\n\n \"They're undesirables. Incurables. You know that, Seton?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"The psycho you only wounded. He's a five-times murderer. And that girl  killed her father when she was twelve. You realize there's nothing can  be done for them? That they have to be executed?\"\n\n\n \"I know.\"\n\n\n \"Too bad,\" the doctor said. \"We all have aggressive impulses, primitive  needs that must be expressed early, purged. There's murder in all  of us, Seton. The impulse shouldn't be denied or suppressed, but educated . The state used to kill them. Isn't it better all around,  Seton, for us to do it, as part of growing up? What was the matter,  Seton?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014felt sorry for her.\"\n\n\n \"Is that all you can say about it?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n The doctor pressed a buzzer. Two men in white coats entered.\n\n\n \"You should have got it out of your system, Seton, but now it's still  in there. I can't turn you out and have it erupt later\u2014and maybe shed  clean innocent blood, can I?\"\n\n\n \"No, sir,\" Wayne mumbled. He didn't look up. \"I'm sorry I punked out.\"\n\n\n \"Give him the treatment,\" the doctor said wearily. \"And send him back  to his mother.\"\n\n\n Wayne nodded and they led him away. His mind screamed still to split  open some prison of bone and lay bare and breathing wide. But there  was no way out for the trapped. Now he knew about the old man and his  poker-playing pals.\n\n\n They had all punked out.\n\n\n Like him. ",

            "speech": "Wayne's laughter, which seems to suggest a joy in violence, is actually a manifestation of his own internal struggle. He's a teenager who is forced to participate in a program that trains him to kill. While he initially enjoys the thrill of the hunt, he becomes conflicted when he's faced with the reality of taking a life. He's a reluctant killer, and his laughter is a way of coping with the emotional turmoil. He even admits to feeling sorry for his victim, and is unable to go through with the kill. This shows that his laughter is not indicative of a heartless killer, but rather a complex and conflicted individual. \n\nIt's also important to note that Wayne's laughter is not a constant thing. He only laughs when he's hunting, and even then, it's not a continuous thing. The instances where he's hunting, he's not laughing the whole time, but rather in bursts. This shows that his laughter is not something he's in control of, but rather a reaction to his emotions. It's not a joyful response to violence, but rather a coping mechanism. \n\nOverall, Wayne's laughter is not a sign of a heartless killer, but rather a reflection of his internal struggle. It's not something he's in control of, but rather a reaction to his emotions. His laughter is not constant, and the times he does laugh, it's not a joyful response, but rather a coping mechanism. He's conflicted and unsure of himself",

And kids had a\n\n right to grow up\u2014some of them!\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1962.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Wayne, unseen, sneered down from the head of the stairs.\n\n\n The old man with his thick neck, thick cigar, evening highball, potgut  and bald head without a brain in it. His slim mother with nervously  polite smiles and voice fluttering, assuring the old man by her frailty  that he was big in the world. They were squareheads one and all,  marking moron time in a gray dream. Man, was he glad to break out.\n\n\n The old man said, \"He'll be okay. Let him alone.\"\n\n\n \"But he won't eat. Just lies there all the time.\"\n\n\n \"Hell,\" the old man said. \"Sixteen's a bad time. School over, waiting  for the draft and all. He's in between. It's rough.\"\n\n\n Mother clasped her forearms and shook her head once slowly.\n\n\n \"We got to let him go, Eva. It's a dangerous time. You got to remember  about all these dangerous repressed impulses piling up with nowhere to  go, like they say. You read the books.\"\n\n\n \"But he's unhappy.\"\n\n\n \"Are we specialists? That's the Youth Board's headache, ain't it? What  do we know about adolescent trauma and like that? Now get dressed or  we'll be late.\"\n\n\n Wayne watched the ritual, grinning. He listened to their purposeless  noises, their blabbing and yakking as if they had something to say.  Blab-blab about the same old bones, and end up chewing them in the  same old ways. Then they begin all over again. A freak sideshow all the  way to nowhere. Squareheads going around either unconscious or with  eyes looking dead from the millennium in the office waiting to retire  into limbo.\n\n\n How come he'd been stuck with parental images like that? One  thing\u2014when he was jockeying a rocket to Mars or maybe firing the pants  off Asiatic reds in some steamy gone jungle paradise, he'd forget his  punkie origins in teeveeland.\n\n\n But the old man was right on for once about the dangerous repressed  impulses. Wayne had heard about it often enough. Anyway there was no  doubt about it when every move he made was a restrained explosion.  So he'd waited in his room, and it wasn't easy sweating it out alone  waiting for the breakout call from HQ.\n\n\n \"Well, dear, if you say so,\" Mother said, with the old resigned sigh  that must make the old man feel like Superman with a beerbelly.\n\n\n They heard Wayne slouching loosely down the stairs and looked up.\n\n\n \"Relax,\" Wayne said. \"You're not going anywhere tonight.\"\n\n\n \"What, son?\" his old man said uneasily. \"Sure we are. We're going to  the movies.\"\n\n\n He could feel them watching him, waiting; and yet still he didn't  answer. Somewhere out in suburban grayness a dog barked, then was  silent.\n\n\n \"Okay, go,\" Wayne said. \"If you wanta walk. I'm taking the family  boltbucket.\"\n\n\n \"But we promised the Clemons, dear,\" his mother said.\n\n\n \"Hell,\" Wayne said, grinning straight into the old man. \"I just got my  draft call.\"\n\n\n He saw the old man's Adam's apple move. \"Oh, my dear boy,\" Mother cried  out.\n\n\n \"So gimme the keys,\" Wayne said. The old man handed the keys over. His  understanding smile was strained, and fear flicked in his sagging eyes.\n\n\n \"Do be careful, dear,\" his mother said. She ran toward him as he  laughed and shut the door on her. He was still laughing as he whoomed  the Olds between the pale dead glow of houses and roared up the ramp  onto the Freeway. Ahead was the promising glitter of adventure-calling  neon, and he looked up at the high skies of night and his eyes sailed  the glaring wonders of escape. He burned off some rubber finding a slot in the park-lot. He strode  under a sign reading Public Youth Center No. 947 and walked casually  to the reception desk, where a thin man with sergeant's stripes and a  pansy haircut looked out of a pile of paperwork.\n\n\n \"Where you think you're going, my pretty lad?\"\n\n\n Wayne grinned down. \"Higher I hope than a typewriter jockey.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" the sergeant said. \"How tough we are this evening. You have a  pass, killer?\"\n\n\n \"Wayne Seton. Draft call.\"\n\n\n \"Oh.\" The sergeant checked his name off a roster and nodded. He wrote  on a slip of paper, handed the pass to Wayne. \"Go to the Armory and  check out whatever your lusting little heart desires. Then report to  Captain Jack, room 307.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, sarge dear,\" Wayne said and took the elevator up to the Armory.\n\n\n A tired fat corporal with a naked head blinked up at tall Wayne.  Finally he said, \"So make up your mind, bud. Think you're the only kid  breaking out tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Hold your teeth, pop,\" Wayne said, coolly and slowly lighting a  cigarette. \"I've decided.\"\n\n\n The corporal's little eyes studied Wayne with malicious amusement.  \"Take it from a vet, bud. Sooner you go the better. It's a big city and  you're starting late. You can get a cat, not a mouse, and some babes  are clever hellcats in a dark alley.\"\n\n\n \"You must be a genius,\" Wayne said. \"A corporal with no hair and still  a counterboy. I'm impressed. I'm all ears, Dad.\"\n\n\n The corporal sighed wearily. \"You can get that balloon head  ventilated, bud, and good.\"\n\n\n Wayne's mouth twitched. He leaned across the counter toward the  shelves and racks of weapons. \"I'll remember that crack when I get  my commission.\" He blew smoke in the corporal's face. \"Bring me a  Smith and Wesson .38, shoulder holster with spring-clip. And throw in  a Skelly switchblade for kicks\u2014the six-inch disguised job with the  double springs.\"\n\n\n The corporal waddled back with the revolver and the switchblade  disguised in a leather comb case. He checked them on a receipt ledger,  while Wayne examined the weapons, broke open the revolver, twirled the  cylinder and pushed cartridges into the waiting chamber. He slipped  the knife from the comb case, flicked open the blade and stared at its  gleam in the buttery light as his mouth went dry and the refracted  incandescence of it trickled on his brain like melted ice, exciting and  scary.\n\n\n He removed his leather jacket. He slung the holster under his left  armpit and tested the spring clip release several times, feeling the  way the serrated butt dropped into his wet palm. He put his jacket  back on and the switchblade case in his pocket. He walked toward the  elevator and didn't look back as the corporal said, \"Good luck, tiger.\"\n\n\n Captain Jack moved massively. The big stone-walled office, alive with  stuffed lion and tiger and gunracks, seemed to grow smaller. Captain  Jack crossed black-booted legs and whacked a cane at the floor. It had  a head shaped like a grinning bear.\n\n\n Wayne felt the assured smile die on his face. Something seemed to  shrink him. If he didn't watch himself he'd begin feeling like a pea  among bowling balls.\n\n\n Contemptuously amused little eyes glittered at Wayne from a shaggy  head. Shoulders hunched like stuffed sea-bags.\n\n\n \"Wayne Seton,\" said Captain Jack as if he were discussing something  in a bug collection. \"Well, well, you're really fired up aren't you?  Really going out to eat 'em. Right, punk?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said. He ran wet hands down the sides of his chinos.  His legs seemed sheathed in lead as he bit inwardly at shrinking fear  the way a dog snaps at a wound. You big overblown son, he thought, I'll  show you but good who is a punk. They made a guy wait and sweat until  he screamed. They kept a guy on the fire until desire leaped in him,  ran and billowed and roared until his brain was filled with it. But  that wasn't enough. If this muscle-bound creep was such a big boy,  what was he doing holding down a desk?\n\n\n \"Well, this is it, punk. You go the distance or start a butterfly  collection.\"\n\n\n The cane darted up. A blade snicked from the end and stopped an inch  from Wayne's nose. He jerked up a shaky hand involuntarily and clamped  a knuckle-ridged gag to his gasping mouth.\n\n\n Captain Jack chuckled. \"All right, superboy.\" He handed Wayne his  passcard. \"Curfew's off, punk, for 6 hours. You got 6 hours to make  out.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"Your beast is primed and waiting at the Four Aces Club on the West  Side. Know where that is, punk?\"\n\n\n \"No, sir, but I'll find it fast.\"\n\n\n \"Sure you will, punk,\" smiled Captain Jack. \"She'll be wearing yellow  slacks and a red shirt. Black hair, a cute trick. She's with a hefty  psycho who eats punks for breakfast. He's butchered five people.  They're both on top of the Undesirable list, Seton. They got to go and  they're your key to the stars.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said.\n\n\n \"So run along and make out, punk,\" grinned Captain Jack. A copcar stopped Wayne as he started over the bridge, out of bright  respectable neon into the murky westside slum over the river.\n\n\n Wayne waved the pass card, signed by Captain Jack, under the cop's  quivering nose. The cop shivered and stepped back and waved him on. The  Olds roared over the bridge as the night's rain blew away.\n\n\n The air through the open window was chill and damp coming from  Slumville, but Wayne felt a cold that wasn't of the night or the wind.  He turned off into a rat's warren of the inferiors. Lights turned pale,  secretive and sparse, the uncared-for streets became rough with pitted  potholes, narrow and winding and humid with wet unpleasant smells.  Wayne's fearful exhilaration increased as he cruised with bated breath  through the dark mazes of streets and rickety tenements crawling with  the shadows of mysterious promise.\n\n\n He found the alley, dark, a gloom-dripping tunnel. He drove cautiously  into it and rolled along, watching. His belly ached with expectancy as  he spotted the sick-looking dab of neon wanly sparkling. FOUR ACES CLUB He parked across the alley. He got out and stood in shadows, digging  the sultry beat of a combo, the wild pulse of drums and spinning brass  filtering through windows painted black.\n\n\n He breathed deep, started over, ducked back. A stewbum weaved out of  a bank of garbage cans, humming to himself, pulling at a rainsoaked  shirt clinging to a pale stick body. He reminded Wayne of a slim grub  balanced on one end.\n\n\n The stewbum stumbled. His bearded face in dim breaking moonlight had  a dirty, greenish tinge as he sensed Wayne there. He turned in a  grotesque uncoordinated jiggling and his eyes were wide with terror and  doom.\n\n\n \"I gotta hide, kid. They're on me.\"\n\n\n Wayne's chest rose and his hands curled.\n\n\n The bum's fingers drew at the air like white talons.\n\n\n \"Help me, kid.\"\n\n\n He turned with a scratchy cry and retreated before the sudden blast  of headlights from a Cad bulleting into the alley. The Cad rushed  past Wayne and he felt the engine-hot fumes against his legs. Tires  squealed. The Cad stopped and a teener in black jacket jumped out and  crouched as he began stalking the old rummy.\n\n\n \"This is him! This is him all right,\" the teener yelled, and one hand  came up swinging a baseball bat.\n\n\n A head bobbed out of the Cad window and giggled.\n\n\n The fumble-footed rummy tried to run and plopped on wet pavement. The  teener moved in, while a faint odor of burnt rubber hovered in the air  as the Cad cruised in a slow follow-up.\n\n\n Wayne's breath quickened as he watched, feeling somehow blank wonder  at finding himself there, free and breaking out at last with no curfew  and no law but his own. He felt as though he couldn't stop anything.  Living seemed directionless, but he still would go with it regardless,  until something dropped off or blew to hell like a hot light-bulb. He  held his breath, waiting. His body was tensed and rigid as he moved in  spirit with the hunting teener, an omniscient shadow with a hunting  license and a ghetto jungle twenty miles deep.\n\n\n The crawling stewbum screamed as the baseball bat whacked. The teener  laughed. Wayne wanted to shout. He opened his mouth, but the yell  clogged up somewhere, so that he remained soundless yet with his mouth  still open as he heard the payoff thuds where the useless wino curled  up with stick arms over his rheumy face.\n\n\n The teener laughed, tossed the bat away and began jumping up and down  with his hobnailed, mail-order air force boots. Then he ran into the  Cad. A hootch bottle soared out, made a brittle tink-tink of falling  glass.\n\n\n \"Go, man!\"\n\n\n The Cad wooshed by. It made a sort of hollow sucking noise as it  bounced over the old man twice. Then the finlights diminished like  bright wind-blown sparks.\n\n\n Wayne walked over and sneered down at the human garbage lying in  scummed rain pools. The smell of raw violence, the scent of blood, made  his heart thump like a trapped rubber ball in a cage.\n\n\n He hurried into the Four Aces, drawn by an exhilarating vision ... and  pursued by the hollow haunting fears of his own desires. He walked through the wavering haze of smoke and liquored dizziness and  stood until his eyes learned the dark. He spotted her red shirt and  yellow legs over in the corner above a murky lighted table.\n\n\n He walked toward her, watching her little subhuman pixie face lift.  The eyes widened with exciting terror, turned even paler behind a red  slash of sensuous mouth. Briefed and waiting, primed and eager for  running, she recognized her pursuer at once. He sat at a table near  her, watching and grinning and seeing her squirm.\n\n\n She sat in that slightly baffled, fearful and uncomprehending attitude  of being motionless, as though they were all actors performing in a  weirdo drama being staged in that smoky thick-aired dive.\n\n\n Wayne smiled with wry superiority at the redheaded psycho in a dirty  T-shirt, a big bruiser with a gorilla face. He was tussling his mouse  heavy.\n\n\n \"What's yours, teener?\" the slug-faced waiter asked.\n\n\n \"Bring me a Crusher, buddyroo,\" Wayne said, and flashed his pass card.\n\n\n \"Sure, teener.\"\n\n\n Red nuzzled the mouse's neck and made drooly noises. Wayne watched and  fed on the promising terror and helplessness of her hunted face. She  sat rigid, eyes fixed on Wayne like balls of frozen glass.\n\n\n Red looked up and stared straight at Wayne with eyes like black buttons  imbedded in the waxlike skin of his face. Then he grinned all on one  side. One huge hand scratched across the wet table top like a furious  cat's.\n\n\n Wayne returned the challenging move but felt a nervous twitch jerk at  his lips. A numbness covered his brain like a film as he concentrated  on staring down Red the psycho. But Red kept looking, his eyes bright  but dead. Then he began struggling it up again with the scared little  mouse.\n\n\n The waiter sat the Crusher down. Wayne signed a chit; tonight he was in  the pay of the state.\n\n\n \"What else, teener?\"\n\n\n \"One thing. Fade.\"\n\n\n \"Sure, teener,\" the waiter said, his breathy words dripping like syrup.\n\n\n Wayne drank. Liquored heat dripped into his stomach. Fire tickled his  veins, became hot wire twisting in his head.\n\n\n He drank again and forced out a shaky breath. The jazz beat thumped  fast and muted brass moaned. Drumpulse, stabbing trumpet raped the  air. Tension mounted as Wayne watched her pale throat convulsing, the  white eyelids fluttering. Red fingered at her legs and salivated at her  throat, glancing now and then at Wayne, baiting him good.\n\n\n \"Okay, you creep,\" Wayne said.\n\n\n He stood up and started through the haze. The psycho leaped and a table  crashed. Wayne's .38 dropped from its spring-clip holster and the blast  filled the room. The psycho screamed and stumbled toward the door  holding something in. The mouse darted by, eluded Wayne's grasp and was  out the door.\n\n\n Wayne went out after her in a laughing frenzy of release. He felt the  cold strange breath of moist air on his sweating skin as he sprinted  down the alley into a wind full of blowing wet.\n\n\n He ran laughing under the crazy starlight and glimpsed her now and  then, fading in and out of shadows, jumping, crawling, running with the  life-or-death animation of a wild deer.\n\n\n Up and down alleys, a rat's maze. A rabbit run. Across vacant lots.  Through shattered tenement ruins. Over a fence. There she was, falling,  sliding down a brick shute.\n\n\n He gained. He moved up. His labored breath pumped more fire. And her  scream was a rejuvenation hypo in his blood. She quivered above him on the stoop, panting, her eyes afire with  terror.\n\n\n \"You, baby,\" Wayne gasped. \"I gotcha.\"\n\n\n She backed into darkness, up there against the sagging tenement wall,  her arms out and poised like crippled wings. Wayne crept up. She gave  a squeaking sob, turned, ran. Wayne leaped into gloom. Wood cracked.  He clambered over rotten lumber. The doorway sagged and he hesitated  in the musty dark. A few feet away was the sound of loose trickling  plaster, a whimpering whine.\n\n\n \"No use running,\" Wayne said. \"Go loose. Give, baby. Give now.\"\n\n\n She scurried up sagging stairs. Wayne laughed and dug up after her,  feeling his way through debris. Dim moonlight filtered through a  sagging stairway from a shattered skylight three floors up. The mouse's  shadow floated ahead.\n\n\n He started up. The entire stair structure canted sickeningly. A railing  ripped and he nearly went with it back down to the first floor. He  heard a scream as rotten boards crumbled and dust exploded from  cracks. A rat ran past Wayne and fell into space. He burst into the  third-floor hallway and saw her half-falling through a door under the  jagged skylight.\n\n\n Wayne took his time. He knew how she felt waiting in there, listening  to his creeping, implacable footfalls.\n\n\n Then he yelled and slammed open the door.\n\n\n Dust and stench, filth so awful it made nothing of the dust. In  the corner he saw something hardly to be called a bed. More like  a nest. A dirty, lumpy pile of torn mattress, felt, excelsior,  shredded newspapers and rags. It seemed to crawl a little under the  moon-streaming skylight.\n\n\n She crouched in the corner panting. He took his time moving in. He  snickered as he flashed the switchblade and circled it like a serpent's  tongue. He watched what was left of her nerves go to pieces like rotten  cloth. \"Do it quick, hunter,\" she whispered. \"Please do it quick.\"\n\n\n \"What's that, baby?\"\n\n\n \"I'm tired running. Kill me first. Beat me after. They won't know the  difference.\"\n\n\n \"I'm gonna bruise and beat you,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Kill me first,\" she begged. \"I don't want\u2014\" She began to cry. She  cried right up in his face, her wide eyes unblinking, and her mouth  open.\n\n\n \"You got bad blood, baby,\" he snarled. He laughed but it didn't sound  like him and something was wrong with his belly. It was knotting up.\n\n\n \"Bad, I know! So get it over with, please. Hurry, hurry.\"\n\n\n She was small and white and quivering. She moaned but kept staring up  at him.\n\n\n He ripped off his rivet-studded belt and swung once, then groaned and  shuffled away from her.\n\n\n He kept backing toward the door. She crawled after him, begging and  clutching with both arms as she wriggled forward on her knees.\n\n\n \"Don't run. Please. Kill me! It'll be someone else if you don't. Oh,  God, I'm so tired waiting and running!\"\n\n\n \"I can't,\" he said, and sickness soured in his throat.\n\n\n \"Please.\"\n\n\n \"I can't, I can't!\"\n\n\n He turned and ran blindly, half-fell down the cracking stairs. Doctor Burns, head of the readjustment staff at the Youth Center,  studied Wayne with abstract interest.\n\n\n \"You enjoyed the hunt, Seton? You got your kicks?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But you couldn't execute them?\"\n\n\n \"No, sir.\"\n\n\n \"They're undesirables. Incurables. You know that, Seton?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"The psycho you only wounded. He's a five-times murderer. And that girl  killed her father when she was twelve. You realize there's nothing can  be done for them? That they have to be executed?\"\n\n\n \"I know.\"\n\n\n \"Too bad,\" the doctor said. \"We all have aggressive impulses, primitive  needs that must be expressed early, purged. There's murder in all  of us, Seton. The impulse shouldn't be denied or suppressed, but educated . The state used to kill them. Isn't it better all around,  Seton, for us to do it, as part of growing up? What was the matter,  Seton?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014felt sorry for her.\"\n\n\n \"Is that all you can say about it?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n The doctor pressed a buzzer. Two men in white coats entered.\n\n\n \"You should have got it out of your system, Seton, but now it's still  in there. I can't turn you out and have it erupt later\u2014and maybe shed  clean innocent blood, can I?\"\n\n\n \"No, sir,\" Wayne mumbled. He didn't look up. \"I'm sorry I punked out.\"\n\n\n \"Give him the treatment,\" the doctor said wearily. \"And send him back  to his mother.\"\n\n\n Wayne nodded and they led him away. His mind screamed still to split  open some prison of bone and lay bare and breathing wide. But there  was no way out for the trapped. Now he knew about the old man and his  poker-playing pals.\n\n\n They had all punked out.\n\n\n Like him. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is ironic about Wayne\u2019s laughing in the face of violence?\u2014First when he leaves his parents house and again when he chases Red.\u00a0\n\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"His laughs suggest he enjoys violence, but really they are a cry for help.\u00a0\n\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"His real feelings about violence are the opposite of what his maniacal laugh suggests.

The old man handed the keys over. His  understanding smile was strained, and fear flicked in his sagging eyes.\n\n\n \"Do be careful, dear,\" his mother said. She ran toward him as he  laughed and shut the door on her. He was still laughing as he whoomed  the Olds between the pale dead glow of houses and roared up the ramp  onto the Freeway. Ahead was the promising glitter of adventure-calling  neon, and he looked up at the high skies of night and his eyes sailed  the glaring wonders of escape. He burned off some rubber finding a slot in the park-lot. He strode  under a sign reading Public Youth Center No. 947 and walked casually  to the reception desk, where a thin man with sergeant's stripes and a  pansy haircut looked out of a pile of paperwork.\n\n\n \"Where you think you're going, my pretty lad?\"\n\n\n Wayne grinned down. \"Higher I hope than a typewriter jockey.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" the sergeant said. \"How tough we are this evening. You have a  pass, killer?\"\n\n\n \"Wayne Seton. Draft call.\"\n\n\n \"Oh.\" The sergeant checked his name off a roster and nodded. He wrote  on a slip of paper, handed the pass to Wayne. \"Go to the Armory and  check out whatever your lusting little heart desires. Then report to  Captain Jack, room 307.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, sarge dear,\" Wayne said and took the elevator up to the Armory.\n\n\n A tired fat corporal with a naked head blinked up at tall Wayne.  Finally he said, \"So make up your mind, bud. Think you're the only kid  breaking out tonight?\"\n\n\n \"Hold your teeth, pop,\" Wayne said, coolly and slowly lighting a  cigarette. \"I've decided.\"\n\n\n The corporal's little eyes studied Wayne with malicious amusement.  \"Take it from a vet, bud. Sooner you go the better. It's a big city and  you're starting late. You can get a cat, not a mouse, and some babes  are clever hellcats in a dark alley.\"\n\n\n \"You must be a genius,\" Wayne said. \"A corporal with no hair and still  a counterboy. I'm impressed. I'm all ears, Dad.\"\n\n\n The corporal sighed wearily. \"You can get that balloon head  ventilated, bud, and good.\"\n\n\n Wayne's mouth twitched. He leaned across the counter toward the  shelves and racks of weapons. \"I'll remember that crack when I get  my commission.\" He blew smoke in the corporal's face. \"Bring me a  Smith and Wesson .38, shoulder holster with spring-clip. And throw in  a Skelly switchblade for kicks\u2014the six-inch disguised job with the  double springs.\"\n\n\n The corporal waddled back with the revolver and the switchblade  disguised in a leather comb case. He checked them on a receipt ledger,  while Wayne examined the weapons, broke open the revolver, twirled the  cylinder and pushed cartridges into the waiting chamber. He slipped  the knife from the comb case, flicked open the blade and stared at its  gleam in the buttery light as his mouth went dry and the refracted  incandescence of it trickled on his brain like melted ice, exciting and  scary.\n\n\n He removed his leather jacket. He slung the holster under his left  armpit and tested the spring clip release several times, feeling the  way the serrated butt dropped into his wet palm. He put his jacket  back on and the switchblade case in his pocket. He walked toward the  elevator and didn't look back as the corporal said, \"Good luck, tiger.\"\n\n\n Captain Jack moved massively. The big stone-walled office, alive with  stuffed lion and tiger and gunracks, seemed to grow smaller. Captain  Jack crossed black-booted legs and whacked a cane at the floor. It had  a head shaped like a grinning bear.\n\n\n Wayne felt the assured smile die on his face. Something seemed to  shrink him. If he didn't watch himself he'd begin feeling like a pea  among bowling balls.\n\n\n Contemptuously amused little eyes glittered at Wayne from a shaggy  head. Shoulders hunched like stuffed sea-bags.\n\n\n \"Wayne Seton,\" said Captain Jack as if he were discussing something  in a bug collection. \"Well, well, you're really fired up aren't you?  Really going out to eat 'em. Right, punk?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said. He ran wet hands down the sides of his chinos.  His legs seemed sheathed in lead as he bit inwardly at shrinking fear  the way a dog snaps at a wound. You big overblown son, he thought, I'll  show you but good who is a punk. They made a guy wait and sweat until  he screamed. They kept a guy on the fire until desire leaped in him,  ran and billowed and roared until his brain was filled with it. But  that wasn't enough. If this muscle-bound creep was such a big boy,  what was he doing holding down a desk?\n\n\n \"Well, this is it, punk. You go the distance or start a butterfly  collection.\"\n\n\n The cane darted up. A blade snicked from the end and stopped an inch  from Wayne's nose. He jerked up a shaky hand involuntarily and clamped  a knuckle-ridged gag to his gasping mouth.\n\n\n Captain Jack chuckled. \"All right, superboy.\" He handed Wayne his  passcard. \"Curfew's off, punk, for 6 hours. You got 6 hours to make  out.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"Your beast is primed and waiting at the Four Aces Club on the West  Side. Know where that is, punk?\"\n\n\n \"No, sir, but I'll find it fast.\"\n\n\n \"Sure you will, punk,\" smiled Captain Jack. \"She'll be wearing yellow  slacks and a red shirt. Black hair, a cute trick. She's with a hefty  psycho who eats punks for breakfast. He's butchered five people.  They're both on top of the Undesirable list, Seton. They got to go and  they're your key to the stars.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Wayne said.\n\n\n \"So run along and make out, punk,\" grinned Captain Jack. A copcar stopped Wayne as he started over the bridge, out of bright  respectable neon into the murky westside slum over the river.\n\n\n Wayne waved the pass card, signed by Captain Jack, under the cop's  quivering nose. The cop shivered and stepped back and waved him on. The  Olds roared over the bridge as the night's rain blew away.\n\n\n The air through the open window was chill and damp coming from  Slumville, but Wayne felt a cold that wasn't of the night or the wind.  He turned off into a rat's warren of the inferiors. Lights turned pale,  secretive and sparse, the uncared-for streets became rough with pitted  potholes, narrow and winding and humid with wet unpleasant smells.  Wayne's fearful exhilaration increased as he cruised with bated breath  through the dark mazes of streets and rickety tenements crawling with  the shadows of mysterious promise.\n\n\n He found the alley, dark, a gloom-dripping tunnel. He drove cautiously  into it and rolled along, watching. His belly ached with expectancy as  he spotted the sick-looking dab of neon wanly sparkling. FOUR ACES CLUB He parked across the alley. He got out and stood in shadows, digging  the sultry beat of a combo, the wild pulse of drums and spinning brass  filtering through windows painted black.\n\n\n He breathed deep, started over, ducked back. A stewbum weaved out of  a bank of garbage cans, humming to himself, pulling at a rainsoaked  shirt clinging to a pale stick body. He reminded Wayne of a slim grub  balanced on one end.\n\n\n The stewbum stumbled. His bearded face in dim breaking moonlight had  a dirty, greenish tinge as he sensed Wayne there. He turned in a  grotesque uncoordinated jiggling and his eyes were wide with terror and  doom.\n\n\n \"I gotta hide, kid. They're on me.\"\n\n\n Wayne's chest rose and his hands curled.\n\n\n The bum's fingers drew at the air like white talons.\n\n\n \"Help me, kid.\"\n\n\n He turned with a scratchy cry and retreated before the sudden blast  of headlights from a Cad bulleting into the alley. The Cad rushed  past Wayne and he felt the engine-hot fumes against his legs. Tires  squealed. The Cad stopped and a teener in black jacket jumped out and  crouched as he began stalking the old rummy.\n\n\n \"This is him! This is him all right,\" the teener yelled, and one hand  came up swinging a baseball bat.\n\n\n A head bobbed out of the Cad window and giggled.\n\n\n The fumble-footed rummy tried to run and plopped on wet pavement. The  teener moved in, while a faint odor of burnt rubber hovered in the air  as the Cad cruised in a slow follow-up.\n\n\n Wayne's breath quickened as he watched, feeling somehow blank wonder  at finding himself there, free and breaking out at last with no curfew  and no law but his own. He felt as though he couldn't stop anything.  Living seemed directionless, but he still would go with it regardless,  until something dropped off or blew to hell like a hot light-bulb. He  held his breath, waiting. His body was tensed and rigid as he moved in  spirit with the hunting teener, an omniscient shadow with a hunting  license and a ghetto jungle twenty miles deep.\n\n\n The crawling stewbum screamed as the baseball bat whacked. The teener  laughed. Wayne wanted to shout. He opened his mouth, but the yell  clogged up somewhere, so that he remained soundless yet with his mouth  still open as he heard the payoff thuds where the useless wino curled  up with stick arms over his rheumy face.\n\n\n The teener laughed, tossed the bat away and began jumping up and down  with his hobnailed, mail-order air force boots. Then he ran into the  Cad. A hootch bottle soared out, made a brittle tink-tink of falling  glass.\n\n\n \"Go, man!\"\n\n\n The Cad wooshed by. It made a sort of hollow sucking noise as it  bounced over the old man twice. Then the finlights diminished like  bright wind-blown sparks.\n\n\n Wayne walked over and sneered down at the human garbage lying in  scummed rain pools. The smell of raw violence, the scent of blood, made  his heart thump like a trapped rubber ball in a cage.\n\n\n He hurried into the Four Aces, drawn by an exhilarating vision ... and  pursued by the hollow haunting fears of his own desires. He walked through the wavering haze of smoke and liquored dizziness and  stood until his eyes learned the dark. He spotted her red shirt and  yellow legs over in the corner above a murky lighted table.\n\n\n He walked toward her, watching her little subhuman pixie face lift.  The eyes widened with exciting terror, turned even paler behind a red  slash of sensuous mouth. Briefed and waiting, primed and eager for  running, she recognized her pursuer at once. He sat at a table near  her, watching and grinning and seeing her squirm.\n\n\n She sat in that slightly baffled, fearful and uncomprehending attitude  of being motionless, as though they were all actors performing in a  weirdo drama being staged in that smoky thick-aired dive.\n\n\n Wayne smiled with wry superiority at the redheaded psycho in a dirty  T-shirt, a big bruiser with a gorilla face. He was tussling his mouse  heavy.\n\n\n \"What's yours, teener?\" the slug-faced waiter asked.\n\n\n \"Bring me a Crusher, buddyroo,\" Wayne said, and flashed his pass card.\n\n\n \"Sure, teener.\"\n\n\n Red nuzzled the mouse's neck and made drooly noises. Wayne watched and  fed on the promising terror and helplessness of her hunted face. She  sat rigid, eyes fixed on Wayne like balls of frozen glass.\n\n\n Red looked up and stared straight at Wayne with eyes like black buttons  imbedded in the waxlike skin of his face. Then he grinned all on one  side. One huge hand scratched across the wet table top like a furious  cat's.\n\n\n Wayne returned the challenging move but felt a nervous twitch jerk at  his lips. A numbness covered his brain like a film as he concentrated  on staring down Red the psycho. But Red kept looking, his eyes bright  but dead. Then he began struggling it up again with the scared little  mouse.\n\n\n The waiter sat the Crusher down. Wayne signed a chit; tonight he was in  the pay of the state.\n\n\n \"What else, teener?\"\n\n\n \"One thing. Fade.\"\n\n\n \"Sure, teener,\" the waiter said, his breathy words dripping like syrup.\n\n\n Wayne drank. Liquored heat dripped into his stomach. Fire tickled his  veins, became hot wire twisting in his head.\n\n\n He drank again and forced out a shaky breath. The jazz beat thumped  fast and muted brass moaned. Drumpulse, stabbing trumpet raped the  air. Tension mounted as Wayne watched her pale throat convulsing, the  white eyelids fluttering. Red fingered at her legs and salivated at her  throat, glancing now and then at Wayne, baiting him good.\n\n\n \"Okay, you creep,\" Wayne said.\n\n\n He stood up and started through the haze. The psycho leaped and a table  crashed. Wayne's .38 dropped from its spring-clip holster and the blast  filled the room. The psycho screamed and stumbled toward the door  holding something in. The mouse darted by, eluded Wayne's grasp and was  out the door.\n\n\n Wayne went out after her in a laughing frenzy of release. He felt the  cold strange breath of moist air on his sweating skin as he sprinted  down the alley into a wind full of blowing wet.\n\n\n He ran laughing under the crazy starlight and glimpsed her now and  then, fading in and out of shadows, jumping, crawling, running with the  life-or-death animation of a wild deer.\n\n\n Up and down alleys, a rat's maze. A rabbit run. Across vacant lots.  Through shattered tenement ruins. Over a fence. There she was, falling,  sliding down a brick shute.\n\n\n He gained. He moved up. His labored breath pumped more fire. And her  scream was a rejuvenation hypo in his blood. She quivered above him on the stoop, panting, her eyes afire with  terror.\n\n\n \"You, baby,\" Wayne gasped. \"I gotcha.\"\n\n\n She backed into darkness, up there against the sagging tenement wall,  her arms out and poised like crippled wings. Wayne crept up. She gave  a squeaking sob, turned, ran. Wayne leaped into gloom. Wood cracked.  He clambered over rotten lumber. The doorway sagged and he hesitated  in the musty dark. A few feet away was the sound of loose trickling  plaster, a whimpering whine.\n\n\n \"No use running,\" Wayne said. \"Go loose. Give, baby. Give now.\"\n\n\n She scurried up sagging stairs. Wayne laughed and dug up after her,  feeling his way through debris. Dim moonlight filtered through a  sagging stairway from a shattered skylight three floors up. The mouse's  shadow floated ahead.\n\n\n He started up. The entire stair structure canted sickeningly. A railing  ripped and he nearly went with it back down to the first floor. He  heard a scream as rotten boards crumbled and dust exploded from  cracks. A rat ran past Wayne and fell into space. He burst into the  third-floor hallway and saw her half-falling through a door under the  jagged skylight.\n\n\n Wayne took his time. He knew how she felt waiting in there, listening  to his creeping, implacable footfalls.\n\n\n Then he yelled and slammed open the door.\n\n\n Dust and stench, filth so awful it made nothing of the dust. In  the corner he saw something hardly to be called a bed. More like  a nest. A dirty, lumpy pile of torn mattress, felt, excelsior,  shredded newspapers and rags. It seemed to crawl a little under the  moon-streaming skylight.\n\n\n She crouched in the corner panting. He took his time moving in. He  snickered as he flashed the switchblade and circled it like a serpent's  tongue. He watched what was left of her nerves go to pieces like rotten  cloth. \"Do it quick, hunter,\" she whispered. \"Please do it quick.\"\n\n\n \"What's that, baby?\"\n\n\n \"I'm tired running. Kill me first. Beat me after. They won't know the  difference.\"\n\n\n \"I'm gonna bruise and beat you,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Kill me first,\" she begged. \"I don't want\u2014\" She began to cry. She  cried right up in his face, her wide eyes unblinking, and her mouth  open.\n\n\n \"You got bad blood, baby,\" he snarled. He laughed but it didn't sound  like him and something was wrong with his belly. It was knotting up.\n\n\n \"Bad, I know! So get it over with, please. Hurry, hurry.\"\n\n\n She was small and white and quivering. She moaned but kept staring up  at him.\n\n\n He ripped off his rivet-studded belt and swung once, then groaned and  shuffled away from her.\n\n\n He kept backing toward the door. She crawled after him, begging and  clutching with both arms as she wriggled forward on her knees.\n\n\n \"Don't run. Please. Kill me! It'll be someone else if you don't. Oh,  God, I'm so tired waiting and running!\"\n\n\n \"I can't,\" he said, and sickness soured in his throat.\n\n\n \"Please.\"\n\n\n \"I can't, I can't!\"\n\n\n He turned and ran blindly, half-fell down the cracking stairs. Doctor Burns, head of the readjustment staff at the Youth Center,  studied Wayne with abstract interest.\n\n\n \"You enjoyed the hunt, Seton? You got your kicks?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"But you couldn't execute them?\"\n\n\n \"No, sir.\"\n\n\n \"They're undesirables. Incurables. You know that, Seton?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"The psycho you only wounded. He's a five-times murderer. And that girl  killed her father when she was twelve. You realize there's nothing can  be done for them? That they have to be executed?\"\n\n\n \"I know.\"\n\n\n \"Too bad,\" the doctor said. \"We all have aggressive impulses, primitive  needs that must be expressed early, purged. There's murder in all  of us, Seton. The impulse shouldn't be denied or suppressed, but educated . The state used to kill them. Isn't it better all around,  Seton, for us to do it, as part of growing up? What was the matter,  Seton?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014felt sorry for her.\"\n\n\n \"Is that all you can say about it?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n The doctor pressed a buzzer. Two men in white coats entered.\n\n\n \"You should have got it out of your system, Seton, but now it's still  in there. I can't turn you out and have it erupt later\u2014and maybe shed  clean innocent blood, can I?\"\n\n\n \"No, sir,\" Wayne mumbled. He didn't look up. \"I'm sorry I punked out.\"\n\n\n \"Give him the treatment,\" the doctor said wearily. \"And send him back  to his mother.\"\n\n\n Wayne nodded and they led him away. His mind screamed still to split  open some prison of bone and lay bare and breathing wide. But there  was no way out for the trapped. Now he knew about the old man and his  poker-playing pals.\n\n\n They had all punked out.\n\n\n Like him. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is ironic about Wayne\u2019s laughing in the face of violence?\u2014First when he leaves his parents house and again when he chases Red.\u00a0\n\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"His laughs suggest he enjoys violence, but really they are a cry for help.\u00a0\n\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"His real feelings about violence are the opposite of what his maniacal laugh suggests. It turns out he isn\u2019t a heartless killer.\u00a0\n\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"His real feelings about violence are the opposite of what his maniacal laugh suggests. It turns out he isn\u2019t a heartless killer.\u00a0\n\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"His real feelings about violence are the opposite of what his maniacal laugh suggests.
