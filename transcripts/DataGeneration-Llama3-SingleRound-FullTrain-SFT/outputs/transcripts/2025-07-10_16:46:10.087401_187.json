I\n\n\n In his room at the Elsby Commercial Hotel, Tremaine opened his luggage  and took out a small tool kit, used a screwdriver to remove the bottom  cover plate from the telephone. He inserted a tiny aluminum cylinder,  crimped wires and replaced the cover. Then he dialed a long-distance  Washington number and waited half a minute for the connection.\n\n\n \"Fred, Tremaine here. Put the buzzer on.\" A thin hum sounded on the  wire as the scrambler went into operation.\n\n\n \"Okay, can you read me all right? I'm set up in Elsby. Grammond's boys  are supposed to keep me informed. Meantime, I'm not sitting in this  damned room crouched over a dial. I'll be out and around for the rest  of the afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"I want to see results,\" the thin voice came back over the filtered  hum of the jamming device. \"You spent a week with Grammond\u2014I can't  wait another. I don't mind telling you certain quarters are pressing  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fred, when will you learn to sit on your news breaks until you've got  some answers to go with the questions?\"\n\n\n \"I'm an appointive official,\" Fred said sharply. \"But never mind  that. This fellow Margrave\u2014General Margrave. Project Officer for the  hyperwave program\u2014he's been on my neck day and night. I can't say I  blame him. An unauthorized transmitter interfering with a Top Secret  project, progress slowing to a halt, and this Bureau\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Fred. I was happy in the lab. Headaches, nightmares and all.  Hyperwave is my baby, remember? You elected me to be a leg-man: now let  me do it my way.\"\n\n\n \"I felt a technical man might succeed where a trained investigator  could be misled. And since it seems to be pinpointed in your home  area\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You don't have to justify yourself. Just don't hold out on me. I  sometimes wonder if I've seen the complete files on this\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've seen all the files! Now I want answers, not questions! I'm  warning you, Tremaine. Get that transmitter. I need someone to hang!\" Tremaine left the hotel, walked two blocks west along Commerce Street  and turned in at a yellow brick building with the words ELSBY  MUNICIPAL POLICE cut in the stone lintel above the door. Inside, a  heavy man with a creased face and thick gray hair looked up from behind  an ancient Underwood. He studied Tremaine, shifted a toothpick to the  opposite corner of his mouth.\n\n\n \"Don't I know you, mister?\" he said. His soft voice carried a note of  authority.\n\n\n Tremaine took off his hat. \"Sure you do, Jess. It's been a while,  though.\"\n\n\n The policeman got to his feet. \"Jimmy,\" he said, \"Jimmy Tremaine.\" He  came to the counter and put out his hand. \"How are you, Jimmy? What  brings you back to the boondocks?\"\n\n\n \"Let's go somewhere and sit down, Jess.\"\n\n\n In a back room Tremaine said, \"To everybody but you this is just a  visit to the old home town. Between us, there's more.\"\n\n\n Jess nodded. \"I heard you were with the guv'ment.\"\n\n\n \"It won't take long to tell; we don't know much yet.\" Tremaine covered  the discovery of the powerful unidentified interference on the  high-security hyperwave band, the discovery that each transmission  produced not one but a pattern of \"fixes\" on the point of origin. He  passed a sheet of paper across the table. It showed a set of concentric  circles, overlapped by a similar group of rings.\n\n\n \"I think what we're getting is an echo effect from each of these  points of intersection. The rings themselves represent the diffraction  pattern\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold it, Jimmy. To me it just looks like a beer ad. I'll take your  word for it.\"\n\n\n \"The point is this, Jess: we think we've got it narrowed down to this  section. I'm not sure of a damn thing, but I think that transmitter's  near here. Now, have you got any ideas?\"\n\n\n \"That's a tough one, Jimmy. This is where I should come up with the  news that Old Man Whatchamacallit's got an attic full of gear he says  is a time machine. Trouble is, folks around here haven't even taken  to TV. They figure we should be content with radio, like the Lord  intended.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't expect any easy answers, Jess. But I was hoping maybe you had  something ...\"\n\n\n \"Course,\" said Jess, \"there's always Mr. Bram ...\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Bram,\" repeated Tremaine. \"Is he still around? I remember him as a  hundred years old when I was kid.\"\n\n\n \"Still just the same, Jimmy. Comes in town maybe once a week, buys his  groceries and hikes back out to his place by the river.\"\n\n\n \"Well, what about him?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing. But he's the town's mystery man. You know that. A little  touched in the head.\"\n\n\n \"There were a lot of funny stories about him, I remember,\" Tremaine  said. \"I always liked him. One time he tried to teach me something  I've forgotten. Wanted me to come out to his place and he'd teach me.  I never did go. We kids used to play in the caves near his place, and  sometimes he gave us apples.\" \"I've never seen any harm in Bram,\" said Jess. \"But you know how this  town is about foreigners, especially when they're a mite addled. Bram  has blue eyes and blond hair\u2014or did before it turned white\u2014and he  talks just like everybody else. From a distance he seems just like an  ordinary American. But up close, you feel it. He's foreign, all right.  But we never did know where he came from.\"\n\n\n \"How long's he lived here in Elsby?\"\n\n\n \"Beats me, Jimmy. You remember old Aunt Tress, used to know all about  ancestors and such as that? She couldn't remember about Mr. Bram. She  was kind of senile, I guess. She used to say he'd lived in that same  old place out on the Concord road when she was a girl. Well, she died  five years ago ... in her seventies. He still walks in town every  Wednesday ... or he did up till yesterday anyway.\"\n\n\n \"Oh?\" Tremaine stubbed out his cigarette, lit another. \"What happened  then?\"\n\n\n \"You remember Soup Gaskin? He's got a boy, name of Hull. He's Soup all  over again.\"\n\n\n \"I remember Soup,\" Tremaine said. \"He and his bunch used to come in  the drug store where I worked and perch on the stools and kid around  with me, and Mr. Hempleman would watch them from over back of the  prescription counter and look nervous. They used to raise cain in the  other drug store....\"\n\n\n \"Soup's been in the pen since then. His boy Hull's the same kind. Him  and a bunch of his pals went out to Bram's place one night and set it  on fire.\"\n\n\n \"What was the idea of that?\"\n\n\n \"Dunno. Just meanness, I reckon. Not much damage done. A car was  passing by and called it in. I had the whole caboodle locked up here  for six hours. Then the sob sisters went to work: poor little tyke  routine, high spirits, you know the line. All of 'em but Hull are back  in the streets playin' with matches by now. I'm waiting for the day  they'll make jail age.\"\n\n\n \"Why Bram?\" Tremaine persisted. \"As far as I know, he never had any  dealings to speak of with anybody here in town.\"\n\n\n \"Oh hoh, you're a little young, Jimmy,\" Jess chuckled. \"You never knew  about Mr. Bram\u2014the young Mr. Bram\u2014and Linda Carroll.\"\n\n\n Tremaine shook his head.\n\n\n \"Old Miss Carroll. School teacher here for years; guess she was retired  by the time you were playing hookey. But her dad had money, and in  her day she was a beauty. Too good for the fellers in these parts. I  remember her ridin by in a high-wheeled shay, when I was just a nipper.  Sitting up proud and tall, with that red hair piled up high. I used to  think she was some kind of princess....\"\n\n\n \"What about her and Bram? A romance?\" Jess rocked his chair back on two legs, looked at the ceiling,  frowning. \"This would ha' been about nineteen-oh-one. I was no more'n  eight years old. Miss Linda was maybe in her twenties\u2014and that made  her an old maid, in those times. The word got out she was setting  her cap for Bram. He was a good-looking young feller then, over six  foot, of course, broad backed, curly yellow hair\u2014and a stranger to  boot. Like I said, Linda Carroll wanted nothin to do with the local  bucks. There was a big shindy planned. Now, you know Bram was funny  about any kind of socializing; never would go any place at night. But  this was a Sunday afternoon and someways or other they got Bram down  there; and Miss Linda made her play, right there in front of the town,  practically. Just before sundown they went off together in that fancy  shay. And the next day, she was home again\u2014alone. That finished off  her reputation, as far as the biddies in Elsby was concerned. It was  ten years 'fore she even landed the teaching job. By that time, she was  already old. And nobody was ever fool enough to mention the name Bram  in front of her.\"\n\n\n Tremaine got to his feet. \"I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your ears  and eyes open for anything that might build into a lead on this, Jess.  Meantime, I'm just a tourist, seeing the sights.\"\n\n\n \"What about that gear of yours? Didn't you say you had some kind of  detector you were going to set up?\"\n\n\n \"I've got an oversized suitcase,\" Tremaine said. \"I'll be setting it up  in my room over at the hotel.\"\n\n\n \"When's this bootleg station supposed to broadcast again?\"\n\n\n \"After dark. I'm working on a few ideas. It might be an infinitely  repeating logarithmic sequence, based on\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold it, Jimmy. You're over my head.\" Jess got to his feet. \"Let me  know if you want anything. And by the way\u2014\" he winked broadly\u2014\"I  always did know who busted Soup Gaskin's nose and took out his front  teeth.\" II\n\n\n Back in the street, Tremaine headed south toward the Elsby Town  Hall, a squat structure of brownish-red brick, crouched under yellow  autumn trees at the end of Sheridan Street. Tremaine went up the  steps and past heavy double doors. Ten yards along the dim corridor,  a hand-lettered cardboard sign over a black-varnished door said  \"MUNICIPAL OFFICE OF RECORD.\" Tremaine opened the door and went in.\n\n\n A thin man with garters above the elbow looked over his shoulder at  Tremaine.\n\n\n \"We're closed,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I won't be a minute,\" Tremaine said. \"Just want to check on when the  Bram property changed hands last.\"\n\n\n The man turned to Tremaine, pushing a drawer shut with his hip. \"Bram?  He dead?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing like that. I just want to know when he bought the place.\"\n\n\n The man came over to the counter, eyeing Tremaine. \"He ain't going to  sell, mister, if that's what you want to know.\"\n\n\n \"I want to know when he bought.\"\n\n\n The man hesitated, closed his jaw hard. \"Come back tomorrow,\" he said.\n\n\n Tremaine put a hand on the counter, looked thoughtful. \"I was hoping  to save a trip.\" He lifted his hand and scratched the side of his jaw.  A folded bill opened on the counter. The thin man's eyes darted toward  it. His hand eased out, covered the bill. He grinned quickly.\n\n\n \"See what I can do,\" he said.\n\n\n It was ten minutes before he beckoned Tremaine over to the table where  a two-foot-square book lay open. An untrimmed fingernail indicated a  line written in faded ink:\n\n\n \"May 19. Acreage sold, One Dollar and other G&amp;V consid. NW Quarter  Section 24, Township Elsby. Bram. (see Vol. 9 &amp; cet.)\"\n\n\n \"Translated, what does that mean?\" said Tremaine.\n\n\n \"That's the ledger for 1901; means Bram bought a quarter section on the  nineteenth of May. You want me to look up the deed?\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks,\" Tremaine said. \"That's all I needed.\" He turned back to  the door.\n\n\n \"What's up, mister?\" the clerk called after him. \"Bram in some kind of  trouble?\"\n\n\n \"No. No trouble.\"\n\n\n The man was looking at the book with pursed lips. \"Nineteen-oh-one,\"  he said. \"I never thought of it before, but you know, old Bram must be  dern near to ninety years old. Spry for that age.\"\n\n\n \"I guess you're right.\"\n\n\n The clerk looked sideways at Tremaine. \"Lots of funny stories about  old Bram. Useta say his place was haunted. You know; funny noises and  lights. And they used to say there was money buried out at his place.\"\n\n\n \"I've heard those stories. Just superstition, wouldn't you say?\"\n\n\n \"Maybe so.\" The clerk leaned on the counter, assumed a knowing look.  \"There's one story that's not superstition....\"\n\n\n Tremaine waited.\n\n\n \"You\u2014uh\u2014paying anything for information?\"\n\n\n \"Now why would I do that?\" Tremaine reached for the door knob.\n\n\n The clerk shrugged. \"Thought I'd ask. Anyway\u2014I can swear to this.  Nobody in this town's ever seen Bram between sundown and sunup.\" Untrimmed sumacs threw late-afternoon shadows on the discolored stucco  facade of the Elsby Public Library. Inside, Tremaine followed a  paper-dry woman of indeterminate age to a rack of yellowed newsprint.\n\n\n \"You'll find back to nineteen-forty here,\" the librarian said. \"The  older are there in the shelves.\"\n\n\n \"I want nineteen-oh-one, if they go back that far.\"\n\n\n The woman darted a suspicious look at Tremaine. \"You have to handle  these old papers carefully.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be extremely careful.\" The woman sniffed, opened a drawer, leafed  through it, muttering.\n\n\n \"What date was it you wanted?\"\n\n\n \"Nineteen-oh-one; the week of May nineteenth.\"\n\n\n The librarian pulled out a folded paper, placed it on the table,  adjusted her glasses, squinted at the front page. \"That's it,\" she  said. \"These papers keep pretty well, provided they're stored in the  dark. But they're still flimsy, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'll remember.\" The woman stood by as Tremaine looked over the front  page. The lead article concerned the opening of the Pan-American  Exposition at Buffalo. Vice-President Roosevelt had made a speech.  Tremaine leafed over, reading slowly.\n\n\n On page four, under a column headed County Notes he saw the name Bram:\n\n\n Mr. Bram has purchased a quarter section of fine grazing land,  north of town, together with a sturdy house, from J. P. Spivey of  Elsby. Mr. Bram will occupy the home and will continue to graze a  few head of stock. Mr. Bram, who is a newcomer to the county, has  been a resident of Mrs. Stoate's Guest Home in Elsby for the past  months.\n\n\n \"May I see some earlier issues; from about the first of the year?\"\n\n\n The librarian produced the papers. Tremaine turned the pages, read the  heads, skimmed an article here and there. The librarian went back to  her desk. An hour later, in the issue for July 7, 1900, an item caught  his eye:\n\n\n A Severe Thunderstorm. Citizens of Elsby and the country were much  alarmed by a violent cloudburst, accompanied by lightning and  thunder, during the night of the fifth. A fire set in the pine  woods north of Spivey's farm destroyed a considerable amount of  timber and threatened the house before burning itself out along  the river.\n\n\n The librarian was at Tremaine's side. \"I have to close the library now.  You'll have to come back tomorrow.\"\n\n\n Outside, the sky was sallow in the west: lights were coming on in  windows along the side streets. Tremaine turned up his collar against a  cold wind that had risen, started along the street toward the hotel.\n\n\n A block away a black late-model sedan rounded a corner with a faint  squeal of tires and gunned past him, a heavy antenna mounted forward  of the left rear tail fin whipping in the slipstream. Tremaine stopped  short, stared after the car.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" he said aloud. An elderly man veered, eyeing him sharply.  Tremaine set off at a run, covered the two blocks to the hotel, yanked  open the door to his car, slid into the seat, made a U-turn, and headed  north after the police car. Two miles into the dark hills north of the Elsby city limits, Tremaine  rounded a curve. The police car was parked on the shoulder beside the  highway just ahead. He pulled off the road ahead of it and walked back.  The door opened. A tall figure stepped out.\n\n\n \"What's your problem, mister?\" a harsh voice drawled.\n\n\n \"What's the matter? Run out of signal?\"\n\n\n \"What's it to you, mister?\"\n\n\n \"Are you boys in touch with Grammond on the car set?\"\n\n\n \"We could be.\"\n\n\n \"Mind if I have a word with him? My name's Tremaine.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the cop, \"you're the big shot from Washington.\" He shifted  chewing tobacco to the other side of his jaw. \"Sure, you can talk to  him.\" He turned and spoke to the other cop, who muttered into the mike  before handing it to Tremaine.\n\n\n The heavy voice of the State Police chief crackled. \"What's your beef,  Tremaine?\"\n\n\n \"I thought you were going to keep your men away from Elsby until I gave  the word, Grammond.\"\n\n\n \"That was before I knew your Washington stuffed shirts were holding out  on me.\"\n\n\n \"It's nothing we can go to court with, Grammond. And the job you were  doing might have been influenced if I'd told you about the Elsby angle.\"\n\n\n Grammond cursed. \"I could have put my men in the town and taken it  apart brick by brick in the time\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's just what I don't want. If our bird sees cops cruising, he'll  go underground.\"\n\n\n \"You've got it all figured, I see. I'm just the dumb hick you boys use  for the spade work, that it?\"\n\n\n \"Pull your lip back in. You've given me the confirmation I needed.\"\n\n\n \"Confirmation, hell! All I know is that somebody somewhere is punching  out a signal. For all I know, it's forty midgets on bicycles, pedalling  all over the damned state. I've got fixes in every county\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The smallest hyperwave transmitter Uncle Sam knows how to build weighs  three tons,\" said Tremaine. \"Bicycles are out.\"\n\n\n Grammond snorted. \"Okay, Tremaine,\" he said. \"You're the boy with all  the answers. But if you get in trouble, don't call me; call Washington.\" Back in his room, Tremaine put through a call.\n\n\n \"It looks like Grammond's not willing to be left out in the cold, Fred.  Tell him if he queers this\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I don't know but what he might have something,\" the voice came back  over the filtered hum. \"Suppose he smokes them out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't go dumb on me, Fred. We're not dealing with West Virginia  moonshiners.\"\n\n\n \"Don't tell me my job, Tremaine!\" the voice snapped. \"And don't try out  your famous temper on me. I'm still in charge of this investigation.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. Just don't get stuck in some senator's hip pocket.\" Tremaine  hung up the telephone, went to the dresser and poured two fingers of  Scotch into a water glass. He tossed it down, then pulled on his coat  and left the hotel.\n\n\n He walked south two blocks, turned left down a twilit side street. He  walked slowly, looking at the weathered frame houses. Number 89 was a  once-stately three-storied mansion overgrown with untrimmed vines, its  windows squares of sad yellow light. He pushed through the gate in the  ancient picket fence, mounted the porch steps and pushed the button  beside the door, a dark panel of cracked varnish. It was a long minute  before the door opened. A tall woman with white hair and a fine-boned  face looked at him coolly.\n\n\n \"Miss Carroll,\" Tremaine said. \"You won't remember me, but I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"There is nothing whatever wrong with my faculties, James,\" Miss  Carroll said calmly. Her voice was still resonant, a deep contralto.  Only a faint quaver reflected her age\u2014close to eighty, Tremaine  thought, startled.\n\n\n \"I'm flattered you remember me, Miss Carroll,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Come in.\" She led the way to a pleasant parlor set out with the  furnishings of another era. She motioned Tremaine to a seat and took a  straight chair across the room from him.\n\n\n \"You look very well, James,\" she said, nodding. \"I'm pleased to see  that you've amounted to something.\"\n\n\n \"Just another bureaucrat, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\n \"You were wise to leave Elsby. There is no future here for a young man.\"\n\n\n \"I often wondered why you didn't leave, Miss Carroll. I thought, even  as a boy, that you were a woman of great ability.\"\n\n\n \"Why did you come today, James?\" asked Miss Carroll.\n\n\n \"I....\" Tremaine started. He looked at the old lady. \"I want some  information. This is an important matter. May I rely on your  discretion?\"\n\n\n \"Of course.\"\n\n\n \"How long has Mr. Bram lived in Elsby?\" Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be  used against him?\"\n\n\n \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs  to be in the national interest.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,  James. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n\n\n \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the  year.\"\n\n\n \"What does he do for a living?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea.\"\n\n\n \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated  piece of country? What's his story?\"\n\n\n \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n\n\n \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his  last?\"\n\n\n \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n\n\n \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n\n\n A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away  impatiently.\n\n\n \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n\n\n Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill  you. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have  complete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will  be helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"  She paused. Tremaine waited.\n\n\n \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with  him to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.  He said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in  a cave beneath his house.\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity  and horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll  twisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When  we reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw  open a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me  there alone.\n\n\n \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried  to speak to me but I would not listen.\n\n\n \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to  keep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers  in a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would  consent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.  He never called again.\"\n\n\n \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a  silver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I  am, James.\"\n\n\n \"May I see it?\"\n\n\n She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to  examine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll nodded.\n\n\n \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n\n\n \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n\n\n \"Bram fears the thunder.\" III\n\n\n As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car  pulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and  asked:\n\n\n \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n\n\n Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a  dud, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\n \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting  a little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n\n\n \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n\n\n As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about  State Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand  from what you were saying to me.\"\n\n\n \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of  me. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm  wondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring  working\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this  and neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...  and maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough  mistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n\n\n The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as  Jess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees  before the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got  out, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the  door. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and  the paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up  a strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an  empty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he  said. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n\n\n He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to  Tremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a  gun?\"\n\n\n \"In the car.\"\n\n\n \"Better get it.\"\n\n\n Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,  rejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen  Jess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate  lay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n\n\n \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n\n\n \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the  distance.\n\n\n \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n\n\n A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"  Tremaine said.\n\n\n Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of  light showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n\n\n \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad  slabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n\n\n \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n\n\n \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.  It ended suddenly near the wall.\n\n\n \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n\n\n A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess  stared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"  he said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing  tricks?\"\n\n\n \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few  questions.\" At the station Jess led Tremaine to a cell where a lanky teen-age boy  lounged on a steel-framed cot, blinking up at the visitor under a mop  of greased hair.\n\n\n \"Hull, this is Mr. Tremaine,\" said Jess. He took out a heavy key, swung  the cell door open. \"He wants to talk to you.\"\n\n\n \"I ain't done nothin,\" Hull said sullenly. \"There ain't nothin wrong  with burnin out a Commie, is there?\"\n\n\n \"Bram's a Commie, is he?\" Tremaine said softly. \"How'd you find that  out, Hull?\"\n\n\n \"He's a foreigner, ain't he?\" the youth shot back. \"Besides, we  heard....\"\n\n\n \"What did you hear?\"\n\n\n \"They're lookin for the spies.\"\n\n\n \"Who's looking for spies?\"\n\n\n \"Cops.\"\n\n\n \"Who says so?\"\n\n\n The boy looked directly at Tremaine for an instant, flicked his eyes to  the corner of the cell. \"Cops was talkin about 'em,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Spill it, Hull,\" the policeman said. \"Mr. Tremaine hasn't got all  night.\"\n\n\n \"They parked out east of town, on 302, back of the woodlot. They called  me over and asked me a bunch of questions. Said I could help 'em get  them spies. Wanted to know all about any funny-actin people around  hers.\"\n\n\n \"And you mentioned Bram?\"\n\n\n The boy darted another look at Tremaine. \"They said they figured the  spies was out north of town. Well, Bram's a foreigner, and he's out  that way, ain't he?\"\n\n\n \"Anything else?\"\n\n\n The boy looked at his feet. ",

I\n\n\n In his room at the Elsby Commercial Hotel, Tremaine opened his luggage  and took out a small tool kit, used a screwdriver to remove the bottom  cover plate from the telephone. He inserted a tiny aluminum cylinder,  crimped wires and replaced the cover. Then he dialed a long-distance  Washington number and waited half a minute for the connection.\n\n\n \"Fred, Tremaine here. Put the buzzer on.\" A thin hum sounded on the  wire as the scrambler went into operation.\n\n\n \"Okay, can you read me all right? I'm set up in Elsby. Grammond's boys  are supposed to keep me informed. Meantime, I'm not sitting in this  damned room crouched over a dial. I'll be out and around for the rest  of the afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"I want to see results,\" the thin voice came back over the filtered  hum of the jamming device. \"You spent a week with Grammond\u2014I can't  wait another. I don't mind telling you certain quarters are pressing  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fred, when will you learn to sit on your news breaks until you've got  some answers to go with the questions?\"\n\n\n \"I'm an appointive official,\" Fred said sharply. \"But never mind  that. This fellow Margrave\u2014General Margrave. Project Officer for the  hyperwave program\u2014he's been on my neck day and night. I can't say I  blame him. An unauthorized transmitter interfering with a Top Secret  project, progress slowing to a halt, and this Bureau\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Fred. I was happy in the lab. Headaches, nightmares and all.  Hyperwave is my baby, remember? You elected me to be a leg-man: now let  me do it my way.\"\n\n\n \"I felt a technical man might succeed where a trained investigator  could be misled. And since it seems to be pinpointed in your home  area\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You don't have to justify yourself. Just don't hold out on me. I  sometimes wonder if I've seen the complete files on this\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've seen all the files! Now I want answers, not questions! I'm  warning you, Tremaine. Get that transmitter. I need someone to hang!\" Tremaine left the hotel, walked two blocks west along Commerce Street  and turned in at a yellow brick building with the words ELSBY  MUNICIPAL POLICE cut in the stone lintel above the door. Inside, a  heavy man with a creased face and thick gray hair looked up from behind  an ancient Underwood. He studied Tremaine, shifted a toothpick to the  opposite corner of his mouth.\n\n\n \"Don't I know you, mister?\" he said. His soft voice carried a note of  authority.\n\n\n Tremaine took off his hat. \"Sure you do, Jess. It's been a while,  though.\"\n\n\n The policeman got to his feet. \"Jimmy,\" he said, \"Jimmy Tremaine.\" He  came to the counter and put out his hand. \"How are you, Jimmy? What  brings you back to the boondocks?\"\n\n\n \"Let's go somewhere and sit down, Jess.\"\n\n\n In a back room Tremaine said, \"To everybody but you this is just a  visit to the old home town. Between us, there's more.\"\n\n\n Jess nodded. \"I heard you were with the guv'ment.\"\n\n\n \"It won't take long to tell; we don't know much yet.\" Tremaine covered  the discovery of the powerful unidentified interference on the  high-security hyperwave band, the discovery that each transmission  produced not one but a pattern of \"fixes\" on the point of origin. He  passed a sheet of paper across the table. It showed a set of concentric  circles, overlapped by a similar group of rings.\n\n\n \"I think what we're getting is an echo effect from each of these  points of intersection. The rings themselves represent the diffraction  pattern\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold it, Jimmy. To me it just looks like a beer ad. I'll take your  word for it.\"\n\n\n \"The point is this, Jess: we think we've got it narrowed down to this  section. I'm not sure of a damn thing, but I think that transmitter's  near here. Now, have you got any ideas?\"\n\n\n \"That's a tough one, Jimmy. This is where I should come up with the  news that Old Man Whatchamacallit's got an attic full of gear he says  is a time machine. Trouble is, folks around here haven't even taken  to TV. They figure we should be content with radio, like the Lord  intended.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't expect any easy answers, Jess. But I was hoping maybe you had  something ...\"\n\n\n \"Course,\" said Jess, \"there's always Mr. Bram ...\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Bram,\" repeated Tremaine. \"Is he still around? I remember him as a  hundred years old when I was kid.\"\n\n\n \"Still just the same, Jimmy. Comes in town maybe once a week, buys his  groceries and hikes back out to his place by the river.\"\n\n\n \"Well, what about him?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing. But he's the town's mystery man. You know that. A little  touched in the head.\"\n\n\n \"There were a lot of funny stories about him, I remember,\" Tremaine  said. \"I always liked him. One time he tried to teach me something  I've forgotten. Wanted me to come out to his place and he'd teach me.  I never did go. We kids used to play in the caves near his place, and  sometimes he gave us apples.\" \"I've never seen any harm in Bram,\" said Jess. \"But you know how this  town is about foreigners, especially when they're a mite addled. Bram  has blue eyes and blond hair\u2014or did before it turned white\u2014and he  talks just like everybody else. From a distance he seems just like an  ordinary American. But up close, you feel it. He's foreign, all right.  But we never did know where he came from.\"\n\n\n \"How long's he lived here in Elsby?\"\n\n\n \"Beats me, Jimmy. You remember old Aunt Tress, used to know all about  ancestors and such as that? She couldn't remember about Mr. Bram. She  was kind of senile, I guess. She used to say he'd lived in that same  old place out on the Concord road when she was a girl. Well, she died  five years ago ... in her seventies. He still walks in town every  Wednesday ... or he did up till yesterday anyway.\"\n\n\n \"Oh?\" Tremaine stubbed out his cigarette, lit another. \"What happened  then?\"\n\n\n \"You remember Soup Gaskin? He's got a boy, name of Hull. He's Soup all  over again.\"\n\n\n \"I remember Soup,\" Tremaine said. \"He and his bunch used to come in  the drug store where I worked and perch on the stools and kid around  with me, and Mr. Hempleman would watch them from over back of the  prescription counter and look nervous. They used to raise cain in the  other drug store....\"\n\n\n \"Soup's been in the pen since then. His boy Hull's the same kind. Him  and a bunch of his pals went out to Bram's place one night and set it  on fire.\"\n\n\n \"What was the idea of that?\"\n\n\n \"Dunno. Just meanness, I reckon. Not much damage done. A car was  passing by and called it in. I had the whole caboodle locked up here  for six hours. Then the sob sisters went to work: poor little tyke  routine, high spirits, you know the line. All of 'em but Hull are back  in the streets playin' with matches by now. I'm waiting for the day  they'll make jail age.\"\n\n\n \"Why Bram?\" Tremaine persisted. \"As far as I know, he never had any  dealings to speak of with anybody here in town.\"\n\n\n \"Oh hoh, you're a little young, Jimmy,\" Jess chuckled. \"You never knew  about Mr. Bram\u2014the young Mr. Bram\u2014and Linda Carroll.\"\n\n\n Tremaine shook his head.\n\n\n \"Old Miss Carroll. School teacher here for years; guess she was retired  by the time you were playing hookey. But her dad had money, and in  her day she was a beauty. Too good for the fellers in these parts. I  remember her ridin by in a high-wheeled shay, when I was just a nipper.  Sitting up proud and tall, with that red hair piled up high. I used to  think she was some kind of princess....\"\n\n\n \"What about her and Bram? A romance?\" Jess rocked his chair back on two legs, looked at the ceiling,  frowning. \"This would ha' been about nineteen-oh-one. I was no more'n  eight years old. Miss Linda was maybe in her twenties\u2014and that made  her an old maid, in those times. The word got out she was setting  her cap for Bram. He was a good-looking young feller then, over six  foot, of course, broad backed, curly yellow hair\u2014and a stranger to  boot. Like I said, Linda Carroll wanted nothin to do with the local  bucks. There was a big shindy planned. Now, you know Bram was funny  about any kind of socializing; never would go any place at night. But  this was a Sunday afternoon and someways or other they got Bram down  there; and Miss Linda made her play, right there in front of the town,  practically. Just before sundown they went off together in that fancy  shay. And the next day, she was home again\u2014alone. That finished off  her reputation, as far as the biddies in Elsby was concerned. It was  ten years 'fore she even landed the teaching job. By that time, she was  already old. And nobody was ever fool enough to mention the name Bram  in front of her.\"\n\n\n Tremaine got to his feet. \"I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your ears  and eyes open for anything that might build into a lead on this, Jess.  Meantime, I'm just a tourist, seeing the sights.\"\n\n\n \"What about that gear of yours? Didn't you say you had some kind of  detector you were going to set up?\"\n\n\n \"I've got an oversized suitcase,\" Tremaine said. \"I'll be setting it up  in my room over at the hotel.\"\n\n\n \"When's this bootleg station supposed to broadcast again?\"\n\n\n \"After dark. I'm working on a few ideas. It might be an infinitely  repeating logarithmic sequence, based on\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold it, Jimmy. You're over my head.\" Jess got to his feet. \"Let me  know if you want anything. And by the way\u2014\" he winked broadly\u2014\"I  always did know who busted Soup Gaskin's nose and took out his front  teeth.\" II\n\n\n Back in the street, Tremaine headed south toward the Elsby Town  Hall, a squat structure of brownish-red brick, crouched under yellow  autumn trees at the end of Sheridan Street. Tremaine went up the  steps and past heavy double doors. Ten yards along the dim corridor,  a hand-lettered cardboard sign over a black-varnished door said  \"MUNICIPAL OFFICE OF RECORD.\" Tremaine opened the door and went in.\n\n\n A thin man with garters above the elbow looked over his shoulder at  Tremaine.\n\n\n \"We're closed,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I won't be a minute,\" Tremaine said. \"Just want to check on when the  Bram property changed hands last.\"\n\n\n The man turned to Tremaine, pushing a drawer shut with his hip. \"Bram?  He dead?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing like that. I just want to know when he bought the place.\"\n\n\n The man came over to the counter, eyeing Tremaine. \"He ain't going to  sell, mister, if that's what you want to know.\"\n\n\n \"I want to know when he bought.\"\n\n\n The man hesitated, closed his jaw hard. \"Come back tomorrow,\" he said.\n\n\n Tremaine put a hand on the counter, looked thoughtful. \"I was hoping  to save a trip.\" He lifted his hand and scratched the side of his jaw.  A folded bill opened on the counter. The thin man's eyes darted toward  it. His hand eased out, covered the bill. He grinned quickly.\n\n\n \"See what I can do,\" he said.\n\n\n It was ten minutes before he beckoned Tremaine over to the table where  a two-foot-square book lay open. An untrimmed fingernail indicated a  line written in faded ink:\n\n\n \"May 19. Acreage sold, One Dollar and other G&amp;V consid. NW Quarter  Section 24, Township Elsby. Bram. (see Vol. 9 &amp; cet.)\"\n\n\n \"Translated, what does that mean?\" said Tremaine.\n\n\n \"That's the ledger for 1901; means Bram bought a quarter section on the  nineteenth of May. You want me to look up the deed?\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks,\" Tremaine said. \"That's all I needed.\" He turned back to  the door.\n\n\n \"What's up, mister?\" the clerk called after him. \"Bram in some kind of  trouble?\"\n\n\n \"No. No trouble.\"\n\n\n The man was looking at the book with pursed lips. \"Nineteen-oh-one,\"  he said. \"I never thought of it before, but you know, old Bram must be  dern near to ninety years old. Spry for that age.\"\n\n\n \"I guess you're right.\"\n\n\n The clerk looked sideways at Tremaine. \"Lots of funny stories about  old Bram. Useta say his place was haunted. You know; funny noises and  lights. And they used to say there was money buried out at his place.\"\n\n\n \"I've heard those stories. Just superstition, wouldn't you say?\"\n\n\n \"Maybe so.\" The clerk leaned on the counter, assumed a knowing look.  \"There's one story that's not superstition....\"\n\n\n Tremaine waited.\n\n\n \"You\u2014uh\u2014paying anything for information?\"\n\n\n \"Now why would I do that?\" Tremaine reached for the door knob.\n\n\n The clerk shrugged. \"Thought I'd ask. Anyway\u2014I can swear to this.  Nobody in this town's ever seen Bram between sundown and sunup.\" Untrimmed sumacs threw late-afternoon shadows on the discolored stucco  facade of the Elsby Public Library. Inside, Tremaine followed a  paper-dry woman of indeterminate age to a rack of yellowed newsprint.\n\n\n \"You'll find back to nineteen-forty here,\" the librarian said. \"The  older are there in the shelves.\"\n\n\n \"I want nineteen-oh-one, if they go back that far.\"\n\n\n The woman darted a suspicious look at Tremaine. \"You have to handle  these old papers carefully.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be extremely careful.\" The woman sniffed, opened a drawer, leafed  through it, muttering.\n\n\n \"What date was it you wanted?\"\n\n\n \"Nineteen-oh-one; the week of May nineteenth.\"\n\n\n The librarian pulled out a folded paper, placed it on the table,  adjusted her glasses, squinted at the front page. \"That's it,\" she  said. \"These papers keep pretty well, provided they're stored in the  dark. But they're still flimsy, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'll remember.\" The woman stood by as Tremaine looked over the front  page. The lead article concerned the opening of the Pan-American  Exposition at Buffalo. Vice-President Roosevelt had made a speech.  Tremaine leafed over, reading slowly.\n\n\n On page four, under a column headed County Notes he saw the name Bram:\n\n\n Mr. Bram has purchased a quarter section of fine grazing land,  north of town, together with a sturdy house, from J. P. Spivey of  Elsby. Mr. Bram will occupy the home and will continue to graze a  few head of stock. Mr. Bram, who is a newcomer to the county, has  been a resident of Mrs. Stoate's Guest Home in Elsby for the past  months.\n\n\n \"May I see some earlier issues; from about the first of the year?\"\n\n\n The librarian produced the papers. Tremaine turned the pages, read the  heads, skimmed an article here and there. The librarian went back to  her desk. An hour later, in the issue for July 7, 1900, an item caught  his eye:\n\n\n A Severe Thunderstorm. Citizens of Elsby and the country were much  alarmed by a violent cloudburst, accompanied by lightning and  thunder, during the night of the fifth. A fire set in the pine  woods north of Spivey's farm destroyed a considerable amount of  timber and threatened the house before burning itself out along  the river.\n\n\n The librarian was at Tremaine's side. \"I have to close the library now.  You'll have to come back tomorrow.\"\n\n\n Outside, the sky was sallow in the west: lights were coming on in  windows along the side streets. Tremaine turned up his collar against a  cold wind that had risen, started along the street toward the hotel.\n\n\n A block away a black late-model sedan rounded a corner with a faint  squeal of tires and gunned past him, a heavy antenna mounted forward  of the left rear tail fin whipping in the slipstream. Tremaine stopped  short, stared after the car.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" he said aloud. An elderly man veered, eyeing him sharply.  Tremaine set off at a run, covered the two blocks to the hotel, yanked  open the door to his car, slid into the seat, made a U-turn, and headed  north after the police car. Two miles into the dark hills north of the Elsby city limits, Tremaine  rounded a curve. The police car was parked on the shoulder beside the  highway just ahead. He pulled off the road ahead of it and walked back.  The door opened. A tall figure stepped out.\n\n\n \"What's your problem, mister?\" a harsh voice drawled.\n\n\n \"What's the matter? Run out of signal?\"\n\n\n \"What's it to you, mister?\"\n\n\n \"Are you boys in touch with Grammond on the car set?\"\n\n\n \"We could be.\"\n\n\n \"Mind if I have a word with him? My name's Tremaine.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the cop, \"you're the big shot from Washington.\" He shifted  chewing tobacco to the other side of his jaw. \"Sure, you can talk to  him.\" He turned and spoke to the other cop, who muttered into the mike  before handing it to Tremaine.\n\n\n The heavy voice of the State Police chief crackled. \"What's your beef,  Tremaine?\"\n\n\n \"I thought you were going to keep your men away from Elsby until I gave  the word, Grammond.\"\n\n\n \"That was before I knew your Washington stuffed shirts were holding out  on me.\"\n\n\n \"It's nothing we can go to court with, Grammond. And the job you were  doing might have been influenced if I'd told you about the Elsby angle.\"\n\n\n Grammond cursed. \"I could have put my men in the town and taken it  apart brick by brick in the time\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's just what I don't want. If our bird sees cops cruising, he'll  go underground.\"\n\n\n \"You've got it all figured, I see. I'm just the dumb hick you boys use  for the spade work, that it?\"\n\n\n \"Pull your lip back in. You've given me the confirmation I needed.\"\n\n\n \"Confirmation, hell! All I know is that somebody somewhere is punching  out a signal. For all I know, it's forty midgets on bicycles, pedalling  all over the damned state. I've got fixes in every county\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The smallest hyperwave transmitter Uncle Sam knows how to build weighs  three tons,\" said Tremaine. \"Bicycles are out.\"\n\n\n Grammond snorted. \"Okay, Tremaine,\" he said. \"You're the boy with all  the answers. But if you get in trouble, don't call me; call Washington.\" Back in his room, Tremaine put through a call.\n\n\n \"It looks like Grammond's not willing to be left out in the cold, Fred.  Tell him if he queers this\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I don't know but what he might have something,\" the voice came back  over the filtered hum. \"Suppose he smokes them out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't go dumb on me, Fred. We're not dealing with West Virginia  moonshiners.\"\n\n\n \"Don't tell me my job, Tremaine!\" the voice snapped. \"And don't try out  your famous temper on me. I'm still in charge of this investigation.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. Just don't get stuck in some senator's hip pocket.\" Tremaine  hung up the telephone, went to the dresser and poured two fingers of  Scotch into a water glass. He tossed it down, then pulled on his coat  and left the hotel.\n\n\n He walked south two blocks, turned left down a twilit side street. He  walked slowly, looking at the weathered frame houses. Number 89 was a  once-stately three-storied mansion overgrown with untrimmed vines, its  windows squares of sad yellow light. He pushed through the gate in the  ancient picket fence, mounted the porch steps and pushed the button  beside the door, a dark panel of cracked varnish. It was a long minute  before the door opened. A tall woman with white hair and a fine-boned  face looked at him coolly.\n\n\n \"Miss Carroll,\" Tremaine said. \"You won't remember me, but I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"There is nothing whatever wrong with my faculties, James,\" Miss  Carroll said calmly. Her voice was still resonant, a deep contralto.  Only a faint quaver reflected her age\u2014close to eighty, Tremaine  thought, startled.\n\n\n \"I'm flattered you remember me, Miss Carroll,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Come in.\" She led the way to a pleasant parlor set out with the  furnishings of another era. She motioned Tremaine to a seat and took a  straight chair across the room from him.\n\n\n \"You look very well, James,\" she said, nodding. \"I'm pleased to see  that you've amounted to something.\"\n\n\n \"Just another bureaucrat, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\n \"You were wise to leave Elsby. There is no future here for a young man.\"\n\n\n \"I often wondered why you didn't leave, Miss Carroll. I thought, even  as a boy, that you were a woman of great ability.\"\n\n\n \"Why did you come today, James?\" asked Miss Carroll.\n\n\n \"I....\" Tremaine started. He looked at the old lady. \"I want some  information. This is an important matter. May I rely on your  discretion?\"\n\n\n \"Of course.\"\n\n\n \"How long has Mr. Bram lived in Elsby?\" Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be  used against him?\"\n\n\n \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs  to be in the national interest.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,  James. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n\n\n \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the  year.\"\n\n\n \"What does he do for a living?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea.\"\n\n\n \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated  piece of country? What's his story?\"\n\n\n \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n\n\n \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his  last?\"\n\n\n \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n\n\n \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n\n\n A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away  impatiently.\n\n\n \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n\n\n Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill  you. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have  complete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will  be helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"  She paused. Tremaine waited.\n\n\n \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with  him to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.  He said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in  a cave beneath his house.\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity  and horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll  twisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When  we reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw  open a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me  there alone.\n\n\n \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried  to speak to me but I would not listen.\n\n\n \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to  keep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers  in a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would  consent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.  He never called again.\"\n\n\n \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a  silver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I  am, James.\"\n\n\n \"May I see it?\"\n\n\n She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to  examine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll nodded.\n\n\n \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n\n\n \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n\n\n \"Bram fears the thunder.\" III\n\n\n As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car  pulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and  asked:\n\n\n \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n\n\n Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a  dud, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\n \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting  a little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n\n\n \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n\n\n As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about  State Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand  from what you were saying to me.\"\n\n\n \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of  me. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm  wondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring  working\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this  and neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...  and maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough  mistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n\n\n The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as  Jess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees  before the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got  out, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the  door. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and  the paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up  a strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an  empty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he  said. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n\n\n He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to  Tremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a  gun?\"\n\n\n \"In the car.\"\n\n\n \"Better get it.\"\n\n\n Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,  rejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen  Jess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate  lay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n\n\n \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n\n\n \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the  distance.\n\n\n \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n\n\n A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"  Tremaine said.\n\n\n Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of  light showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n\n\n \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad  slabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n\n\n \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n\n\n \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.  It ended suddenly near the wall.\n\n\n \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n\n\n A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess  stared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"  he said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing  tricks?\"\n\n\n \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few  questions.\" At the station Jess led Tremaine to a cell where a lanky teen-age boy  lounged on a steel-framed cot, blinking up at the visitor under a mop  of greased hair.\n\n\n \"Hull, this is Mr. Tremaine,\" said Jess. He took out a heavy key, swung  the cell door open. \"He wants to talk to you.\"\n\n\n \"I ain't done nothin,\" Hull said sullenly. \"There ain't nothin wrong  with burnin out a Commie, is there?\"\n\n\n \"Bram's a Commie, is he?\" Tremaine said softly. \"How'd you find that  out, Hull?\"\n\n\n \"He's a foreigner, ain't he?\" the youth shot back. \"Besides, we  heard....\"\n\n\n \"What did you hear?\"\n\n\n \"They're lookin for the spies.\"\n\n\n \"Who's looking for spies?\"\n\n\n \"Cops.\"\n\n\n \"Who says so?\"\n\n\n The boy looked directly at Tremaine for an instant, flicked his eyes to  the corner of the cell. \"Cops was talkin about 'em,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Spill it, Hull,\" the policeman said. \"Mr. Tremaine hasn't got all  night.\"\n\n\n \"They parked out east of town, on 302, back of the woodlot. They called  me over and asked me a bunch of questions. Said I could help 'em get  them spies. Wanted to know all about any funny-actin people around  hers.\"\n\n\n \"And you mentioned Bram?\"\n\n\n The boy darted another look at Tremaine. \"They said they figured the  spies was out north of town. Well, Bram's a foreigner, and he's out  that way, ain't he?\"\n\n\n \"Anything else?\"\n\n\n The boy looked at his feet. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich best summarizes this story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"A private investigator tries to find a transmitter which allows him to save his hometown from certain danger.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"An investigator travels to his hometown to locate a transmitter with an unknown use.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"An investigator travels to his hometown to locate a transmitter with an unknown use.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"An investigator travels to his hometown to locate a transmitter with an unknown use.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

I\n\n\n In his room at the Elsby Commercial Hotel, Tremaine opened his luggage  and took out a small tool kit, used a screwdriver to remove the bottom  cover plate from the telephone. He inserted a tiny aluminum cylinder,  crimped wires and replaced the cover. Then he dialed a long-distance  Washington number and waited half a minute for the connection.\n\n\n \"Fred, Tremaine here. Put the buzzer on.\" A thin hum sounded on the  wire as the scrambler went into operation.\n\n\n \"Okay, can you read me all right? I'm set up in Elsby. Grammond's boys  are supposed to keep me informed. Meantime, I'm not sitting in this  damned room crouched over a dial. I'll be out and around for the rest  of the afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"I want to see results,\" the thin voice came back over the filtered  hum of the jamming device. \"You spent a week with Grammond\u2014I can't  wait another. I don't mind telling you certain quarters are pressing  me.\"\n\n\n \"Fred, when will you learn to sit on your news breaks until you've got  some answers to go with the questions?\"\n\n\n \"I'm an appointive official,\" Fred said sharply. \"But never mind  that. This fellow Margrave\u2014General Margrave. Project Officer for the  hyperwave program\u2014he's been on my neck day and night. I can't say I  blame him. An unauthorized transmitter interfering with a Top Secret  project, progress slowing to a halt, and this Bureau\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Fred. I was happy in the lab. Headaches, nightmares and all.  Hyperwave is my baby, remember? You elected me to be a leg-man: now let  me do it my way.\"\n\n\n \"I felt a technical man might succeed where a trained investigator  could be misled. And since it seems to be pinpointed in your home  area\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You don't have to justify yourself. Just don't hold out on me. I  sometimes wonder if I've seen the complete files on this\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've seen all the files! Now I want answers, not questions! I'm  warning you, Tremaine. Get that transmitter. I need someone to hang!\" Tremaine left the hotel, walked two blocks west along Commerce Street  and turned in at a yellow brick building with the words ELSBY  MUNICIPAL POLICE cut in the stone lintel above the door. Inside, a  heavy man with a creased face and thick gray hair looked up from behind  an ancient Underwood. He studied Tremaine, shifted a toothpick to the  opposite corner of his mouth.\n\n\n \"Don't I know you, mister?\" he said. His soft voice carried a note of  authority.\n\n\n Tremaine took off his hat. \"Sure you do, Jess. It's been a while,  though.\"\n\n\n The policeman got to his feet. \"Jimmy,\" he said, \"Jimmy Tremaine.\" He  came to the counter and put out his hand. \"How are you, Jimmy? What  brings you back to the boondocks?\"\n\n\n \"Let's go somewhere and sit down, Jess.\"\n\n\n In a back room Tremaine said, \"To everybody but you this is just a  visit to the old home town. Between us, there's more.\"\n\n\n Jess nodded. \"I heard you were with the guv'ment.\"\n\n\n \"It won't take long to tell; we don't know much yet.\" Tremaine covered  the discovery of the powerful unidentified interference on the  high-security hyperwave band, the discovery that each transmission  produced not one but a pattern of \"fixes\" on the point of origin. He  passed a sheet of paper across the table. It showed a set of concentric  circles, overlapped by a similar group of rings.\n\n\n \"I think what we're getting is an echo effect from each of these  points of intersection. The rings themselves represent the diffraction  pattern\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold it, Jimmy. To me it just looks like a beer ad. I'll take your  word for it.\"\n\n\n \"The point is this, Jess: we think we've got it narrowed down to this  section. I'm not sure of a damn thing, but I think that transmitter's  near here. Now, have you got any ideas?\"\n\n\n \"That's a tough one, Jimmy. This is where I should come up with the  news that Old Man Whatchamacallit's got an attic full of gear he says  is a time machine. Trouble is, folks around here haven't even taken  to TV. They figure we should be content with radio, like the Lord  intended.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't expect any easy answers, Jess. But I was hoping maybe you had  something ...\"\n\n\n \"Course,\" said Jess, \"there's always Mr. Bram ...\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Bram,\" repeated Tremaine. \"Is he still around? I remember him as a  hundred years old when I was kid.\"\n\n\n \"Still just the same, Jimmy. Comes in town maybe once a week, buys his  groceries and hikes back out to his place by the river.\"\n\n\n \"Well, what about him?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing. But he's the town's mystery man. You know that. A little  touched in the head.\"\n\n\n \"There were a lot of funny stories about him, I remember,\" Tremaine  said. \"I always liked him. One time he tried to teach me something  I've forgotten. Wanted me to come out to his place and he'd teach me.  I never did go. We kids used to play in the caves near his place, and  sometimes he gave us apples.\" \"I've never seen any harm in Bram,\" said Jess. \"But you know how this  town is about foreigners, especially when they're a mite addled. Bram  has blue eyes and blond hair\u2014or did before it turned white\u2014and he  talks just like everybody else. From a distance he seems just like an  ordinary American. But up close, you feel it. He's foreign, all right.  But we never did know where he came from.\"\n\n\n \"How long's he lived here in Elsby?\"\n\n\n \"Beats me, Jimmy. You remember old Aunt Tress, used to know all about  ancestors and such as that? She couldn't remember about Mr. Bram. She  was kind of senile, I guess. She used to say he'd lived in that same  old place out on the Concord road when she was a girl. Well, she died  five years ago ... in her seventies. He still walks in town every  Wednesday ... or he did up till yesterday anyway.\"\n\n\n \"Oh?\" Tremaine stubbed out his cigarette, lit another. \"What happened  then?\"\n\n\n \"You remember Soup Gaskin? He's got a boy, name of Hull. He's Soup all  over again.\"\n\n\n \"I remember Soup,\" Tremaine said. \"He and his bunch used to come in  the drug store where I worked and perch on the stools and kid around  with me, and Mr. Hempleman would watch them from over back of the  prescription counter and look nervous. They used to raise cain in the  other drug store....\"\n\n\n \"Soup's been in the pen since then. His boy Hull's the same kind. Him  and a bunch of his pals went out to Bram's place one night and set it  on fire.\"\n\n\n \"What was the idea of that?\"\n\n\n \"Dunno. Just meanness, I reckon. Not much damage done. A car was  passing by and called it in. I had the whole caboodle locked up here  for six hours. Then the sob sisters went to work: poor little tyke  routine, high spirits, you know the line. All of 'em but Hull are back  in the streets playin' with matches by now. I'm waiting for the day  they'll make jail age.\"\n\n\n \"Why Bram?\" Tremaine persisted. \"As far as I know, he never had any  dealings to speak of with anybody here in town.\"\n\n\n \"Oh hoh, you're a little young, Jimmy,\" Jess chuckled. \"You never knew  about Mr. Bram\u2014the young Mr. Bram\u2014and Linda Carroll.\"\n\n\n Tremaine shook his head.\n\n\n \"Old Miss Carroll. School teacher here for years; guess she was retired  by the time you were playing hookey. But her dad had money, and in  her day she was a beauty. Too good for the fellers in these parts. I  remember her ridin by in a high-wheeled shay, when I was just a nipper.  Sitting up proud and tall, with that red hair piled up high. I used to  think she was some kind of princess....\"\n\n\n \"What about her and Bram? A romance?\" Jess rocked his chair back on two legs, looked at the ceiling,  frowning. \"This would ha' been about nineteen-oh-one. I was no more'n  eight years old. Miss Linda was maybe in her twenties\u2014and that made  her an old maid, in those times. The word got out she was setting  her cap for Bram. He was a good-looking young feller then, over six  foot, of course, broad backed, curly yellow hair\u2014and a stranger to  boot. Like I said, Linda Carroll wanted nothin to do with the local  bucks. There was a big shindy planned. Now, you know Bram was funny  about any kind of socializing; never would go any place at night. But  this was a Sunday afternoon and someways or other they got Bram down  there; and Miss Linda made her play, right there in front of the town,  practically. Just before sundown they went off together in that fancy  shay. And the next day, she was home again\u2014alone. That finished off  her reputation, as far as the biddies in Elsby was concerned. It was  ten years 'fore she even landed the teaching job. By that time, she was  already old. And nobody was ever fool enough to mention the name Bram  in front of her.\"\n\n\n Tremaine got to his feet. \"I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your ears  and eyes open for anything that might build into a lead on this, Jess.  Meantime, I'm just a tourist, seeing the sights.\"\n\n\n \"What about that gear of yours? Didn't you say you had some kind of  detector you were going to set up?\"\n\n\n \"I've got an oversized suitcase,\" Tremaine said. \"I'll be setting it up  in my room over at the hotel.\"\n\n\n \"When's this bootleg station supposed to broadcast again?\"\n\n\n \"After dark. I'm working on a few ideas. It might be an infinitely  repeating logarithmic sequence, based on\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold it, Jimmy. You're over my head.\" Jess got to his feet. \"Let me  know if you want anything. And by the way\u2014\" he winked broadly\u2014\"I  always did know who busted Soup Gaskin's nose and took out his front  teeth.\" II\n\n\n Back in the street, Tremaine headed south toward the Elsby Town  Hall, a squat structure of brownish-red brick, crouched under yellow  autumn trees at the end of Sheridan Street. Tremaine went up the  steps and past heavy double doors. Ten yards along the dim corridor,  a hand-lettered cardboard sign over a black-varnished door said  \"MUNICIPAL OFFICE OF RECORD.\" Tremaine opened the door and went in.\n\n\n A thin man with garters above the elbow looked over his shoulder at  Tremaine.\n\n\n \"We're closed,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I won't be a minute,\" Tremaine said. \"Just want to check on when the  Bram property changed hands last.\"\n\n\n The man turned to Tremaine, pushing a drawer shut with his hip. \"Bram?  He dead?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing like that. I just want to know when he bought the place.\"\n\n\n The man came over to the counter, eyeing Tremaine. \"He ain't going to  sell, mister, if that's what you want to know.\"\n\n\n \"I want to know when he bought.\"\n\n\n The man hesitated, closed his jaw hard. \"Come back tomorrow,\" he said.\n\n\n Tremaine put a hand on the counter, looked thoughtful. \"I was hoping  to save a trip.\" He lifted his hand and scratched the side of his jaw.  A folded bill opened on the counter. The thin man's eyes darted toward  it. His hand eased out, covered the bill. He grinned quickly.\n\n\n \"See what I can do,\" he said.\n\n\n It was ten minutes before he beckoned Tremaine over to the table where  a two-foot-square book lay open. An untrimmed fingernail indicated a  line written in faded ink:\n\n\n \"May 19. Acreage sold, One Dollar and other G&amp;V consid. NW Quarter  Section 24, Township Elsby. Bram. (see Vol. 9 &amp; cet.)\"\n\n\n \"Translated, what does that mean?\" said Tremaine.\n\n\n \"That's the ledger for 1901; means Bram bought a quarter section on the  nineteenth of May. You want me to look up the deed?\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks,\" Tremaine said. \"That's all I needed.\" He turned back to  the door.\n\n\n \"What's up, mister?\" the clerk called after him. \"Bram in some kind of  trouble?\"\n\n\n \"No. No trouble.\"\n\n\n The man was looking at the book with pursed lips. \"Nineteen-oh-one,\"  he said. \"I never thought of it before, but you know, old Bram must be  dern near to ninety years old. Spry for that age.\"\n\n\n \"I guess you're right.\"\n\n\n The clerk looked sideways at Tremaine. \"Lots of funny stories about  old Bram. Useta say his place was haunted. You know; funny noises and  lights. And they used to say there was money buried out at his place.\"\n\n\n \"I've heard those stories. Just superstition, wouldn't you say?\"\n\n\n \"Maybe so.\" The clerk leaned on the counter, assumed a knowing look.  \"There's one story that's not superstition....\"\n\n\n Tremaine waited.\n\n\n \"You\u2014uh\u2014paying anything for information?\"\n\n\n \"Now why would I do that?\" Tremaine reached for the door knob.\n\n\n The clerk shrugged. \"Thought I'd ask. Anyway\u2014I can swear to this.  Nobody in this town's ever seen Bram between sundown and sunup.\" Untrimmed sumacs threw late-afternoon shadows on the discolored stucco  facade of the Elsby Public Library. Inside, Tremaine followed a  paper-dry woman of indeterminate age to a rack of yellowed newsprint.\n\n\n \"You'll find back to nineteen-forty here,\" the librarian said. \"The  older are there in the shelves.\"\n\n\n \"I want nineteen-oh-one, if they go back that far.\"\n\n\n The woman darted a suspicious look at Tremaine. \"You have to handle  these old papers carefully.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be extremely careful.\" The woman sniffed, opened a drawer, leafed  through it, muttering.\n\n\n \"What date was it you wanted?\"\n\n\n \"Nineteen-oh-one; the week of May nineteenth.\"\n\n\n The librarian pulled out a folded paper, placed it on the table,  adjusted her glasses, squinted at the front page. \"That's it,\" she  said. \"These papers keep pretty well, provided they're stored in the  dark. But they're still flimsy, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'll remember.\" The woman stood by as Tremaine looked over the front  page. The lead article concerned the opening of the Pan-American  Exposition at Buffalo. Vice-President Roosevelt had made a speech.  Tremaine leafed over, reading slowly.\n\n\n On page four, under a column headed County Notes he saw the name Bram:\n\n\n Mr. Bram has purchased a quarter section of fine grazing land,  north of town, together with a sturdy house, from J. P. Spivey of  Elsby. Mr. Bram will occupy the home and will continue to graze a  few head of stock. Mr. Bram, who is a newcomer to the county, has  been a resident of Mrs. Stoate's Guest Home in Elsby for the past  months.\n\n\n \"May I see some earlier issues; from about the first of the year?\"\n\n\n The librarian produced the papers. Tremaine turned the pages, read the  heads, skimmed an article here and there. The librarian went back to  her desk. An hour later, in the issue for July 7, 1900, an item caught  his eye:\n\n\n A Severe Thunderstorm. Citizens of Elsby and the country were much  alarmed by a violent cloudburst, accompanied by lightning and  thunder, during the night of the fifth. A fire set in the pine  woods north of Spivey's farm destroyed a considerable amount of  timber and threatened the house before burning itself out along  the river.\n\n\n The librarian was at Tremaine's side. \"I have to close the library now.  You'll have to come back tomorrow.\"\n\n\n Outside, the sky was sallow in the west: lights were coming on in  windows along the side streets. Tremaine turned up his collar against a  cold wind that had risen, started along the street toward the hotel.\n\n\n A block away a black late-model sedan rounded a corner with a faint  squeal of tires and gunned past him, a heavy antenna mounted forward  of the left rear tail fin whipping in the slipstream. Tremaine stopped  short, stared after the car.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" he said aloud. An elderly man veered, eyeing him sharply.  Tremaine set off at a run, covered the two blocks to the hotel, yanked  open the door to his car, slid into the seat, made a U-turn, and headed  north after the police car. Two miles into the dark hills north of the Elsby city limits, Tremaine  rounded a curve. The police car was parked on the shoulder beside the  highway just ahead. He pulled off the road ahead of it and walked back.  The door opened. A tall figure stepped out.\n\n\n \"What's your problem, mister?\" a harsh voice drawled.\n\n\n \"What's the matter? Run out of signal?\"\n\n\n \"What's it to you, mister?\"\n\n\n \"Are you boys in touch with Grammond on the car set?\"\n\n\n \"We could be.\"\n\n\n \"Mind if I have a word with him? My name's Tremaine.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the cop, \"you're the big shot from Washington.\" He shifted  chewing tobacco to the other side of his jaw. \"Sure, you can talk to  him.\" He turned and spoke to the other cop, who muttered into the mike  before handing it to Tremaine.\n\n\n The heavy voice of the State Police chief crackled. \"What's your beef,  Tremaine?\"\n\n\n \"I thought you were going to keep your men away from Elsby until I gave  the word, Grammond.\"\n\n\n \"That was before I knew your Washington stuffed shirts were holding out  on me.\"\n\n\n \"It's nothing we can go to court with, Grammond. And the job you were  doing might have been influenced if I'd told you about the Elsby angle.\"\n\n\n Grammond cursed. \"I could have put my men in the town and taken it  apart brick by brick in the time\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's just what I don't want. If our bird sees cops cruising, he'll  go underground.\"\n\n\n \"You've got it all figured, I see. I'm just the dumb hick you boys use  for the spade work, that it?\"\n\n\n \"Pull your lip back in. You've given me the confirmation I needed.\"\n\n\n \"Confirmation, hell! All I know is that somebody somewhere is punching  out a signal. For all I know, it's forty midgets on bicycles, pedalling  all over the damned state. I've got fixes in every county\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The smallest hyperwave transmitter Uncle Sam knows how to build weighs  three tons,\" said Tremaine. \"Bicycles are out.\"\n\n\n Grammond snorted. \"Okay, Tremaine,\" he said. \"You're the boy with all  the answers. But if you get in trouble, don't call me; call Washington.\" Back in his room, Tremaine put through a call.\n\n\n \"It looks like Grammond's not willing to be left out in the cold, Fred.  Tell him if he queers this\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I don't know but what he might have something,\" the voice came back  over the filtered hum. \"Suppose he smokes them out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Don't go dumb on me, Fred. We're not dealing with West Virginia  moonshiners.\"\n\n\n \"Don't tell me my job, Tremaine!\" the voice snapped. \"And don't try out  your famous temper on me. I'm still in charge of this investigation.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. Just don't get stuck in some senator's hip pocket.\" Tremaine  hung up the telephone, went to the dresser and poured two fingers of  Scotch into a water glass. He tossed it down, then pulled on his coat  and left the hotel.\n\n\n He walked south two blocks, turned left down a twilit side street. He  walked slowly, looking at the weathered frame houses. Number 89 was a  once-stately three-storied mansion overgrown with untrimmed vines, its  windows squares of sad yellow light. He pushed through the gate in the  ancient picket fence, mounted the porch steps and pushed the button  beside the door, a dark panel of cracked varnish. It was a long minute  before the door opened. A tall woman with white hair and a fine-boned  face looked at him coolly.\n\n\n \"Miss Carroll,\" Tremaine said. \"You won't remember me, but I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"There is nothing whatever wrong with my faculties, James,\" Miss  Carroll said calmly. Her voice was still resonant, a deep contralto.  Only a faint quaver reflected her age\u2014close to eighty, Tremaine  thought, startled.\n\n\n \"I'm flattered you remember me, Miss Carroll,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Come in.\" She led the way to a pleasant parlor set out with the  furnishings of another era. She motioned Tremaine to a seat and took a  straight chair across the room from him.\n\n\n \"You look very well, James,\" she said, nodding. \"I'm pleased to see  that you've amounted to something.\"\n\n\n \"Just another bureaucrat, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\n \"You were wise to leave Elsby. There is no future here for a young man.\"\n\n\n \"I often wondered why you didn't leave, Miss Carroll. I thought, even  as a boy, that you were a woman of great ability.\"\n\n\n \"Why did you come today, James?\" asked Miss Carroll.\n\n\n \"I....\" Tremaine started. He looked at the old lady. \"I want some  information. This is an important matter. May I rely on your  discretion?\"\n\n\n \"Of course.\"\n\n\n \"How long has Mr. Bram lived in Elsby?\" Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be  used against him?\"\n\n\n \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs  to be in the national interest.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,  James. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n\n\n \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the  year.\"\n\n\n \"What does he do for a living?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea.\"\n\n\n \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated  piece of country? What's his story?\"\n\n\n \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n\n\n \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his  last?\"\n\n\n \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n\n\n \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n\n\n A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away  impatiently.\n\n\n \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n\n\n Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill  you. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have  complete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will  be helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"  She paused. Tremaine waited.\n\n\n \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with  him to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.  He said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in  a cave beneath his house.\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity  and horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll  twisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When  we reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw  open a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me  there alone.\n\n\n \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried  to speak to me but I would not listen.\n\n\n \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to  keep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers  in a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would  consent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.  He never called again.\"\n\n\n \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a  silver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I  am, James.\"\n\n\n \"May I see it?\"\n\n\n She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to  examine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n\n\n Miss Carroll nodded.\n\n\n \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n\n\n \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n\n\n \"Bram fears the thunder.\" III\n\n\n As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car  pulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and  asked:\n\n\n \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n\n\n Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a  dud, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\n \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting  a little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n\n\n \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n\n\n As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about  State Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand  from what you were saying to me.\"\n\n\n \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of  me. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm  wondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring  working\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this  and neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...  and maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough  mistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n\n\n The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as  Jess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees  before the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got  out, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the  door. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and  the paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up  a strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an  empty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he  said. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n\n\n He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to  Tremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a  gun?\"\n\n\n \"In the car.\"\n\n\n \"Better get it.\"\n\n\n Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,  rejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen  Jess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate  lay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n\n\n \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n\n\n \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the  distance.\n\n\n \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n\n\n A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"  Tremaine said.\n\n\n Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of  light showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n\n\n \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad  slabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n\n\n \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n\n\n \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.  It ended suddenly near the wall.\n\n\n \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n\n\n A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess  stared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"  he said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing  tricks?\"\n\n\n \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few  questions.\" At the station Jess led Tremaine to a cell where a lanky teen-age boy  lounged on a steel-framed cot, blinking up at the visitor under a mop  of greased hair.\n\n\n \"Hull, this is Mr. Tremaine,\" said Jess. He took out a heavy key, swung  the cell door open. \"He wants to talk to you.\"\n\n\n \"I ain't done nothin,\" Hull said sullenly. \"There ain't nothin wrong  with burnin out a Commie, is there?\"\n\n\n \"Bram's a Commie, is he?\" Tremaine said softly. \"How'd you find that  out, Hull?\"\n\n\n \"He's a foreigner, ain't he?\" the youth shot back. \"Besides, we  heard....\"\n\n\n \"What did you hear?\"\n\n\n \"They're lookin for the spies.\"\n\n\n \"Who's looking for spies?\"\n\n\n \"Cops.\"\n\n\n \"Who says so?\"\n\n\n The boy looked directly at Tremaine for an instant, flicked his eyes to  the corner of the cell. \"Cops was talkin about 'em,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Spill it, Hull,\" the policeman said. \"Mr. Tremaine hasn't got all  night.\"\n\n\n \"They parked out east of town, on 302, back of the woodlot. They called  me over and asked me a bunch of questions. Said I could help 'em get  them spies. Wanted to know all about any funny-actin people around  hers.\"\n\n\n \"And you mentioned Bram?\"\n\n\n The boy darted another look at Tremaine. \"They said they figured the  spies was out north of town. Well, Bram's a foreigner, and he's out  that way, ain't he?\"\n\n\n \"Anything else?\"\n\n\n The boy looked at his feet. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich best summarizes this story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"A private investigator tries to find a transmitter which allows him to save his hometown from certain danger.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"An investigator travels to his hometown to locate a transmitter with an unknown use.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"An investigator travels to his hometown to locate a transmitter with an unknown use.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"An investigator travels to his hometown to locate a transmitter with an unknown use.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
