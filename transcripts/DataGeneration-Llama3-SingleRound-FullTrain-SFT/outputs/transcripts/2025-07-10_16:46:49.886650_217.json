WALLACE\n\n\n Illustrated by EMSH\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction November 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Man's family tree was awesome enough to give every galactic   race an inferiority complex\u2014but then he tried to climb it! In repose, Taphetta the Ribboneer resembled a fancy giant bow on a  package. His four flat legs looped out and in, the ends tucked under  his wide, thin body, which constituted the knot at the middle. His neck  was flat, too, arching out in another loop. Of all his features, only  his head had appreciable thickness and it was crowned with a dozen long  though narrower ribbons.\n\n\n Taphetta rattled the head fronds together in a surprisingly good  imitation of speech. \"Yes, I've heard the legend.\"\n\n\n \"It's more than a legend,\" said Sam Halden, biologist. The reaction was  not unexpected\u2014non-humans tended to dismiss the data as convenient  speculation and nothing more. \"There are at least a hundred kinds of  humans, each supposedly originating in strict seclusion on as many  widely scattered planets. Obviously there was no contact throughout the  ages before space travel\u2014 and yet each planetary race can interbreed  with a minimum of ten others ! That's more than a legend\u2014one hell of a  lot more!\"\n\n\n \"It is impressive,\" admitted Taphetta. \"But I find it mildly  distasteful to consider mating with someone who does not belong to my  species.\"\n\n\n \"That's because you're unique,\" said Halden. \"Outside of your own  world, there's nothing like your species, except superficially, and  that's true of all other creatures, intelligent or not, with the sole  exception of mankind. Actually, the four of us here, though it's  accidental, very nearly represent the biological spectrum of human  development. \"Emmer, a Neanderthal type and our archeologist, is around the  beginning of the scale. I'm from Earth, near the middle, though on  Emmer's side. Meredith, linguist, is on the other side of the middle.  And beyond her, toward the far end, is Kelburn, mathematician. There's  a corresponding span of fertility. Emmer just misses being able to  breed with my kind, but there's a fair chance that I'd be fertile with  Meredith and a similar though lesser chance that her fertility may  extend to Kelburn.\" Taphetta rustled his speech ribbons quizzically. \"But I thought it was  proved that some humans did originate on one planet, that there was an  unbroken line of evolution that could be traced back a billion years.\"\n\n\n \"You're thinking of Earth,\" said Halden. \"Humans require a certain kind  of planet. It's reasonable to assume that, if men were set down on a  hundred such worlds, they'd seem to fit in with native life-forms on a  few of them. That's what happened on Earth; when Man arrived, there was  actually a manlike creature there. Naturally our early evolutionists  stretched their theories to cover the facts they had.\n\n\n \"But there are other worlds in which humans who were there before the  Stone Age aren't related to anything else there. We have to conclude  that Man didn't originate on any of the planets on which he is now  found. Instead, he evolved elsewhere and later was scattered throughout  this section of the Milky Way.\"\n\n\n \"And so, to account for the unique race that can interbreed across  thousands of light-years, you've brought in the big ancestor,\"  commented Taphetta dryly. \"It seems an unnecessary simplification.\"\n\n\n \"Can you think of a better explanation?\" asked Kelburn.\n\n\n \"Something had to distribute one species so widely and it's not the  result of parallel evolution\u2014not when a hundred human races are  involved, and only the human race.\"\n\n\n \"I can't think of a better explanation.\" Taphetta rearranged his  ribbons. \"Frankly, no one else is much interested in Man's theories  about himself.\"\n\n\n It was easy to understand the attitude. Man was the most numerous  though not always the most advanced\u2014Ribboneers had a civilization as  high as anything in the known section of the Milky Way, and there were  others\u2014and humans were more than a little feared. If they ever got  together\u2014but they hadn't except in agreement as to their common origin.\n\n\n Still, Taphetta the Ribboneer was an experienced pilot and could be  very useful. A clear statement of their position was essential in  helping him make up his mind. \"You've heard of the adjacency mating  principle?\" asked Sam Halden.\n\n\n \"Vaguely. Most people have if they've been around men.\"\n\n\n \"We've got new data and are able to interpret it better. The theory is  that humans who can mate with each other were once physically close.  We've got a list of all our races arranged in sequence. If planetary  race F can mate with race E back to A and forward to M, and race G is  fertile only back to B, but forward to O, then we assume that whatever  their positions are now, at once time G was actually adjacent to F, but  was a little further along. When we project back into time those star  systems on which humans existed prior to space travel, we get a certain  pattern. Kelburn can explain it to you.\"\n\n\n The normally pink body of the Ribboneer flushed slightly. The color  change was almost imperceptible, but it was enough to indicate that he  was interested. Kelburn went to the projector. \"It would be easier if we knew all the  stars in the Milky Way, but though we've explored only a small portion  of it, we can reconstruct a fairly accurate representation of the past.\"\n\n\n He pressed the controls and stars twinkled on the screen. \"We're  looking down on the plane of the Galaxy. This is one arm of it as it is  today and here are the human systems.\" He pressed another control and,  for purposes of identification, certain stars became more brilliant.  There was no pattern, merely a scattering of stars. \"The whole Milky  Way is rotating. And while stars in a given region tend to remain  together, there's also a random motion. Here's what happens when we  calculate the positions of stars in the past.\"\n\n\n Flecks of light shifted and flowed across the screen. Kelburn stopped  the motion.\n\n\n \"Two hundred thousand years ago,\" he said.\n\n\n There was a pattern of the identified stars. They were spaced at fairly  equal intervals along a regular curve, a horseshoe loop that didn't  close, though if the ends were extended, the lines would have crossed.\n\n\n Taphetta rustled. \"The math is accurate?\"\n\n\n \"As accurate as it can be with a million-plus body problem.\"\n\n\n \"And that's the hypothetical route of the unknown ancestor?\"\n\n\n \"To the best of our knowledge,\" said Kelburn. \"And whereas there are  humans who are relatively near and not fertile, they can always mate  with those they were adjacent to two hundred thousand years ago !\"\n\n\n \"The adjacency mating principle. I've never seen it demonstrated,\"  murmured Taphetta, flexing his ribbons. \"Is that the only era that  satisfies the calculations?\"\n\n\n \"Plus or minus a hundred thousand years, we can still get something  that might be the path of a spaceship attempting to cover a  representative section of territory,\" said Kelburn. \"However, we have  other ways of dating it. On some worlds on which there are no other  mammals, we're able to place the first human fossils chronologically.  The evidence is sometimes contradictory, but we believe we've got the  time right.\"\n\n\n Taphetta waved a ribbon at the chart. \"And you think that where the two  ends of the curve cross is your original home?\"\n\n\n \"We think so,\" said Kelburn. \"We've narrowed it down to several cubic  light-years\u2014then. Now it's far more. And, of course, if it were a  fast-moving star, it might be completely out of the field of our  exploration. But we're certain we've got a good chance of finding it  this trip.\"\n\n\n \"It seems I must decide quickly.\" The Ribboneer glanced out the  visionport, where another ship hung motionless in space beside them.  \"Do you mind if I ask other questions?\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead,\" Kelburn invited sardonically. \"But if it's not math, you'd  better ask Halden. He's the leader of the expedition.\"\n\n\n Halden flushed; the sarcasm wasn't necessary. It was true that Kelburn  was the most advanced human type present, but while there were  differences, biological and in the scale of intelligence, it wasn't  as great as once was thought. Anyway, non-humans weren't trained in  the fine distinctions that men made among themselves. And, higher or  lower, he was as good a biologist as the other was a mathematician. And  there was the matter of training; he'd been on several expeditions and  this was Kelburn's first trip. Damn it, he thought, that rated some  respect.\n\n\n The Ribboneer shifted his attention. \"Aside from the sudden illness of  your pilot, why did you ask for me?\"\n\n\n \"We didn't. The man became sick and required treatment we can't give  him. Luckily, a ship was passing and we hailed it because it's four  months to the nearest planet. They consented to take him back and told  us that there was a passenger on board who was an experienced pilot. We  have men who could do the job in a makeshift fashion, but the region  we're heading for, while mapped, is largely unknown. We'd prefer to  have an expert\u2014and Ribboneers are famous for their navigational  ability.\"\n\n\n Taphetta crinkled politely at the reference to his skill. \"I had other  plans, but I can't evade professional obligations, and an emergency  such as this should cancel out any previous agreements. Still, what are  the incentives?\"\n\n\n Sam Halden coughed. \"The usual, plus a little extra. We've copied the  Ribboneer's standard nature, simplifying it a little and adding a per  cent here and there for the crew pilot and scientist's share of the  profits from any discoveries we may make.\"\n\n\n \"I'm complimented that you like our contract so well,\" said Taphetta,  \"but I really must have our own unsimplified version. If you want me,  you'll take my contract. I came prepared.\" He extended a tightly bound  roll that he had kept somewhere on his person.\n\n\n They glanced at one another as Halden took it.\n\n\n \"You can read it if you want,\" offered Taphetta. \"But it will take  you all day\u2014it's micro-printing. However, you needn't be afraid that  I'm defrauding you. It's honored everywhere we go and we go nearly  everywhere in this sector\u2014places men have never been.\"\n\n\n There was no choice if they wanted him, and they did. Besides, the  integrity of Ribboneers was not to be questioned. Halden signed.\n\n\n \"Good.\" Taphetta crinkled. \"Send it to the ship; they'll forward it  for me. And you can tell the ship to go on without me.\" He rubbed his  ribbons together. \"Now if you'll get me the charts, I'll examine the  region toward which we're heading.\" Firmon of hydroponics slouched in, a tall man with scanty hair and  an equal lack of grace. He seemed to have difficulty in taking his  eyes off Meredith, though, since he was a notch or so above her in the  mating scale, he shouldn't have been so interested. But his planet had  been inexplicably slow in developing and he wasn't completely aware of  his place in the human hierarchy.\n\n\n Disdainfully, Meredith adjusted a skirt that, a few inches shorter,  wouldn't have been a skirt at all, revealing, while doing so, just how  long and beautiful a woman's legs could be. Her people had never given  much thought to physical modesty and, with legs like that, it was easy  to see why.\n\n\n Muttering something about primitive women, Firmon turned to the  biologist. \"The pilot doesn't like our air.\"\n\n\n \"Then change it to suit him. He's in charge of the ship and knows more  about these things than I do.\"\n\n\n \"More than a man?\" Firmon leered at Meredith and, when she failed  to smile, added plaintively, \"I did try to change it, but he still  complains.\" Halden took a deep breath. \"Seems all right to me.\"\n\n\n \"To everybody else, too, but the tapeworm hasn't got lungs. He breathes  through a million tubes scattered over his body.\"\n\n\n It would do no good to explain that Taphetta wasn't a worm, that his  evolution had taken a different course, but that he was in no sense  less complex than Man. It was a paradox that some biologically higher  humans hadn't developed as much as lower races and actually weren't  prepared for the multitude of life-forms they'd meet in space. Firmon's  reaction was quite typical.\n\n\n \"If he asks for cleaner air, it's because his system needs it,\" said  Halden. \"Do anything you can to give it to him.\"\n\n\n \"Can't. This is as good as I can get it. Taphetta thought you could do  something about it.\"\n\n\n \"Hydroponics is your job. There's nothing I can do.\" Halden paused  thoughtfully. \"Is there something wrong with the plants?\"\n\n\n \"In a way, I guess, and yet not really.\"\n\n\n \"What is it, some kind of toxic condition?\"\n\n\n \"The plants are healthy enough, but something's chewing them down as  fast as they grow.\"\n\n\n \"Insects? There shouldn't be any, but if there are, we've got sprays.  Use them.\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal,\" said Firmon. \"We tried poison and got a few, but now  they won't touch the stuff. I had electronics rig up some traps. The  animals seem to know what they are and we've never caught one that  way.\"\n\n\n Halden glowered at the man. \"How long has this been going on?\"\n\n\n \"About three months. It's not bad; we can keep up with them.\"\n\n\n It was probably nothing to become alarmed at, but an animal on the ship  was a nuisance, doubly so because of their pilot.\n\n\n \"Tell me what you know about it,\" said Halden.\n\n\n \"They're little things.\" Firmon held out his hands to show how small.  \"I don't know how they got on, but once they did, there were plenty of  places to hide.\" He looked up defensively. \"This is an old ship with  new equipment and they hide under the machinery. There's nothing we can  do except rebuild the ship from the hull inward.\"\n\n\n Firmon was right. The new equipment had been installed in any place  just to get it in and now there were inaccessible corners and crevices  everywhere that couldn't be closed off without rebuilding.\n\n\n They couldn't set up a continuous watch and shoot the animals down  because there weren't that many men to spare. Besides, the use of  weapons in hydroponics would cause more damage to the thing they were  trying to protect than to the pest. He'd have to devise other ways.\n\n\n Sam Halden got up. \"I'll take a look and see what I can do.\"\n\n\n \"I'll come along and help,\" said Meredith, untwining her legs and  leaning against him. \"Your mistress ought to have some sort of  privileges.\"\n\n\n Halden started. So she knew that the crew was calling her that!  Perhaps it was intended to discourage Firmon, but he wished she hadn't  said it. It didn't help the situation at all. Taphetta sat in a chair designed for humans. With a less flexible body,  he wouldn't have fitted. Maybe it wasn't sitting, but his flat legs  were folded neatly around the arms and his head rested comfortably on  the seat. The head ribbons, which were his hands and voice, were never  quite still.\n\n\n He looked from Halden to Emmer and back again. \"The hydroponics tech  tells me you're contemplating an experiment. I don't like it.\"\n\n\n Halden shrugged. \"We've got to have better air. It might work.\"\n\n\n \"Pests on the ship? It's filthy! My people would never tolerate it!\"\n\n\n \"Neither do we.\"\n\n\n The Ribboneer's distaste subsided. \"What kind of creatures are they?\"\n\n\n \"I have a description, though I've never seen one. It's a small  four-legged animal with two antennae at the lower base of its skull. A  typical pest.\"\n\n\n Taphetta rustled. \"Have you found out how it got on?\"\n\n\n \"It was probably brought in with the supplies,\" said the biologist.  \"Considering how far we've come, it may have been any one of a half  a dozen planets. Anyway, it hid, and since most of the places it had  access to were near the outer hull, it got an extra dose of hard  radiation, or it may have nested near the atomic engines; both are  possibilities. Either way, it mutated, became a different animal. It's  developed a tolerance for the poisons we spray on plants. Other things  it detects and avoids, even electronic traps.\"\n\n\n \"Then you believe it changed mentally as well as physically, that it's  smarter?\"\n\n\n \"I'd say that, yes. It must be a fairly intelligent creature to be  so hard to get rid of. But it can be lured into traps, if the bait's  strong enough.\"\n\n\n \"That's what I don't like,\" said Taphetta, curling. \"Let me think it  over while I ask questions.\" He turned to Emmer. \"I'm curious about  humans. Is there anything else you can tell me about the hypothetical  ancestor?\"\n\n\n Emmer didn't look like the genius he was\u2014a Neanderthal genius, but  nonetheless a real one. In his field, he rated very high. He raised a  stubble-flecked cheek from a large thick-fingered paw and ran shaggy  hands through shaggier hair.\n\n\n \"I can speak with some authority,\" he rumbled. \"I was born on a world  with the most extensive relics. As a child, I played in the ruins of  their camp.\"\n\n\n \"I don't question your authority,\" crinkled Taphetta. \"To me, all  humans\u2014late or early and male or female\u2014look remarkably alike. If you  are an archeologist, that's enough for me.\" He paused and flicked his  speech ribbons. \"Camp, did you say?\" Emmer smiled, unsheathing great teeth. \"You've never seen any pictures?  Impressive, but just a camp, monolithic one-story structures, and  we'd give something to know what they're made of. Presumably my world  was one of the first they stopped at. They weren't used to roughing  it, so they built more elaborately than they did later on. One-story  structures and that's how we can guess at their size. The doorways were  forty feet high.\"\n\n\n \"Very large,\" agreed Taphetta. It was difficult to tell whether he was  impressed. \"What did you find in the ruins?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing,\" said Emmer. \"There were buildings there and that was all,  not a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture. They covered  a route estimated at thirty thousand light-years in less than five  thousand years\u2014and not one of them died that we have a record of.\"\n\n\n \"A faster-than-light drive and an extremely long life,\" mused Taphetta.  \"But they didn't leave any information for their descendants. Why?\"\n\n\n \"Who knows? Their mental processes were certainly far different from  ours. They may have thought we'd be better off without it. We do know  they were looking for a special kind of planet, like Earth, because  they visited so many of that type, yet different from it because they  never stayed. They were pretty special people themselves, big and  long-lived, and maybe they couldn't survive on any planet they found.  Perhaps they had ways of determining there wasn't the kind of planet  they needed in the entire Milky Way. Their science was tremendously  advanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germ  plasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of us  did.\"\n\n\n \"This special planet sounds strange,\" murmured Taphetta.\n\n\n \"Not really,\" said Emmer. \"Fifty human races reached space travel  independently and those who did were scattered equally among early and  late species. It's well known that individuals among my people are  often as bright as any of Halden's or Meredith's, but as a whole we  don't have the total capacity that later Man does, and yet we're as  advanced in civilization. The difference? It must lie somewhere in the  planets we live on and it's hard to say just what it is.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to those who didn't develop space travel?\" asked  Taphetta.\n\n\n \"We helped them,\" said Emmer.\n\n\n And they had, no matter who or what they were, biologically late  or early, in the depths of the bronze age or the threshold of  atomic\u2014because they were human. That was sometimes a frightening thing  for non-humans, that the race stuck together. They weren't actually  aggressive, but their total number was great and they held themselves  aloof. The unknown ancestor again. Who else had such an origin and, it  was tacitly assumed, such a destiny? Taphetta changed his questioning. \"What do you expect to gain from this  discovery of the unknown ancestor?\"\n\n\n It was Halden who answered him. \"There's the satisfaction of knowing  where we came from.\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" rustled the Ribboneer. \"But a lot of money and equipment  was required for this expedition. I can't believe that the educational  institutions that are backing you did so purely out of intellectual  curiosity.\"\n\n\n \"Cultural discoveries,\" rumbled Emmer. \"How did our ancestors live?  When a creature is greatly reduced in size, as we are, more than  physiology is changed\u2014the pattern of life itself is altered. Things  that were easy for them are impossible for us. Look at their life span.\"\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" said Taphetta. \"An archeologist would be interested in  cultural discoveries.\"\n\n\n \"Two hundred thousand years ago, they had an extremely advanced  civilization,\" added Halden. \"A faster-than-light drive, and we've  achieved that only within the last thousand years.\"\n\n\n \"But I think we have a better one than they did,\" said the Ribboneer.  \"There may be things we can learn from them in mechanics or physics,  but wouldn't you say they were better biologists than anything else?\"\n\n\n Halden nodded. \"Agreed. They couldn't find a suitable planet. So,  working directly with their germ plasm, they modified themselves and  produced us. They were master biologists.\"\n\n\n \"I thought so,\" said Taphetta. \"I never paid much attention to your  fantastic theories before I signed to pilot this ship, but you've built  up a convincing case.\" He raised his head, speech ribbons curling  fractionally and ceaselessly. \"I don't like to, but we'll have to risk  using bait for your pest.\"\n\n\n He'd have done it anyway, but it was better to have the pilot's  consent. And there was one question Halden wanted to ask; it had been  bothering him vaguely. \"What's the difference between the Ribboneer  contract and the one we offered you? Our terms are more liberal.\"\n\n\n \"To the individual, they are, but it won't matter if you discover as  much as you think you will. The difference is this: My terms don't  permit you to withhold any discovery for the benefit of one race.\"\n\n\n Taphetta was wrong; there had been no intention of withholding  anything. Halden examined his own attitudes. He hadn't intended, but  could he say that was true of the institutions backing the expedition?  He couldn't, and it was too late now\u2014whatever knowledge they acquired  would have to be shared.\n\n\n That was what Taphetta had been afraid of\u2014there was one kind of  technical advancement that multiplied unceasingly. The race that could  improve itself through scientific control of its germ plasm had a start  that could never be headed. The Ribboneer needn't worry now. \"Why do we have to watch it on the screen?\" asked Meredith, glancing  up. \"I'd rather be in hydroponics.\"\n\n\n Halden shrugged. \"They may or may not be smarter than planetbound  animals, but they're warier. They don't come out when anyone's near.\"\n\n\n Lights dimmed in the distant hydroponic section and the screen with  it, until he adjusted the infra-red frequencies. He motioned to the  two crew members, each with his own peculiar screen, below which was a  miniature keyboard.\n\n\n \"Ready?\"\n\n\n When they nodded, Halden said: \"Do as you've rehearsed. Keep noise at  a minimum, but when you do use it, be vague. Don't try to imitate them  exactly.\"\n\n\n At first, nothing happened on the big screen, and then a gray shape  crept out. It slid through leaves, listened intently before coming  forward. It jumped off one hydroponic section and fled across the open  floor to the next. It paused, eyes glittering and antennae twitching.\n\n\n Looking around once, it leaped up, seizing the ledge and clawing up the  side of the tank. Standing on top and rising to its haunches, it began  nibbling what it could reach.\n\n\n Suddenly it whirled. Behind it and hitherto unnoticed was another  shape, like it but larger. The newcomer inched forward. The small one  retreated, skittering nervously. Without warning, the big one leaped  and the small one tried to flee. In a few jumps, the big one caught up  and mauled the other unmercifully. It continued to bite even after the little one lay still. At last it  backed off and waited, watching for signs of motion. There was none.  Then it turned to the plant. When it had chewed off everything within  reach, it climbed into the branches.\n\n\n The little one twitched, moved a leg, and cautiously began dragging  itself away. It rolled off the raised section and surprisingly made no  noise as it fell. It seemed to revive, shaking itself and scurrying  away, still within range of the screen.\n\n\n Against the wall was a small platform. The little one climbed on top  and there found something that seemed to interest it. It sniffed  around and reached and felt the discovery. Wounds were forgotten as  it snatched up the object and frisked back to the scene of its recent  defeat.\n\n\n This time it had no trouble with the raised section. It leaped and  landed on top and made considerable noise in doing so. The big animal  heard and twisted around. It saw and clambered down hastily, jumping  the last few feet. Squealing, it hit the floor and charged.\n\n\n The small one stood still till the last instant\u2014and then a paw  flickered out and an inch-long knife blade plunged into the throat of  the charging creature. Red spurted out as the bigger beast screamed.  The knife flashed in and out until the big animal collapsed and stopped  moving.\n\n\n The small creature removed the knife and wiped it on the pelt of its  foe. Then it scampered back to the platform on which the knife had been  found\u2014 and laid it down . At Halden's signal, the lights flared up and the screen became too  bright for anything to be visible.\n\n\n \"Go in and get them,\" said Halden. \"We don't want the pests to find out  that the bodies aren't flesh.\"\n\n\n \"It was realistic enough,\" said Meredith as the crewmen shut off their  machines and went out. \"Do you think it will work?\"\n\n\n \"It might. We had an audience.\"\n\n\n \"Did we? I didn't notice.\" Meredith leaned back. \"Were the puppets  exactly like the pests? And if not, will the pests be fooled?\"\n\n\n \"The electronic puppets were a good imitation, but the animals don't  have to identify them as their species. If they're smart enough,  they'll know the value of a knife, no matter who uses it.\"\n\n\n \"What if they're smarter? Suppose they know a knife can't be used by a  creature without real hands?\"\n\n\n \"That's part of our precautions. They'll never know until they try\u2014and  they'll never get away from the trap to try.\"\n\n\n \"Very good. I never thought of that,\" said Meredith, coming closer. \"I  like the way your primitive mind works. At times I actually think of  marrying you.\"\n\n\n \"Primitive,\" he said, alternately frozen and thawed, though he knew  that, in relation to her, he was not advanced.\n\n\n \"It's almost a curse, isn't it?\" She laughed and took the curse away by  leaning provocatively against him. \"But barbaric lovers are often nice.\"\n\n\n Here we go again, he thought drearily, sliding his arm around her. To  her, I'm merely a passionate savage.\n\n\n They went to his cabin.\n\n\n She sat down, smiling. Was she pretty? Maybe. For her own race, she  wasn't tall, only by Terran standards. Her legs were disproportionately  long and well shaped and her face was somewhat bland and featureless,  except for a thin, straight, short nose. It was her eyes that made  the difference, he decided. A notch or two up the scale of visual  development, her eyes were larger and she could see an extra color on  the violet end of the spectrum.\n\n\n She settled back and looked at him. \"It might be fun living with you on  primeval Earth.\"\n\n\n He said nothing; she knew as well as he that Earth was as advanced as  her own world. She had something else in mind.\n\n\n \"I don't think I will, though. We might have children.\"\n\n\n \"Would it be wrong?\" he asked. \"I'm as intelligent as you. We wouldn't  have subhuman monsters.\"\n\n\n \"It would be a step up\u2014for you.\" Under her calm, there was tension.  It had been there as long as he'd known her, but it was closer to the  surface now. \"Do I have the right to condemn the unborn? Should I make  them start lower than I am?\"\n\n\n The conflict was not new nor confined to them. In one form or another,  it governed personal relations between races that were united against  non-humans, but held sharp distinctions themselves.\n\n\n \"I haven't asked you to marry me,\" he said bluntly.\n\n\n \"Because you're afraid I'd refuse.\"\n\n\n It was true; no one asked a member of a higher race to enter a  permanent union.\n\n\n \"Why did you ever have anything to do with me?\" demanded Halden.\n\n\n \"Love,\" she said gloomily. \"Physical attraction. But I can't let it  lead me astray.\"\n\n\n \"Why not make a play for Kelburn? If you're going to be scientific  about it, he'd give you children of the higher type.\"\n\n\n \"Kelburn.\" It didn't sound like a name, the way she said it. \"I don't  like him and he wouldn't marry me.\"\n\n\n \"He wouldn't, but he'd give you children if you were humble enough.  There's a fifty per cent chance you might conceive.\" She provocatively arched her back. Not even the women of Kelburn's race  had a body like hers and she knew it.\n\n\n \"Racially, there should be a chance,\" she said. \"Actually, Kelburn and  I would be infertile.\"\n\n\n \"Can you be sure?\" he asked, knowing it was a poor attempt to act  unconcerned.\n\n\n \"How can anyone be sure on a theoretical basis?\" she asked, an oblique  smile narrowing her eyes. \"I know we can't.\"\n\n\n His face felt anesthetized. \"Did you have to tell me that?\"\n\n\n She got up and came to him. She nuzzled against him and his reaction  was purely reflexive. His hand swung out and he could feel the flesh  give when his knuckles struck it.\n\n\n She fell back and dazedly covered her face with her hand. When she took  it away, blood spurted. She groped toward the mirror and stood in front  of it. She wiped the blood off, examining her features carefully.\n\n\n \"You've broken my nose,\" she said factually. \"I'll have to stop the  blood and pain.\"\n\n\n She pushed her nose back into place and waggled it to make sure. She  closed her eyes and stood silent and motionless. Then she stepped back  and looked at herself critically.\n\n\n \"It's set and partially knitted. I'll concentrate tonight and have it  healed by morning.\"\n\n\n She felt in the cabinet and attached an invisible strip firmly across  the bridge. Then she came over to him.\n\n\n \"I wondered what you'd do. You didn't disappoint me.\"\n\n\n He scowled miserably at her. Her face was almost plain and the bandage,  invisible or not, didn't improve her appearance any. How could he still  feel that attraction to her?\n\n\n \"Try Emmer,\" he suggested tiredly. \"He'll find you irresistible, and  he's even more savage than I am.\"\n\n\n \"Is he?\" She smiled enigmatically. \"Maybe, in a biological sense. Too  much, though. You're just right.\"\n\n\n He sat down on the bed. Again there was only one way of knowing what  Emmer would do\u2014and she knew. She had no concept of love outside of  the physical, to make use of her body so as to gain an advantage\u2014what  advantage?\u2014for the children she intended to have. Outside of that,  nothing mattered, and for the sake of alloying the lower with the  higher, she was as cruel to herself as she was to him. And yet he  wanted her.\n\n\n \"I do think I love you,\" she said. \"And if love's enough, I may marry  you in spite of everything. But you'll have to watch out whose children  I have.\" She wriggled into his arms.\n\n\n The racial disparity was great and she had provoked him, but it was not  completely her fault. Besides....\n\n\n Besides what? She had a beautiful body that could bear superior  children\u2014and they might be his.\n\n\n He twisted away. With those thoughts, he was as bad as she was. Were  they all that way, every one of them, crawling upward out of the slime  toward the highest goal they could conceive of? Climbing over\u2014no, through \u2014everybody they could coerce, seduce or marry\u2014onward and  upward. He raised his hand, but it was against himself that his anger  was turned.\n\n\n \"Careful of the nose,\" she said, pressing against him. \"You've already  broken it once.\"\n\n\n He kissed her with sudden passion that even he knew was primitive.

L. WALLACE\n\n\n Illustrated by EMSH\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction November 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Man's family tree was awesome enough to give every galactic   race an inferiority complex\u2014but then he tried to climb it! In repose, Taphetta the Ribboneer resembled a fancy giant bow on a  package. His four flat legs looped out and in, the ends tucked under  his wide, thin body, which constituted the knot at the middle. His neck  was flat, too, arching out in another loop. Of all his features, only  his head had appreciable thickness and it was crowned with a dozen long  though narrower ribbons.\n\n\n Taphetta rattled the head fronds together in a surprisingly good  imitation of speech. \"Yes, I've heard the legend.\"\n\n\n \"It's more than a legend,\" said Sam Halden, biologist. The reaction was  not unexpected\u2014non-humans tended to dismiss the data as convenient  speculation and nothing more. \"There are at least a hundred kinds of  humans, each supposedly originating in strict seclusion on as many  widely scattered planets. Obviously there was no contact throughout the  ages before space travel\u2014 and yet each planetary race can interbreed  with a minimum of ten others ! That's more than a legend\u2014one hell of a  lot more!\"\n\n\n \"It is impressive,\" admitted Taphetta. \"But I find it mildly  distasteful to consider mating with someone who does not belong to my  species.\"\n\n\n \"That's because you're unique,\" said Halden. \"Outside of your own  world, there's nothing like your species, except superficially, and  that's true of all other creatures, intelligent or not, with the sole  exception of mankind. Actually, the four of us here, though it's  accidental, very nearly represent the biological spectrum of human  development. \"Emmer, a Neanderthal type and our archeologist, is around the  beginning of the scale. I'm from Earth, near the middle, though on  Emmer's side. Meredith, linguist, is on the other side of the middle.  And beyond her, toward the far end, is Kelburn, mathematician. There's  a corresponding span of fertility. Emmer just misses being able to  breed with my kind, but there's a fair chance that I'd be fertile with  Meredith and a similar though lesser chance that her fertility may  extend to Kelburn.\" Taphetta rustled his speech ribbons quizzically. \"But I thought it was  proved that some humans did originate on one planet, that there was an  unbroken line of evolution that could be traced back a billion years.\"\n\n\n \"You're thinking of Earth,\" said Halden. \"Humans require a certain kind  of planet. It's reasonable to assume that, if men were set down on a  hundred such worlds, they'd seem to fit in with native life-forms on a  few of them. That's what happened on Earth; when Man arrived, there was  actually a manlike creature there. Naturally our early evolutionists  stretched their theories to cover the facts they had.\n\n\n \"But there are other worlds in which humans who were there before the  Stone Age aren't related to anything else there. We have to conclude  that Man didn't originate on any of the planets on which he is now  found. Instead, he evolved elsewhere and later was scattered throughout  this section of the Milky Way.\"\n\n\n \"And so, to account for the unique race that can interbreed across  thousands of light-years, you've brought in the big ancestor,\"  commented Taphetta dryly. \"It seems an unnecessary simplification.\"\n\n\n \"Can you think of a better explanation?\" asked Kelburn.\n\n\n \"Something had to distribute one species so widely and it's not the  result of parallel evolution\u2014not when a hundred human races are  involved, and only the human race.\"\n\n\n \"I can't think of a better explanation.\" Taphetta rearranged his  ribbons. \"Frankly, no one else is much interested in Man's theories  about himself.\"\n\n\n It was easy to understand the attitude. Man was the most numerous  though not always the most advanced\u2014Ribboneers had a civilization as  high as anything in the known section of the Milky Way, and there were  others\u2014and humans were more than a little feared. If they ever got  together\u2014but they hadn't except in agreement as to their common origin.\n\n\n Still, Taphetta the Ribboneer was an experienced pilot and could be  very useful. A clear statement of their position was essential in  helping him make up his mind. \"You've heard of the adjacency mating  principle?\" asked Sam Halden.\n\n\n \"Vaguely. Most people have if they've been around men.\"\n\n\n \"We've got new data and are able to interpret it better. The theory is  that humans who can mate with each other were once physically close.  We've got a list of all our races arranged in sequence. If planetary  race F can mate with race E back to A and forward to M, and race G is  fertile only back to B, but forward to O, then we assume that whatever  their positions are now, at once time G was actually adjacent to F, but  was a little further along. When we project back into time those star  systems on which humans existed prior to space travel, we get a certain  pattern. Kelburn can explain it to you.\"\n\n\n The normally pink body of the Ribboneer flushed slightly. The color  change was almost imperceptible, but it was enough to indicate that he  was interested. Kelburn went to the projector. \"It would be easier if we knew all the  stars in the Milky Way, but though we've explored only a small portion  of it, we can reconstruct a fairly accurate representation of the past.\"\n\n\n He pressed the controls and stars twinkled on the screen. \"We're  looking down on the plane of the Galaxy. This is one arm of it as it is  today and here are the human systems.\" He pressed another control and,  for purposes of identification, certain stars became more brilliant.  There was no pattern, merely a scattering of stars. \"The whole Milky  Way is rotating. And while stars in a given region tend to remain  together, there's also a random motion. Here's what happens when we  calculate the positions of stars in the past.\"\n\n\n Flecks of light shifted and flowed across the screen. Kelburn stopped  the motion.\n\n\n \"Two hundred thousand years ago,\" he said.\n\n\n There was a pattern of the identified stars. They were spaced at fairly  equal intervals along a regular curve, a horseshoe loop that didn't  close, though if the ends were extended, the lines would have crossed.\n\n\n Taphetta rustled. \"The math is accurate?\"\n\n\n \"As accurate as it can be with a million-plus body problem.\"\n\n\n \"And that's the hypothetical route of the unknown ancestor?\"\n\n\n \"To the best of our knowledge,\" said Kelburn. \"And whereas there are  humans who are relatively near and not fertile, they can always mate  with those they were adjacent to two hundred thousand years ago !\"\n\n\n \"The adjacency mating principle. I've never seen it demonstrated,\"  murmured Taphetta, flexing his ribbons. \"Is that the only era that  satisfies the calculations?\"\n\n\n \"Plus or minus a hundred thousand years, we can still get something  that might be the path of a spaceship attempting to cover a  representative section of territory,\" said Kelburn. \"However, we have  other ways of dating it. On some worlds on which there are no other  mammals, we're able to place the first human fossils chronologically.  The evidence is sometimes contradictory, but we believe we've got the  time right.\"\n\n\n Taphetta waved a ribbon at the chart. \"And you think that where the two  ends of the curve cross is your original home?\"\n\n\n \"We think so,\" said Kelburn. \"We've narrowed it down to several cubic  light-years\u2014then. Now it's far more. And, of course, if it were a  fast-moving star, it might be completely out of the field of our  exploration. But we're certain we've got a good chance of finding it  this trip.\"\n\n\n \"It seems I must decide quickly.\" The Ribboneer glanced out the  visionport, where another ship hung motionless in space beside them.  \"Do you mind if I ask other questions?\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead,\" Kelburn invited sardonically. \"But if it's not math, you'd  better ask Halden. He's the leader of the expedition.\"\n\n\n Halden flushed; the sarcasm wasn't necessary. It was true that Kelburn  was the most advanced human type present, but while there were  differences, biological and in the scale of intelligence, it wasn't  as great as once was thought. Anyway, non-humans weren't trained in  the fine distinctions that men made among themselves. And, higher or  lower, he was as good a biologist as the other was a mathematician. And  there was the matter of training; he'd been on several expeditions and  this was Kelburn's first trip. Damn it, he thought, that rated some  respect.\n\n\n The Ribboneer shifted his attention. \"Aside from the sudden illness of  your pilot, why did you ask for me?\"\n\n\n \"We didn't. The man became sick and required treatment we can't give  him. Luckily, a ship was passing and we hailed it because it's four  months to the nearest planet. They consented to take him back and told  us that there was a passenger on board who was an experienced pilot. We  have men who could do the job in a makeshift fashion, but the region  we're heading for, while mapped, is largely unknown. We'd prefer to  have an expert\u2014and Ribboneers are famous for their navigational  ability.\"\n\n\n Taphetta crinkled politely at the reference to his skill. \"I had other  plans, but I can't evade professional obligations, and an emergency  such as this should cancel out any previous agreements. Still, what are  the incentives?\"\n\n\n Sam Halden coughed. \"The usual, plus a little extra. We've copied the  Ribboneer's standard nature, simplifying it a little and adding a per  cent here and there for the crew pilot and scientist's share of the  profits from any discoveries we may make.\"\n\n\n \"I'm complimented that you like our contract so well,\" said Taphetta,  \"but I really must have our own unsimplified version. If you want me,  you'll take my contract. I came prepared.\" He extended a tightly bound  roll that he had kept somewhere on his person.\n\n\n They glanced at one another as Halden took it.\n\n\n \"You can read it if you want,\" offered Taphetta. \"But it will take  you all day\u2014it's micro-printing. However, you needn't be afraid that  I'm defrauding you. It's honored everywhere we go and we go nearly  everywhere in this sector\u2014places men have never been.\"\n\n\n There was no choice if they wanted him, and they did. Besides, the  integrity of Ribboneers was not to be questioned. Halden signed.\n\n\n \"Good.\" Taphetta crinkled. \"Send it to the ship; they'll forward it  for me. And you can tell the ship to go on without me.\" He rubbed his  ribbons together. \"Now if you'll get me the charts, I'll examine the  region toward which we're heading.\" Firmon of hydroponics slouched in, a tall man with scanty hair and  an equal lack of grace. He seemed to have difficulty in taking his  eyes off Meredith, though, since he was a notch or so above her in the  mating scale, he shouldn't have been so interested. But his planet had  been inexplicably slow in developing and he wasn't completely aware of  his place in the human hierarchy.\n\n\n Disdainfully, Meredith adjusted a skirt that, a few inches shorter,  wouldn't have been a skirt at all, revealing, while doing so, just how  long and beautiful a woman's legs could be. Her people had never given  much thought to physical modesty and, with legs like that, it was easy  to see why.\n\n\n Muttering something about primitive women, Firmon turned to the  biologist. \"The pilot doesn't like our air.\"\n\n\n \"Then change it to suit him. He's in charge of the ship and knows more  about these things than I do.\"\n\n\n \"More than a man?\" Firmon leered at Meredith and, when she failed  to smile, added plaintively, \"I did try to change it, but he still  complains.\" Halden took a deep breath. \"Seems all right to me.\"\n\n\n \"To everybody else, too, but the tapeworm hasn't got lungs. He breathes  through a million tubes scattered over his body.\"\n\n\n It would do no good to explain that Taphetta wasn't a worm, that his  evolution had taken a different course, but that he was in no sense  less complex than Man. It was a paradox that some biologically higher  humans hadn't developed as much as lower races and actually weren't  prepared for the multitude of life-forms they'd meet in space. Firmon's  reaction was quite typical.\n\n\n \"If he asks for cleaner air, it's because his system needs it,\" said  Halden. \"Do anything you can to give it to him.\"\n\n\n \"Can't. This is as good as I can get it. Taphetta thought you could do  something about it.\"\n\n\n \"Hydroponics is your job. There's nothing I can do.\" Halden paused  thoughtfully. \"Is there something wrong with the plants?\"\n\n\n \"In a way, I guess, and yet not really.\"\n\n\n \"What is it, some kind of toxic condition?\"\n\n\n \"The plants are healthy enough, but something's chewing them down as  fast as they grow.\"\n\n\n \"Insects? There shouldn't be any, but if there are, we've got sprays.  Use them.\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal,\" said Firmon. \"We tried poison and got a few, but now  they won't touch the stuff. I had electronics rig up some traps. The  animals seem to know what they are and we've never caught one that  way.\"\n\n\n Halden glowered at the man. \"How long has this been going on?\"\n\n\n \"About three months. It's not bad; we can keep up with them.\"\n\n\n It was probably nothing to become alarmed at, but an animal on the ship  was a nuisance, doubly so because of their pilot.\n\n\n \"Tell me what you know about it,\" said Halden.\n\n\n \"They're little things.\" Firmon held out his hands to show how small.  \"I don't know how they got on, but once they did, there were plenty of  places to hide.\" He looked up defensively. \"This is an old ship with  new equipment and they hide under the machinery. There's nothing we can  do except rebuild the ship from the hull inward.\"\n\n\n Firmon was right. The new equipment had been installed in any place  just to get it in and now there were inaccessible corners and crevices  everywhere that couldn't be closed off without rebuilding.\n\n\n They couldn't set up a continuous watch and shoot the animals down  because there weren't that many men to spare. Besides, the use of  weapons in hydroponics would cause more damage to the thing they were  trying to protect than to the pest. He'd have to devise other ways.\n\n\n Sam Halden got up. \"I'll take a look and see what I can do.\"\n\n\n \"I'll come along and help,\" said Meredith, untwining her legs and  leaning against him. \"Your mistress ought to have some sort of  privileges.\"\n\n\n Halden started. So she knew that the crew was calling her that!  Perhaps it was intended to discourage Firmon, but he wished she hadn't  said it. It didn't help the situation at all. Taphetta sat in a chair designed for humans. With a less flexible body,  he wouldn't have fitted. Maybe it wasn't sitting, but his flat legs  were folded neatly around the arms and his head rested comfortably on  the seat. The head ribbons, which were his hands and voice, were never  quite still.\n\n\n He looked from Halden to Emmer and back again. \"The hydroponics tech  tells me you're contemplating an experiment. I don't like it.\"\n\n\n Halden shrugged. \"We've got to have better air. It might work.\"\n\n\n \"Pests on the ship? It's filthy! My people would never tolerate it!\"\n\n\n \"Neither do we.\"\n\n\n The Ribboneer's distaste subsided. \"What kind of creatures are they?\"\n\n\n \"I have a description, though I've never seen one. It's a small  four-legged animal with two antennae at the lower base of its skull. A  typical pest.\"\n\n\n Taphetta rustled. \"Have you found out how it got on?\"\n\n\n \"It was probably brought in with the supplies,\" said the biologist.  \"Considering how far we've come, it may have been any one of a half  a dozen planets. Anyway, it hid, and since most of the places it had  access to were near the outer hull, it got an extra dose of hard  radiation, or it may have nested near the atomic engines; both are  possibilities. Either way, it mutated, became a different animal. It's  developed a tolerance for the poisons we spray on plants. Other things  it detects and avoids, even electronic traps.\"\n\n\n \"Then you believe it changed mentally as well as physically, that it's  smarter?\"\n\n\n \"I'd say that, yes. It must be a fairly intelligent creature to be  so hard to get rid of. But it can be lured into traps, if the bait's  strong enough.\"\n\n\n \"That's what I don't like,\" said Taphetta, curling. \"Let me think it  over while I ask questions.\" He turned to Emmer. \"I'm curious about  humans. Is there anything else you can tell me about the hypothetical  ancestor?\"\n\n\n Emmer didn't look like the genius he was\u2014a Neanderthal genius, but  nonetheless a real one. In his field, he rated very high. He raised a  stubble-flecked cheek from a large thick-fingered paw and ran shaggy  hands through shaggier hair.\n\n\n \"I can speak with some authority,\" he rumbled. \"I was born on a world  with the most extensive relics. As a child, I played in the ruins of  their camp.\"\n\n\n \"I don't question your authority,\" crinkled Taphetta. \"To me, all  humans\u2014late or early and male or female\u2014look remarkably alike. If you  are an archeologist, that's enough for me.\" He paused and flicked his  speech ribbons. \"Camp, did you say?\" Emmer smiled, unsheathing great teeth. \"You've never seen any pictures?  Impressive, but just a camp, monolithic one-story structures, and  we'd give something to know what they're made of. Presumably my world  was one of the first they stopped at. They weren't used to roughing  it, so they built more elaborately than they did later on. One-story  structures and that's how we can guess at their size. The doorways were  forty feet high.\"\n\n\n \"Very large,\" agreed Taphetta. It was difficult to tell whether he was  impressed. \"What did you find in the ruins?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing,\" said Emmer. \"There were buildings there and that was all,  not a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture. They covered  a route estimated at thirty thousand light-years in less than five  thousand years\u2014and not one of them died that we have a record of.\"\n\n\n \"A faster-than-light drive and an extremely long life,\" mused Taphetta.  \"But they didn't leave any information for their descendants. Why?\"\n\n\n \"Who knows? Their mental processes were certainly far different from  ours. They may have thought we'd be better off without it. We do know  they were looking for a special kind of planet, like Earth, because  they visited so many of that type, yet different from it because they  never stayed. They were pretty special people themselves, big and  long-lived, and maybe they couldn't survive on any planet they found.  Perhaps they had ways of determining there wasn't the kind of planet  they needed in the entire Milky Way. Their science was tremendously  advanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germ  plasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of us  did.\"\n\n\n \"This special planet sounds strange,\" murmured Taphetta.\n\n\n \"Not really,\" said Emmer. \"Fifty human races reached space travel  independently and those who did were scattered equally among early and  late species. It's well known that individuals among my people are  often as bright as any of Halden's or Meredith's, but as a whole we  don't have the total capacity that later Man does, and yet we're as  advanced in civilization. The difference? It must lie somewhere in the  planets we live on and it's hard to say just what it is.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to those who didn't develop space travel?\" asked  Taphetta.\n\n\n \"We helped them,\" said Emmer.\n\n\n And they had, no matter who or what they were, biologically late  or early, in the depths of the bronze age or the threshold of  atomic\u2014because they were human. That was sometimes a frightening thing  for non-humans, that the race stuck together. They weren't actually  aggressive, but their total number was great and they held themselves  aloof. The unknown ancestor again. Who else had such an origin and, it  was tacitly assumed, such a destiny? Taphetta changed his questioning. \"What do you expect to gain from this  discovery of the unknown ancestor?\"\n\n\n It was Halden who answered him. \"There's the satisfaction of knowing  where we came from.\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" rustled the Ribboneer. \"But a lot of money and equipment  was required for this expedition. I can't believe that the educational  institutions that are backing you did so purely out of intellectual  curiosity.\"\n\n\n \"Cultural discoveries,\" rumbled Emmer. \"How did our ancestors live?  When a creature is greatly reduced in size, as we are, more than  physiology is changed\u2014the pattern of life itself is altered. Things  that were easy for them are impossible for us. Look at their life span.\"\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" said Taphetta. \"An archeologist would be interested in  cultural discoveries.\"\n\n\n \"Two hundred thousand years ago, they had an extremely advanced  civilization,\" added Halden. \"A faster-than-light drive, and we've  achieved that only within the last thousand years.\"\n\n\n \"But I think we have a better one than they did,\" said the Ribboneer.  \"There may be things we can learn from them in mechanics or physics,  but wouldn't you say they were better biologists than anything else?\"\n\n\n Halden nodded. \"Agreed. They couldn't find a suitable planet. So,  working directly with their germ plasm, they modified themselves and  produced us. They were master biologists.\"\n\n\n \"I thought so,\" said Taphetta. \"I never paid much attention to your  fantastic theories before I signed to pilot this ship, but you've built  up a convincing case.\" He raised his head, speech ribbons curling  fractionally and ceaselessly. \"I don't like to, but we'll have to risk  using bait for your pest.\"\n\n\n He'd have done it anyway, but it was better to have the pilot's  consent. And there was one question Halden wanted to ask; it had been  bothering him vaguely. \"What's the difference between the Ribboneer  contract and the one we offered you? Our terms are more liberal.\"\n\n\n \"To the individual, they are, but it won't matter if you discover as  much as you think you will. The difference is this: My terms don't  permit you to withhold any discovery for the benefit of one race.\"\n\n\n Taphetta was wrong; there had been no intention of withholding  anything. Halden examined his own attitudes. He hadn't intended, but  could he say that was true of the institutions backing the expedition?  He couldn't, and it was too late now\u2014whatever knowledge they acquired  would have to be shared.\n\n\n That was what Taphetta had been afraid of\u2014there was one kind of  technical advancement that multiplied unceasingly. The race that could  improve itself through scientific control of its germ plasm had a start  that could never be headed. The Ribboneer needn't worry now. \"Why do we have to watch it on the screen?\" asked Meredith, glancing  up. \"I'd rather be in hydroponics.\"\n\n\n Halden shrugged. \"They may or may not be smarter than planetbound  animals, but they're warier. They don't come out when anyone's near.\"\n\n\n Lights dimmed in the distant hydroponic section and the screen with  it, until he adjusted the infra-red frequencies. He motioned to the  two crew members, each with his own peculiar screen, below which was a  miniature keyboard.\n\n\n \"Ready?\"\n\n\n When they nodded, Halden said: \"Do as you've rehearsed. Keep noise at  a minimum, but when you do use it, be vague. Don't try to imitate them  exactly.\"\n\n\n At first, nothing happened on the big screen, and then a gray shape  crept out. It slid through leaves, listened intently before coming  forward. It jumped off one hydroponic section and fled across the open  floor to the next. It paused, eyes glittering and antennae twitching.\n\n\n Looking around once, it leaped up, seizing the ledge and clawing up the  side of the tank. Standing on top and rising to its haunches, it began  nibbling what it could reach.\n\n\n Suddenly it whirled. Behind it and hitherto unnoticed was another  shape, like it but larger. The newcomer inched forward. The small one  retreated, skittering nervously. Without warning, the big one leaped  and the small one tried to flee. In a few jumps, the big one caught up  and mauled the other unmercifully. It continued to bite even after the little one lay still. At last it  backed off and waited, watching for signs of motion. There was none.  Then it turned to the plant. When it had chewed off everything within  reach, it climbed into the branches.\n\n\n The little one twitched, moved a leg, and cautiously began dragging  itself away. It rolled off the raised section and surprisingly made no  noise as it fell. It seemed to revive, shaking itself and scurrying  away, still within range of the screen.\n\n\n Against the wall was a small platform. The little one climbed on top  and there found something that seemed to interest it. It sniffed  around and reached and felt the discovery. Wounds were forgotten as  it snatched up the object and frisked back to the scene of its recent  defeat.\n\n\n This time it had no trouble with the raised section. It leaped and  landed on top and made considerable noise in doing so. The big animal  heard and twisted around. It saw and clambered down hastily, jumping  the last few feet. Squealing, it hit the floor and charged.\n\n\n The small one stood still till the last instant\u2014and then a paw  flickered out and an inch-long knife blade plunged into the throat of  the charging creature. Red spurted out as the bigger beast screamed.  The knife flashed in and out until the big animal collapsed and stopped  moving.\n\n\n The small creature removed the knife and wiped it on the pelt of its  foe. Then it scampered back to the platform on which the knife had been  found\u2014 and laid it down . At Halden's signal, the lights flared up and the screen became too  bright for anything to be visible.\n\n\n \"Go in and get them,\" said Halden. \"We don't want the pests to find out  that the bodies aren't flesh.\"\n\n\n \"It was realistic enough,\" said Meredith as the crewmen shut off their  machines and went out. \"Do you think it will work?\"\n\n\n \"It might. We had an audience.\"\n\n\n \"Did we? I didn't notice.\" Meredith leaned back. \"Were the puppets  exactly like the pests? And if not, will the pests be fooled?\"\n\n\n \"The electronic puppets were a good imitation, but the animals don't  have to identify them as their species. If they're smart enough,  they'll know the value of a knife, no matter who uses it.\"\n\n\n \"What if they're smarter? Suppose they know a knife can't be used by a  creature without real hands?\"\n\n\n \"That's part of our precautions. They'll never know until they try\u2014and  they'll never get away from the trap to try.\"\n\n\n \"Very good. I never thought of that,\" said Meredith, coming closer. \"I  like the way your primitive mind works. At times I actually think of  marrying you.\"\n\n\n \"Primitive,\" he said, alternately frozen and thawed, though he knew  that, in relation to her, he was not advanced.\n\n\n \"It's almost a curse, isn't it?\" She laughed and took the curse away by  leaning provocatively against him. \"But barbaric lovers are often nice.\"\n\n\n Here we go again, he thought drearily, sliding his arm around her. To  her, I'm merely a passionate savage.\n\n\n They went to his cabin.\n\n\n She sat down, smiling. Was she pretty? Maybe. For her own race, she  wasn't tall, only by Terran standards. Her legs were disproportionately  long and well shaped and her face was somewhat bland and featureless,  except for a thin, straight, short nose. It was her eyes that made  the difference, he decided. A notch or two up the scale of visual  development, her eyes were larger and she could see an extra color on  the violet end of the spectrum.\n\n\n She settled back and looked at him. \"It might be fun living with you on  primeval Earth.\"\n\n\n He said nothing; she knew as well as he that Earth was as advanced as  her own world. She had something else in mind.\n\n\n \"I don't think I will, though. We might have children.\"\n\n\n \"Would it be wrong?\" he asked. \"I'm as intelligent as you. We wouldn't  have subhuman monsters.\"\n\n\n \"It would be a step up\u2014for you.\" Under her calm, there was tension.  It had been there as long as he'd known her, but it was closer to the  surface now. \"Do I have the right to condemn the unborn? Should I make  them start lower than I am?\"\n\n\n The conflict was not new nor confined to them. In one form or another,  it governed personal relations between races that were united against  non-humans, but held sharp distinctions themselves.\n\n\n \"I haven't asked you to marry me,\" he said bluntly.\n\n\n \"Because you're afraid I'd refuse.\"\n\n\n It was true; no one asked a member of a higher race to enter a  permanent union.\n\n\n \"Why did you ever have anything to do with me?\" demanded Halden.\n\n\n \"Love,\" she said gloomily. \"Physical attraction. But I can't let it  lead me astray.\"\n\n\n \"Why not make a play for Kelburn? If you're going to be scientific  about it, he'd give you children of the higher type.\"\n\n\n \"Kelburn.\" It didn't sound like a name, the way she said it. \"I don't  like him and he wouldn't marry me.\"\n\n\n \"He wouldn't, but he'd give you children if you were humble enough.  There's a fifty per cent chance you might conceive.\" She provocatively arched her back. Not even the women of Kelburn's race  had a body like hers and she knew it.\n\n\n \"Racially, there should be a chance,\" she said. \"Actually, Kelburn and  I would be infertile.\"\n\n\n \"Can you be sure?\" he asked, knowing it was a poor attempt to act  unconcerned.\n\n\n \"How can anyone be sure on a theoretical basis?\" she asked, an oblique  smile narrowing her eyes. \"I know we can't.\"\n\n\n His face felt anesthetized. \"Did you have to tell me that?\"\n\n\n She got up and came to him. She nuzzled against him and his reaction  was purely reflexive. His hand swung out and he could feel the flesh  give when his knuckles struck it.\n\n\n She fell back and dazedly covered her face with her hand. When she took  it away, blood spurted. She groped toward the mirror and stood in front  of it. She wiped the blood off, examining her features carefully.\n\n\n \"You've broken my nose,\" she said factually. \"I'll have to stop the  blood and pain.\"\n\n\n She pushed her nose back into place and waggled it to make sure. She  closed her eyes and stood silent and motionless. Then she stepped back  and looked at herself critically.\n\n\n \"It's set and partially knitted. I'll concentrate tonight and have it  healed by morning.\"\n\n\n She felt in the cabinet and attached an invisible strip firmly across  the bridge. Then she came over to him.\n\n\n \"I wondered what you'd do. You didn't disappoint me.\"\n\n\n He scowled miserably at her. Her face was almost plain and the bandage,  invisible or not, didn't improve her appearance any. How could he still  feel that attraction to her?\n\n\n \"Try Emmer,\" he suggested tiredly. \"He'll find you irresistible, and  he's even more savage than I am.\"\n\n\n \"Is he?\" She smiled enigmatically. \"Maybe, in a biological sense. Too  much, though. You're just right.\"\n\n\n He sat down on the bed. Again there was only one way of knowing what  Emmer would do\u2014and she knew. She had no concept of love outside of  the physical, to make use of her body so as to gain an advantage\u2014what  advantage?\u2014for the children she intended to have. Outside of that,  nothing mattered, and for the sake of alloying the lower with the  higher, she was as cruel to herself as she was to him. And yet he  wanted her.\n\n\n \"I do think I love you,\" she said. \"And if love's enough, I may marry  you in spite of everything. But you'll have to watch out whose children  I have.\" She wriggled into his arms.\n\n\n The racial disparity was great and she had provoked him, but it was not  completely her fault. Besides....\n\n\n Besides what? She had a beautiful body that could bear superior  children\u2014and they might be his.\n\n\n He twisted away. With those thoughts, he was as bad as she was. Were  they all that way, every one of them, crawling upward out of the slime  toward the highest goal they could conceive of? Climbing over\u2014no, through \u2014everybody they could coerce, seduce or marry\u2014onward and  upward. He raised his hand, but it was against himself that his anger  was turned.\n\n\n \"Careful of the nose,\" she said, pressing against him. \"You've already  broken it once.\"\n\n\n He kissed her with sudden passion that even he knew was primitive. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is NOT true of the crew?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are all different species\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They could all mate with each other (it was explicitly discussed as a possibility in the story)\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They could all mate with each other (it was explicitly discussed as a possibility in the story)\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They could all mate with each other (it was explicitly discussed as a possibility in the story)\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

L. WALLACE\n\n\n Illustrated by EMSH\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction November 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Man's family tree was awesome enough to give every galactic   race an inferiority complex\u2014but then he tried to climb it! In repose, Taphetta the Ribboneer resembled a fancy giant bow on a  package. His four flat legs looped out and in, the ends tucked under  his wide, thin body, which constituted the knot at the middle. His neck  was flat, too, arching out in another loop. Of all his features, only  his head had appreciable thickness and it was crowned with a dozen long  though narrower ribbons.\n\n\n Taphetta rattled the head fronds together in a surprisingly good  imitation of speech. \"Yes, I've heard the legend.\"\n\n\n \"It's more than a legend,\" said Sam Halden, biologist. The reaction was  not unexpected\u2014non-humans tended to dismiss the data as convenient  speculation and nothing more. \"There are at least a hundred kinds of  humans, each supposedly originating in strict seclusion on as many  widely scattered planets. Obviously there was no contact throughout the  ages before space travel\u2014 and yet each planetary race can interbreed  with a minimum of ten others ! That's more than a legend\u2014one hell of a  lot more!\"\n\n\n \"It is impressive,\" admitted Taphetta. \"But I find it mildly  distasteful to consider mating with someone who does not belong to my  species.\"\n\n\n \"That's because you're unique,\" said Halden. \"Outside of your own  world, there's nothing like your species, except superficially, and  that's true of all other creatures, intelligent or not, with the sole  exception of mankind. Actually, the four of us here, though it's  accidental, very nearly represent the biological spectrum of human  development. \"Emmer, a Neanderthal type and our archeologist, is around the  beginning of the scale. I'm from Earth, near the middle, though on  Emmer's side. Meredith, linguist, is on the other side of the middle.  And beyond her, toward the far end, is Kelburn, mathematician. There's  a corresponding span of fertility. Emmer just misses being able to  breed with my kind, but there's a fair chance that I'd be fertile with  Meredith and a similar though lesser chance that her fertility may  extend to Kelburn.\" Taphetta rustled his speech ribbons quizzically. \"But I thought it was  proved that some humans did originate on one planet, that there was an  unbroken line of evolution that could be traced back a billion years.\"\n\n\n \"You're thinking of Earth,\" said Halden. \"Humans require a certain kind  of planet. It's reasonable to assume that, if men were set down on a  hundred such worlds, they'd seem to fit in with native life-forms on a  few of them. That's what happened on Earth; when Man arrived, there was  actually a manlike creature there. Naturally our early evolutionists  stretched their theories to cover the facts they had.\n\n\n \"But there are other worlds in which humans who were there before the  Stone Age aren't related to anything else there. We have to conclude  that Man didn't originate on any of the planets on which he is now  found. Instead, he evolved elsewhere and later was scattered throughout  this section of the Milky Way.\"\n\n\n \"And so, to account for the unique race that can interbreed across  thousands of light-years, you've brought in the big ancestor,\"  commented Taphetta dryly. \"It seems an unnecessary simplification.\"\n\n\n \"Can you think of a better explanation?\" asked Kelburn.\n\n\n \"Something had to distribute one species so widely and it's not the  result of parallel evolution\u2014not when a hundred human races are  involved, and only the human race.\"\n\n\n \"I can't think of a better explanation.\" Taphetta rearranged his  ribbons. \"Frankly, no one else is much interested in Man's theories  about himself.\"\n\n\n It was easy to understand the attitude. Man was the most numerous  though not always the most advanced\u2014Ribboneers had a civilization as  high as anything in the known section of the Milky Way, and there were  others\u2014and humans were more than a little feared. If they ever got  together\u2014but they hadn't except in agreement as to their common origin.\n\n\n Still, Taphetta the Ribboneer was an experienced pilot and could be  very useful. A clear statement of their position was essential in  helping him make up his mind. \"You've heard of the adjacency mating  principle?\" asked Sam Halden.\n\n\n \"Vaguely. Most people have if they've been around men.\"\n\n\n \"We've got new data and are able to interpret it better. The theory is  that humans who can mate with each other were once physically close.  We've got a list of all our races arranged in sequence. If planetary  race F can mate with race E back to A and forward to M, and race G is  fertile only back to B, but forward to O, then we assume that whatever  their positions are now, at once time G was actually adjacent to F, but  was a little further along. When we project back into time those star  systems on which humans existed prior to space travel, we get a certain  pattern. Kelburn can explain it to you.\"\n\n\n The normally pink body of the Ribboneer flushed slightly. The color  change was almost imperceptible, but it was enough to indicate that he  was interested. Kelburn went to the projector. \"It would be easier if we knew all the  stars in the Milky Way, but though we've explored only a small portion  of it, we can reconstruct a fairly accurate representation of the past.\"\n\n\n He pressed the controls and stars twinkled on the screen. \"We're  looking down on the plane of the Galaxy. This is one arm of it as it is  today and here are the human systems.\" He pressed another control and,  for purposes of identification, certain stars became more brilliant.  There was no pattern, merely a scattering of stars. \"The whole Milky  Way is rotating. And while stars in a given region tend to remain  together, there's also a random motion. Here's what happens when we  calculate the positions of stars in the past.\"\n\n\n Flecks of light shifted and flowed across the screen. Kelburn stopped  the motion.\n\n\n \"Two hundred thousand years ago,\" he said.\n\n\n There was a pattern of the identified stars. They were spaced at fairly  equal intervals along a regular curve, a horseshoe loop that didn't  close, though if the ends were extended, the lines would have crossed.\n\n\n Taphetta rustled. \"The math is accurate?\"\n\n\n \"As accurate as it can be with a million-plus body problem.\"\n\n\n \"And that's the hypothetical route of the unknown ancestor?\"\n\n\n \"To the best of our knowledge,\" said Kelburn. \"And whereas there are  humans who are relatively near and not fertile, they can always mate  with those they were adjacent to two hundred thousand years ago !\"\n\n\n \"The adjacency mating principle. I've never seen it demonstrated,\"  murmured Taphetta, flexing his ribbons. \"Is that the only era that  satisfies the calculations?\"\n\n\n \"Plus or minus a hundred thousand years, we can still get something  that might be the path of a spaceship attempting to cover a  representative section of territory,\" said Kelburn. \"However, we have  other ways of dating it. On some worlds on which there are no other  mammals, we're able to place the first human fossils chronologically.  The evidence is sometimes contradictory, but we believe we've got the  time right.\"\n\n\n Taphetta waved a ribbon at the chart. \"And you think that where the two  ends of the curve cross is your original home?\"\n\n\n \"We think so,\" said Kelburn. \"We've narrowed it down to several cubic  light-years\u2014then. Now it's far more. And, of course, if it were a  fast-moving star, it might be completely out of the field of our  exploration. But we're certain we've got a good chance of finding it  this trip.\"\n\n\n \"It seems I must decide quickly.\" The Ribboneer glanced out the  visionport, where another ship hung motionless in space beside them.  \"Do you mind if I ask other questions?\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead,\" Kelburn invited sardonically. \"But if it's not math, you'd  better ask Halden. He's the leader of the expedition.\"\n\n\n Halden flushed; the sarcasm wasn't necessary. It was true that Kelburn  was the most advanced human type present, but while there were  differences, biological and in the scale of intelligence, it wasn't  as great as once was thought. Anyway, non-humans weren't trained in  the fine distinctions that men made among themselves. And, higher or  lower, he was as good a biologist as the other was a mathematician. And  there was the matter of training; he'd been on several expeditions and  this was Kelburn's first trip. Damn it, he thought, that rated some  respect.\n\n\n The Ribboneer shifted his attention. \"Aside from the sudden illness of  your pilot, why did you ask for me?\"\n\n\n \"We didn't. The man became sick and required treatment we can't give  him. Luckily, a ship was passing and we hailed it because it's four  months to the nearest planet. They consented to take him back and told  us that there was a passenger on board who was an experienced pilot. We  have men who could do the job in a makeshift fashion, but the region  we're heading for, while mapped, is largely unknown. We'd prefer to  have an expert\u2014and Ribboneers are famous for their navigational  ability.\"\n\n\n Taphetta crinkled politely at the reference to his skill. \"I had other  plans, but I can't evade professional obligations, and an emergency  such as this should cancel out any previous agreements. Still, what are  the incentives?\"\n\n\n Sam Halden coughed. \"The usual, plus a little extra. We've copied the  Ribboneer's standard nature, simplifying it a little and adding a per  cent here and there for the crew pilot and scientist's share of the  profits from any discoveries we may make.\"\n\n\n \"I'm complimented that you like our contract so well,\" said Taphetta,  \"but I really must have our own unsimplified version. If you want me,  you'll take my contract. I came prepared.\" He extended a tightly bound  roll that he had kept somewhere on his person.\n\n\n They glanced at one another as Halden took it.\n\n\n \"You can read it if you want,\" offered Taphetta. \"But it will take  you all day\u2014it's micro-printing. However, you needn't be afraid that  I'm defrauding you. It's honored everywhere we go and we go nearly  everywhere in this sector\u2014places men have never been.\"\n\n\n There was no choice if they wanted him, and they did. Besides, the  integrity of Ribboneers was not to be questioned. Halden signed.\n\n\n \"Good.\" Taphetta crinkled. \"Send it to the ship; they'll forward it  for me. And you can tell the ship to go on without me.\" He rubbed his  ribbons together. \"Now if you'll get me the charts, I'll examine the  region toward which we're heading.\" Firmon of hydroponics slouched in, a tall man with scanty hair and  an equal lack of grace. He seemed to have difficulty in taking his  eyes off Meredith, though, since he was a notch or so above her in the  mating scale, he shouldn't have been so interested. But his planet had  been inexplicably slow in developing and he wasn't completely aware of  his place in the human hierarchy.\n\n\n Disdainfully, Meredith adjusted a skirt that, a few inches shorter,  wouldn't have been a skirt at all, revealing, while doing so, just how  long and beautiful a woman's legs could be. Her people had never given  much thought to physical modesty and, with legs like that, it was easy  to see why.\n\n\n Muttering something about primitive women, Firmon turned to the  biologist. \"The pilot doesn't like our air.\"\n\n\n \"Then change it to suit him. He's in charge of the ship and knows more  about these things than I do.\"\n\n\n \"More than a man?\" Firmon leered at Meredith and, when she failed  to smile, added plaintively, \"I did try to change it, but he still  complains.\" Halden took a deep breath. \"Seems all right to me.\"\n\n\n \"To everybody else, too, but the tapeworm hasn't got lungs. He breathes  through a million tubes scattered over his body.\"\n\n\n It would do no good to explain that Taphetta wasn't a worm, that his  evolution had taken a different course, but that he was in no sense  less complex than Man. It was a paradox that some biologically higher  humans hadn't developed as much as lower races and actually weren't  prepared for the multitude of life-forms they'd meet in space. Firmon's  reaction was quite typical.\n\n\n \"If he asks for cleaner air, it's because his system needs it,\" said  Halden. \"Do anything you can to give it to him.\"\n\n\n \"Can't. This is as good as I can get it. Taphetta thought you could do  something about it.\"\n\n\n \"Hydroponics is your job. There's nothing I can do.\" Halden paused  thoughtfully. \"Is there something wrong with the plants?\"\n\n\n \"In a way, I guess, and yet not really.\"\n\n\n \"What is it, some kind of toxic condition?\"\n\n\n \"The plants are healthy enough, but something's chewing them down as  fast as they grow.\"\n\n\n \"Insects? There shouldn't be any, but if there are, we've got sprays.  Use them.\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal,\" said Firmon. \"We tried poison and got a few, but now  they won't touch the stuff. I had electronics rig up some traps. The  animals seem to know what they are and we've never caught one that  way.\"\n\n\n Halden glowered at the man. \"How long has this been going on?\"\n\n\n \"About three months. It's not bad; we can keep up with them.\"\n\n\n It was probably nothing to become alarmed at, but an animal on the ship  was a nuisance, doubly so because of their pilot.\n\n\n \"Tell me what you know about it,\" said Halden.\n\n\n \"They're little things.\" Firmon held out his hands to show how small.  \"I don't know how they got on, but once they did, there were plenty of  places to hide.\" He looked up defensively. \"This is an old ship with  new equipment and they hide under the machinery. There's nothing we can  do except rebuild the ship from the hull inward.\"\n\n\n Firmon was right. The new equipment had been installed in any place  just to get it in and now there were inaccessible corners and crevices  everywhere that couldn't be closed off without rebuilding.\n\n\n They couldn't set up a continuous watch and shoot the animals down  because there weren't that many men to spare. Besides, the use of  weapons in hydroponics would cause more damage to the thing they were  trying to protect than to the pest. He'd have to devise other ways.\n\n\n Sam Halden got up. \"I'll take a look and see what I can do.\"\n\n\n \"I'll come along and help,\" said Meredith, untwining her legs and  leaning against him. \"Your mistress ought to have some sort of  privileges.\"\n\n\n Halden started. So she knew that the crew was calling her that!  Perhaps it was intended to discourage Firmon, but he wished she hadn't  said it. It didn't help the situation at all. Taphetta sat in a chair designed for humans. With a less flexible body,  he wouldn't have fitted. Maybe it wasn't sitting, but his flat legs  were folded neatly around the arms and his head rested comfortably on  the seat. The head ribbons, which were his hands and voice, were never  quite still.\n\n\n He looked from Halden to Emmer and back again. \"The hydroponics tech  tells me you're contemplating an experiment. I don't like it.\"\n\n\n Halden shrugged. \"We've got to have better air. It might work.\"\n\n\n \"Pests on the ship? It's filthy! My people would never tolerate it!\"\n\n\n \"Neither do we.\"\n\n\n The Ribboneer's distaste subsided. \"What kind of creatures are they?\"\n\n\n \"I have a description, though I've never seen one. It's a small  four-legged animal with two antennae at the lower base of its skull. A  typical pest.\"\n\n\n Taphetta rustled. \"Have you found out how it got on?\"\n\n\n \"It was probably brought in with the supplies,\" said the biologist.  \"Considering how far we've come, it may have been any one of a half  a dozen planets. Anyway, it hid, and since most of the places it had  access to were near the outer hull, it got an extra dose of hard  radiation, or it may have nested near the atomic engines; both are  possibilities. Either way, it mutated, became a different animal. It's  developed a tolerance for the poisons we spray on plants. Other things  it detects and avoids, even electronic traps.\"\n\n\n \"Then you believe it changed mentally as well as physically, that it's  smarter?\"\n\n\n \"I'd say that, yes. It must be a fairly intelligent creature to be  so hard to get rid of. But it can be lured into traps, if the bait's  strong enough.\"\n\n\n \"That's what I don't like,\" said Taphetta, curling. \"Let me think it  over while I ask questions.\" He turned to Emmer. \"I'm curious about  humans. Is there anything else you can tell me about the hypothetical  ancestor?\"\n\n\n Emmer didn't look like the genius he was\u2014a Neanderthal genius, but  nonetheless a real one. In his field, he rated very high. He raised a  stubble-flecked cheek from a large thick-fingered paw and ran shaggy  hands through shaggier hair.\n\n\n \"I can speak with some authority,\" he rumbled. \"I was born on a world  with the most extensive relics. As a child, I played in the ruins of  their camp.\"\n\n\n \"I don't question your authority,\" crinkled Taphetta. \"To me, all  humans\u2014late or early and male or female\u2014look remarkably alike. If you  are an archeologist, that's enough for me.\" He paused and flicked his  speech ribbons. \"Camp, did you say?\" Emmer smiled, unsheathing great teeth. \"You've never seen any pictures?  Impressive, but just a camp, monolithic one-story structures, and  we'd give something to know what they're made of. Presumably my world  was one of the first they stopped at. They weren't used to roughing  it, so they built more elaborately than they did later on. One-story  structures and that's how we can guess at their size. The doorways were  forty feet high.\"\n\n\n \"Very large,\" agreed Taphetta. It was difficult to tell whether he was  impressed. \"What did you find in the ruins?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing,\" said Emmer. \"There were buildings there and that was all,  not a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture. They covered  a route estimated at thirty thousand light-years in less than five  thousand years\u2014and not one of them died that we have a record of.\"\n\n\n \"A faster-than-light drive and an extremely long life,\" mused Taphetta.  \"But they didn't leave any information for their descendants. Why?\"\n\n\n \"Who knows? Their mental processes were certainly far different from  ours. They may have thought we'd be better off without it. We do know  they were looking for a special kind of planet, like Earth, because  they visited so many of that type, yet different from it because they  never stayed. They were pretty special people themselves, big and  long-lived, and maybe they couldn't survive on any planet they found.  Perhaps they had ways of determining there wasn't the kind of planet  they needed in the entire Milky Way. Their science was tremendously  advanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germ  plasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of us  did.\"\n\n\n \"This special planet sounds strange,\" murmured Taphetta.\n\n\n \"Not really,\" said Emmer. \"Fifty human races reached space travel  independently and those who did were scattered equally among early and  late species. It's well known that individuals among my people are  often as bright as any of Halden's or Meredith's, but as a whole we  don't have the total capacity that later Man does, and yet we're as  advanced in civilization. The difference? It must lie somewhere in the  planets we live on and it's hard to say just what it is.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to those who didn't develop space travel?\" asked  Taphetta.\n\n\n \"We helped them,\" said Emmer.\n\n\n And they had, no matter who or what they were, biologically late  or early, in the depths of the bronze age or the threshold of  atomic\u2014because they were human. That was sometimes a frightening thing  for non-humans, that the race stuck together. They weren't actually  aggressive, but their total number was great and they held themselves  aloof. The unknown ancestor again. Who else had such an origin and, it  was tacitly assumed, such a destiny? Taphetta changed his questioning. \"What do you expect to gain from this  discovery of the unknown ancestor?\"\n\n\n It was Halden who answered him. \"There's the satisfaction of knowing  where we came from.\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" rustled the Ribboneer. \"But a lot of money and equipment  was required for this expedition. I can't believe that the educational  institutions that are backing you did so purely out of intellectual  curiosity.\"\n\n\n \"Cultural discoveries,\" rumbled Emmer. \"How did our ancestors live?  When a creature is greatly reduced in size, as we are, more than  physiology is changed\u2014the pattern of life itself is altered. Things  that were easy for them are impossible for us. Look at their life span.\"\n\n\n \"No doubt,\" said Taphetta. \"An archeologist would be interested in  cultural discoveries.\"\n\n\n \"Two hundred thousand years ago, they had an extremely advanced  civilization,\" added Halden. \"A faster-than-light drive, and we've  achieved that only within the last thousand years.\"\n\n\n \"But I think we have a better one than they did,\" said the Ribboneer.  \"There may be things we can learn from them in mechanics or physics,  but wouldn't you say they were better biologists than anything else?\"\n\n\n Halden nodded. \"Agreed. They couldn't find a suitable planet. So,  working directly with their germ plasm, they modified themselves and  produced us. They were master biologists.\"\n\n\n \"I thought so,\" said Taphetta. \"I never paid much attention to your  fantastic theories before I signed to pilot this ship, but you've built  up a convincing case.\" He raised his head, speech ribbons curling  fractionally and ceaselessly. \"I don't like to, but we'll have to risk  using bait for your pest.\"\n\n\n He'd have done it anyway, but it was better to have the pilot's  consent. And there was one question Halden wanted to ask; it had been  bothering him vaguely. \"What's the difference between the Ribboneer  contract and the one we offered you? Our terms are more liberal.\"\n\n\n \"To the individual, they are, but it won't matter if you discover as  much as you think you will. The difference is this: My terms don't  permit you to withhold any discovery for the benefit of one race.\"\n\n\n Taphetta was wrong; there had been no intention of withholding  anything. Halden examined his own attitudes. He hadn't intended, but  could he say that was true of the institutions backing the expedition?  He couldn't, and it was too late now\u2014whatever knowledge they acquired  would have to be shared.\n\n\n That was what Taphetta had been afraid of\u2014there was one kind of  technical advancement that multiplied unceasingly. The race that could  improve itself through scientific control of its germ plasm had a start  that could never be headed. The Ribboneer needn't worry now. \"Why do we have to watch it on the screen?\" asked Meredith, glancing  up. \"I'd rather be in hydroponics.\"\n\n\n Halden shrugged. \"They may or may not be smarter than planetbound  animals, but they're warier. They don't come out when anyone's near.\"\n\n\n Lights dimmed in the distant hydroponic section and the screen with  it, until he adjusted the infra-red frequencies. He motioned to the  two crew members, each with his own peculiar screen, below which was a  miniature keyboard.\n\n\n \"Ready?\"\n\n\n When they nodded, Halden said: \"Do as you've rehearsed. Keep noise at  a minimum, but when you do use it, be vague. Don't try to imitate them  exactly.\"\n\n\n At first, nothing happened on the big screen, and then a gray shape  crept out. It slid through leaves, listened intently before coming  forward. It jumped off one hydroponic section and fled across the open  floor to the next. It paused, eyes glittering and antennae twitching.\n\n\n Looking around once, it leaped up, seizing the ledge and clawing up the  side of the tank. Standing on top and rising to its haunches, it began  nibbling what it could reach.\n\n\n Suddenly it whirled. Behind it and hitherto unnoticed was another  shape, like it but larger. The newcomer inched forward. The small one  retreated, skittering nervously. Without warning, the big one leaped  and the small one tried to flee. In a few jumps, the big one caught up  and mauled the other unmercifully. It continued to bite even after the little one lay still. At last it  backed off and waited, watching for signs of motion. There was none.  Then it turned to the plant. When it had chewed off everything within  reach, it climbed into the branches.\n\n\n The little one twitched, moved a leg, and cautiously began dragging  itself away. It rolled off the raised section and surprisingly made no  noise as it fell. It seemed to revive, shaking itself and scurrying  away, still within range of the screen.\n\n\n Against the wall was a small platform. The little one climbed on top  and there found something that seemed to interest it. It sniffed  around and reached and felt the discovery. Wounds were forgotten as  it snatched up the object and frisked back to the scene of its recent  defeat.\n\n\n This time it had no trouble with the raised section. It leaped and  landed on top and made considerable noise in doing so. The big animal  heard and twisted around. It saw and clambered down hastily, jumping  the last few feet. Squealing, it hit the floor and charged.\n\n\n The small one stood still till the last instant\u2014and then a paw  flickered out and an inch-long knife blade plunged into the throat of  the charging creature. Red spurted out as the bigger beast screamed.  The knife flashed in and out until the big animal collapsed and stopped  moving.\n\n\n The small creature removed the knife and wiped it on the pelt of its  foe. Then it scampered back to the platform on which the knife had been  found\u2014 and laid it down . At Halden's signal, the lights flared up and the screen became too  bright for anything to be visible.\n\n\n \"Go in and get them,\" said Halden. \"We don't want the pests to find out  that the bodies aren't flesh.\"\n\n\n \"It was realistic enough,\" said Meredith as the crewmen shut off their  machines and went out. \"Do you think it will work?\"\n\n\n \"It might. We had an audience.\"\n\n\n \"Did we? I didn't notice.\" Meredith leaned back. \"Were the puppets  exactly like the pests? And if not, will the pests be fooled?\"\n\n\n \"The electronic puppets were a good imitation, but the animals don't  have to identify them as their species. If they're smart enough,  they'll know the value of a knife, no matter who uses it.\"\n\n\n \"What if they're smarter? Suppose they know a knife can't be used by a  creature without real hands?\"\n\n\n \"That's part of our precautions. They'll never know until they try\u2014and  they'll never get away from the trap to try.\"\n\n\n \"Very good. I never thought of that,\" said Meredith, coming closer. \"I  like the way your primitive mind works. At times I actually think of  marrying you.\"\n\n\n \"Primitive,\" he said, alternately frozen and thawed, though he knew  that, in relation to her, he was not advanced.\n\n\n \"It's almost a curse, isn't it?\" She laughed and took the curse away by  leaning provocatively against him. \"But barbaric lovers are often nice.\"\n\n\n Here we go again, he thought drearily, sliding his arm around her. To  her, I'm merely a passionate savage.\n\n\n They went to his cabin.\n\n\n She sat down, smiling. Was she pretty? Maybe. For her own race, she  wasn't tall, only by Terran standards. Her legs were disproportionately  long and well shaped and her face was somewhat bland and featureless,  except for a thin, straight, short nose. It was her eyes that made  the difference, he decided. A notch or two up the scale of visual  development, her eyes were larger and she could see an extra color on  the violet end of the spectrum.\n\n\n She settled back and looked at him. \"It might be fun living with you on  primeval Earth.\"\n\n\n He said nothing; she knew as well as he that Earth was as advanced as  her own world. She had something else in mind.\n\n\n \"I don't think I will, though. We might have children.\"\n\n\n \"Would it be wrong?\" he asked. \"I'm as intelligent as you. We wouldn't  have subhuman monsters.\"\n\n\n \"It would be a step up\u2014for you.\" Under her calm, there was tension.  It had been there as long as he'd known her, but it was closer to the  surface now. \"Do I have the right to condemn the unborn? Should I make  them start lower than I am?\"\n\n\n The conflict was not new nor confined to them. In one form or another,  it governed personal relations between races that were united against  non-humans, but held sharp distinctions themselves.\n\n\n \"I haven't asked you to marry me,\" he said bluntly.\n\n\n \"Because you're afraid I'd refuse.\"\n\n\n It was true; no one asked a member of a higher race to enter a  permanent union.\n\n\n \"Why did you ever have anything to do with me?\" demanded Halden.\n\n\n \"Love,\" she said gloomily. \"Physical attraction. But I can't let it  lead me astray.\"\n\n\n \"Why not make a play for Kelburn? If you're going to be scientific  about it, he'd give you children of the higher type.\"\n\n\n \"Kelburn.\" It didn't sound like a name, the way she said it. \"I don't  like him and he wouldn't marry me.\"\n\n\n \"He wouldn't, but he'd give you children if you were humble enough.  There's a fifty per cent chance you might conceive.\" She provocatively arched her back. Not even the women of Kelburn's race  had a body like hers and she knew it.\n\n\n \"Racially, there should be a chance,\" she said. \"Actually, Kelburn and  I would be infertile.\"\n\n\n \"Can you be sure?\" he asked, knowing it was a poor attempt to act  unconcerned.\n\n\n \"How can anyone be sure on a theoretical basis?\" she asked, an oblique  smile narrowing her eyes. \"I know we can't.\"\n\n\n His face felt anesthetized. \"Did you have to tell me that?\"\n\n\n She got up and came to him. She nuzzled against him and his reaction  was purely reflexive. His hand swung out and he could feel the flesh  give when his knuckles struck it.\n\n\n She fell back and dazedly covered her face with her hand. When she took  it away, blood spurted. She groped toward the mirror and stood in front  of it. She wiped the blood off, examining her features carefully.\n\n\n \"You've broken my nose,\" she said factually. \"I'll have to stop the  blood and pain.\"\n\n\n She pushed her nose back into place and waggled it to make sure. She  closed her eyes and stood silent and motionless. Then she stepped back  and looked at herself critically.\n\n\n \"It's set and partially knitted. I'll concentrate tonight and have it  healed by morning.\"\n\n\n She felt in the cabinet and attached an invisible strip firmly across  the bridge. Then she came over to him.\n\n\n \"I wondered what you'd do. You didn't disappoint me.\"\n\n\n He scowled miserably at her. Her face was almost plain and the bandage,  invisible or not, didn't improve her appearance any. How could he still  feel that attraction to her?\n\n\n \"Try Emmer,\" he suggested tiredly. \"He'll find you irresistible, and  he's even more savage than I am.\"\n\n\n \"Is he?\" She smiled enigmatically. \"Maybe, in a biological sense. Too  much, though. You're just right.\"\n\n\n He sat down on the bed. Again there was only one way of knowing what  Emmer would do\u2014and she knew. She had no concept of love outside of  the physical, to make use of her body so as to gain an advantage\u2014what  advantage?\u2014for the children she intended to have. Outside of that,  nothing mattered, and for the sake of alloying the lower with the  higher, she was as cruel to herself as she was to him. And yet he  wanted her.\n\n\n \"I do think I love you,\" she said. \"And if love's enough, I may marry  you in spite of everything. But you'll have to watch out whose children  I have.\" She wriggled into his arms.\n\n\n The racial disparity was great and she had provoked him, but it was not  completely her fault. Besides....\n\n\n Besides what? She had a beautiful body that could bear superior  children\u2014and they might be his.\n\n\n He twisted away. With those thoughts, he was as bad as she was. Were  they all that way, every one of them, crawling upward out of the slime  toward the highest goal they could conceive of? Climbing over\u2014no, through \u2014everybody they could coerce, seduce or marry\u2014onward and  upward. He raised his hand, but it was against himself that his anger  was turned.\n\n\n \"Careful of the nose,\" she said, pressing against him. \"You've already  broken it once.\"\n\n\n He kissed her with sudden passion that even he knew was primitive. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is NOT true of the crew?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are all different species\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They could all mate with each other (it was explicitly discussed as a possibility in the story)\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They could all mate with each other (it was explicitly discussed as a possibility in the story)\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They could all mate with each other (it was explicitly discussed as a possibility in the story)\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
