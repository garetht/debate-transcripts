The\n\n DELEGATE\n\n FROM\n\n VENUS By HENRY SLESAR ILLUSTRATOR NOVICK Everybody was waiting to see  what the delegate from Venus  looked like. And all they got  for their patience was the  biggest surprise since David  clobbered Goliath. \"  Let  me put it this way,\"  Conners said paternally.  \"We expect a certain amount of  decorum from our Washington  news correspondents, and that's  all I'm asking for.\"\n\n\n Jerry Bridges, sitting in the  chair opposite his employer's  desk, chewed on his knuckles  and said nothing. One part of  his mind wanted him to play it  cagey, to behave the way the  newspaper wanted him to behave,  to protect the cozy Washington  assignment he had waited  four years to get. But another  part of him, a rebel part,  wanted him to stay on the trail  of the story he felt sure was  about to break.\n\n\n \"I didn't mean to make trouble,  Mr. Conners,\" he said casually.  \"It just seemed strange, all  these exchanges of couriers in  the past two days. I couldn't  help thinking something was  up.\"\n\n\n \"Even if that's true, we'll  hear about it through the usual  channels,\" Conners frowned.  \"But getting a senator's secretary  drunk to obtain information\u2014well,  that's not only indiscreet,  Bridges. It's downright  dirty.\"\n\n\n Jerry grinned. \"I didn't take that kind of advantage, Mr.  Conners. Not that she wasn't a  toothsome little dish ...\"\n\n\n \"Just thank your lucky stars  that it didn't go any further.  And from now on\u2014\" He waggled  a finger at him. \"Watch  your step.\"\n\n\n Jerry got up and ambled to the  door. But he turned before leaving  and said:\n\n\n \"By the way. What do you think is going on?\"\n\n\n \"I haven't the faintest idea.\"\n\n\n \"Don't kid me, Mr. Conners.  Think it's war?\"\n\n\n \"That'll be all, Bridges.\" The reporter closed the door  behind him, and then strolled  out of the building into the sunlight.\n\n\n He met Ruskin, the fat little  AP correspondent, in front of  the Pan-American Building on  Constitution Avenue. Ruskin  was holding the newspaper that  contained the gossip-column  item which had started the  whole affair, and he seemed  more interested in the romantic  rather than political implications.  As he walked beside him,  he said:\n\n\n \"So what really happened,  pal? That Greta babe really let  down her hair?\"\n\n\n \"Where's your decorum?\"  Jerry growled.\n\n\n Ruskin giggled. \"Boy, she's  quite a dame, all right. I think  they ought to get the Secret  Service to guard her. She really  fills out a size 10, don't she?\"\n\n\n \"Ruskin,\" Jerry said, \"you  have a low mind. For a week,  this town has been acting like  the 39 Steps , and all you can  think about is dames. What's  the matter with you? Where  will you be when the big mushroom  cloud comes?\"\n\n\n \"With Greta, I hope,\" Ruskin  sighed. \"What a way to get  radioactive.\"\n\n\n They split off a few blocks  later, and Jerry walked until he  came to the Red Tape Bar &amp;  Grill, a favorite hangout of the  local journalists. There were  three other newsmen at the bar,  and they gave him snickering  greetings. He took a small table  in the rear and ate his meal in  sullen silence.\n\n\n It wasn't the newsmen's jibes  that bothered him; it was the  certainty that something of  major importance was happening  in the capitol. There had  been hourly conferences at the  White House, flying visits by  State Department officials, mysterious  conferences involving  members of the Science Commission.  So far, the byword  had been secrecy. They knew  that Senator Spocker, chairman  of the Congressional Science  Committee, had been involved  in every meeting, but Senator  Spocker was unavailable. His  secretary, however, was a little  more obliging ...\n\n\n Jerry looked up from his  coffee and blinked when he saw  who was coming through the  door of the Bar &amp; Grill. So did  every other patron, but for different  reasons. Greta Johnson  had that effect upon men. Even  the confining effect of a mannishly-tailored  suit didn't hide  her outrageously feminine qualities.\n\n\n She walked straight to his  table, and he stood up.\n\n\n \"They told me you might be  here,\" she said, breathing hard.  \"I just wanted to thank you for  last night.\"\n\n\n \"Look, Greta\u2014\" Wham! Her hand, small and  delicate, felt like a slab of lead  when it slammed into his cheek.  She left a bruise five fingers  wide, and then turned and stalked  out. He ran after her, the restaurant  proprietor shouting about  the unpaid bill. It took a rapid  dog-trot to reach her side.\n\n\n \"Greta, listen!\" he panted.  \"You don't understand about  last night. It wasn't the way  that lousy columnist said\u2014\"\n\n\n She stopped in her tracks.\n\n\n \"I wouldn't have minded so  much if you'd gotten me drunk.  But to use me, just to get a  story\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But I'm a reporter , damn it.  It's my job. I'd do it again if  I thought you knew anything.\"\n\n\n She was pouting now. \"Well,  how do you suppose I feel,  knowing you're only interested  in me because of the Senator?  Anyway, I'll probably lose my  job, and then you won't have any use for me.\"\n\n\n \"Good-bye, Greta,\" Jerry said  sadly.\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"Good-bye. I suppose you  won't want to see me any more.\"\n\n\n \"Did I say that?\"\n\n\n \"It just won't be any use.  We'll always have this thing between  us.\"\n\n\n She looked at him for a moment,  and then touched his  bruised cheek with a tender,  motherly gesture.\n\n\n \"Your poor face,\" she murmured,  and then sighed. \"Oh,  well. I guess there's no use  fighting it. Maybe if I did tell  you what I know, we could act human again.\"\n\n\n \"Greta!\"\n\n\n \"But if you print one word of it, Jerry Bridges, I'll never  speak to you again!\"\n\n\n \"Honey,\" Jerry said, taking  her arm, \"you can trust me like  a brother.\"\n\n\n \"That's not the idea,\" Greta  said stiffly.\n\n\n In a secluded booth at the rear  of a restaurant unfrequented by  newsmen, Greta leaned forward  and said:\n\n\n \"At first, they thought it was  another sputnik.\"\n\n\n \" Who did?\"\n\n\n \"The State Department, silly.  They got reports from the observatories  about another sputnik  being launched by the Russians.  Only the Russians denied  it. Then there were joint meetings,  and nobody could figure  out what the damn thing was.\"\n\n\n \"Wait a minute,\" Jerry said  dizzily. \"You mean to tell me  there's another of those metal  moons up there?\"\n\n\n \"But it's not a moon. That's  the big point. It's a spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"A what ?\"\n\n\n \"A spaceship,\" Greta said  coolly, sipping lemonade. \"They  have been in contact with it now  for about three days, and they're  thinking of calling a plenary  session of the UN just to figure  out what to do about it. The  only hitch is, Russia doesn't  want to wait that long, and is  asking for a hurry-up summit  meeting to make a decision.\"\n\n\n \"A decision about what?\"\n\n\n \"About the Venusians, of  course.\"\n\n\n \"Greta,\" Jerry said mildly, \"I  think you're still a little woozy  from last night.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be silly. The spaceship's  from Venus; they've already  established that. And the  people on it\u2014I guess they're  people\u2014want to know if they  can land their delegate.\"\n\n\n \"Their what?\"\n\n\n \"Their delegate. They came  here for some kind of conference,  I guess. They know about  the UN and everything, and  they want to take part. They  say that with all the satellites  being launched, that our affairs  are their affairs, too. It's kind  of confusing, but that's what  they say.\"\n\n\n \"You mean these Venusians  speak English?\"\n\n\n \"And Russian. And French.  And German. And everything I  guess. They've been having  radio talks with practically  every country for the past three  days. Like I say, they want to  establish diplomatic relations  or something. The Senator  thinks that if we don't agree,  they might do something drastic,  like blow us all up. It's kind  of scary.\" She shivered delicately.\n\n\n \"You're taking it mighty  calm,\" he said ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, how else can I take it?  I'm not even supposed to know about it, except that the Senator  is so careless about\u2014\" She  put her fingers to her lips. \"Oh,  dear, now you'll really think I'm  terrible.\"\n\n\n \"Terrible? I think you're  wonderful!\"\n\n\n \"And you promise not to print  it?\"\n\n\n \"Didn't I say I wouldn't?\"\n\n\n \"Y-e-s. But you know, you're  a liar sometimes, Jerry. I've noticed  that about you.\" The press secretary's secretary,  a massive woman with  gray hair and impervious to  charm, guarded the portals of  his office with all the indomitable  will of the U. S. Marines.  But Jerry Bridges tried.\n\n\n \"You don't understand, Lana,\"  he said. \"I don't want to see Mr.  Howells. I just want you to give him something.\"\n\n\n \"My name's not Lana, and I can't deliver any messages.\"\n\n\n \"But this is something he wants to see.\" He handed her  an envelope, stamped URGENT.  \"Do it for me, Hedy. And I'll  buy you the flashiest pair of  diamond earrings in Washington.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" the woman said,  thawing slightly. \"I could deliver  it with his next batch of mail.\"\n\n\n \"When will that be?\"\n\n\n \"In an hour. He's in a terribly  important meeting right  now.\"\n\n\n \"You've got some mail right  there. Earrings and a bracelet  to match.\"\n\n\n She looked at him with exasperation,  and then gathered up  a stack of memorandums and  letters, his own envelope atop  it. She came out of the press  secretary's office two minutes  later with Howells himself, and  Howells said: \"You there,  Bridges. Come in here.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir !\" Jerry said, breezing  by the waiting reporters  with a grin of triumph.\n\n\n There were six men in the  room, three in military uniform.  Howells poked the envelope towards  Jerry, and snapped:\n\n\n \"This note of yours. Just what  do you think it means?\"\n\n\n \"You know better than I do,  Mr. Howells. I'm just doing my  job; I think the public has a  right to know about this spaceship  that's flying around\u2014\" His words brought an exclamation  from the others. Howells  sighed, and said:\n\n\n \"Mr. Bridges, you don't make  it easy for us. It's our opinion  that secrecy is essential, that  leakage of the story might cause  panic. Since you're the only unauthorized  person who knows of  it, we have two choices. One of  them is to lock you up.\"\n\n\n Jerry swallowed hard.\n\n\n \"The other is perhaps more  practical,\" Howells said. \"You'll  be taken into our confidence, and  allowed to accompany those officials  who will be admitted to the  landing site. But you will not be  allowed to relay the story to the  press until such a time as all correspondents are informed.  That won't give you a 'scoop' if  that's what you call it, but you'll  be an eyewitness. That should  be worth something.\"\n\n\n \"It's worth a lot,\" Jerry said  eagerly. \"Thanks, Mr. Howells.\"\n\n\n \"Don't thank me, I'm not doing  you any personal favor. Now  about the landing tonight\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You mean the spaceship's  coming down?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. A special foreign ministers  conference was held this  morning, and a decision was  reached to accept the delegate.  Landing instructions are being  given at Los Alamos, and the  ship will presumably land  around midnight tonight. There  will be a jet leaving Washington  Airport at nine, and you'll be  on it. Meanwhile, consider yourself  in custody.\" The USAF jet transport  wasn't the only secrecy-shrouded  aircraft that took off that evening  from Washington Airport.  But Jerry Bridges, sitting in  the rear seat flanked by two  Sphinx-like Secret Service men,  knew that he was the only passenger  with non-official status  aboard.\n\n\n It was only a few minutes  past ten when they arrived at  the air base at Los Alamos. The  desert sky was cloudy and starless,  and powerful searchlights  probed the thick cumulus. There  were sleek, purring black autos  waiting to rush the air passengers  to some unnamed destination.  They drove for twenty  minutes across a flat ribbon of  desert road, until Jerry sighted  what appeared to be a circle of  newly-erected lights in the middle  of nowhere. On the perimeter,  official vehicles were parked  in orderly rows, and four USAF  trailer trucks were in evidence,  their radarscopes turning slowly.  There was activity everywhere,  but it was well-ordered  and unhurried. They had done a  good job of keeping the excitement  contained.\n\n\n He was allowed to leave the  car and stroll unescorted. He  tried to talk to some of the  scurrying officials, but to no  avail. Finally, he contented  himself by sitting on the sand,  his back against the grill of a  staff car, smoking one cigarette  after another.\n\n\n As the minutes ticked off, the  activity became more frenetic  around him. Then the pace slowed,  and he knew the appointed  moment was approaching. Stillness  returned to the desert, and  tension was a tangible substance  in the night air.\n\n\n The radarscopes spun slowly.\n\n\n The searchlights converged  in an intricate pattern.\n\n\n Then the clouds seemed to  part!\n\n\n \"Here she comes!\" a voice  shouted. And in a moment, the  calm was shattered. At first, he  saw nothing. A faint roar was  started in the heavens, and it  became a growl that increased  in volume until even the shouting  voices could no longer be  heard. Then the crisscrossing  lights struck metal, glancing off  the gleaming body of a descending  object. Larger and larger  the object grew, until it assumed  the definable shape of a squat  silver funnel, falling in a perfect  straight line towards the center  of the light-ringed area. When it  hit, a dust cloud obscured it from  sight. A loudspeaker blared out an  unintelligible order, but its message  was clear. No one moved  from their position.\n\n\n Finally, a three-man team,  asbestos-clad, lead-shielded, stepped  out from the ring of spectators.  They carried geiger counters  on long poles before them.\n\n\n Jerry held his breath as they  approached the object; only  when they were yards away did  he appreciate its size. It wasn't  large; not more than fifteen feet  in total circumference.\n\n\n One of the three men waved  a gloved hand.\n\n\n \"It's okay,\" a voice breathed  behind him. \"No radiation ...\"\n\n\n Slowly, the ring of spectators  closed tighter. They were twenty  yards from the ship when the  voice spoke to them.\n\n\n \"Greetings from Venus,\" it  said, and then repeated the  phrase in six languages. \"The  ship you see is a Venusian Class  7 interplanetary rocket, built  for one-passenger. It is clear of  all radiation, and is perfectly  safe to approach. There is a  hatch which may be opened by  an automatic lever in the side.  Please open this hatch and remove  the passenger.\"\n\n\n An Air Force General whom  Jerry couldn't identify stepped  forward. He circled the ship  warily, and then said something  to the others. They came closer,  and he touched a small lever on  the silvery surface of the funnel.\n\n\n A door slid open.\n\n\n \"It's a box!\" someone said.\n\n\n \"A crate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Colligan! Moore! Schaffer!  Lend a hand here\u2014\"\n\n\n A trio came forward and  hoisted the crate out of the ship.  Then the voice spoke again;  Jerry deduced that it must have  been activated by the decreased  load of the ship.\n\n\n \"Please open the crate. You  will find our delegate within.  We trust you will treat him  with the courtesy of an official  emissary.\"\n\n\n They set to work on the crate,  its gray plastic material giving  in readily to the application of  their tools. But when it was  opened, they stood aside in  amazement and consternation.\n\n\n There were a variety of metal  pieces packed within, protected  by a filmy packing material.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute,\" the general  said. \"Here's a book\u2014\"\n\n\n He picked up a gray-bound  volume, and opened its cover.\n\n\n \"'Instructions for assembling  Delegate,'\" he read aloud.  \"'First, remove all parts and  arrange them in the following  order. A-1, central nervous system  housing. A-2 ...'\" He looked  up. \"It's an instruction book,\"  he whispered. \"We're supposed  to build the damn thing.\" The Delegate, a handsomely  constructed robot almost eight  feet tall, was pieced together  some three hours later, by a  team of scientists and engineers  who seemed to find the Venusian  instructions as elementary as a  blueprint in an Erector set. But  simple as the job was, they were  obviously impressed by the  mechanism they had assembled.  It stood impassive until they  obeyed the final instruction.  \"Press Button K ...\"\n\n\n They found button K, and  pressed it.\n\n\n The robot bowed.\n\n\n \"Thank you, gentlemen,\" it  said, in sweet, unmetallic accents.  \"Now if you will please  escort me to the meeting  place ...\" It wasn't until three days  after the landing that Jerry  Bridges saw the Delegate again.  Along with a dozen assorted  government officials, Army officers,  and scientists, he was  quartered in a quonset hut in  Fort Dix, New Jersey. Then,  after seventy-two frustrating  hours, he was escorted by Marine  guard into New York City.  No one told him his destination,  and it wasn't until he saw the  bright strips of light across the  face of the United Nations  building that he knew where the  meeting was to be held.\n\n\n But his greatest surprise was  yet to come. The vast auditorium  which housed the general  assembly was filled to its capacity,  but there were new faces  behind the plaques which designated  the member nations.  He couldn't believe his eyes at  first, but as the meeting got  under way, he knew that it was  true. The highest echelons of the  world's governments were represented,  even\u2014Jerry gulped  at the realization\u2014Nikita Khrushchev  himself. It was a summit  meeting such as he had never  dreamed possible, a summit  meeting without benefit of long  foreign minister's debate. And  the cause of it all, a placid,  highly-polished metal robot, was  seated blithely at a desk which  bore the designation: VENUS.\n\n\n The robot delegate stood up.\n\n\n \"Gentlemen,\" it said into the  microphone, and the great men  at the council tables strained to  hear the translator's version  through their headphones, \"Gentlemen,  I thank you for your  prompt attention. I come as a  Delegate from a great neighbor  planet, in the interests of peace  and progress for all the solar  system. I come in the belief that  peace is the responsibility of individuals,  of nations, and now  of worlds, and that each is dependent  upon the other. I speak  to you now through the electronic  instrumentation which  has been created for me, and I  come to offer your planet not  merely a threat, a promise, or  an easy solution\u2014but a challenge.\"\n\n\n The council room stirred.\n\n\n \"Your earth satellites have  been viewed with interest by the  astronomers of our world, and  we foresee the day when contact  between our planets will be commonplace.  As for ourselves, we  have hitherto had little desire  to explore beyond our realm,  being far too occupied with internal  matters. But our isolation  cannot last in the face of  your progress, so we believe that  we must take part in your  affairs.\n\n\n \"Here, then, is our challenge.  Continue your struggle of ideas,  compete with each other for the  minds of men, fight your bloodless  battles, if you know no  other means to attain progress.  But do all this without unleashing  the terrible forces of power  now at your command. Once  unleashed, these forces may or  may not destroy all that you  have gained. But we, the scientists  of Venus, promise you this\u2014that  on the very day your conflict  deteriorates into heedless  violence, we will not stand by  and let the ugly contagion  spread. On that day, we of  Venus will act swiftly, mercilessly,  and relentlessly\u2014to destroy  your world completely.\"\n\n\n Again, the meeting room exploded  in a babble of languages.\n\n\n \"The vessel which brought me  here came as a messenger of  peace. But envision it, men of  Earth, as a messenger of war.  Unstoppable, inexorable, it may  return, bearing a different Delegate  from Venus\u2014a Delegate of  Death, who speaks not in words,  but in the explosion of atoms.  Think of thousands of such Delegates,  fired from a vantage  point far beyond the reach of  your retaliation. This is the  promise and the challenge that  will hang in your night sky from  this moment forward. Look at  the planet Venus, men of Earth,  and see a Goddess of Vengeance,  poised to wreak its wrath upon  those who betray the peace.\"\n\n\n The Delegate sat down. Four days later, a mysterious  explosion rocked the quiet sands  of Los Alamos, and the Venus  spacecraft was no more. Two  hours after that, the robot delegate,  its message delivered, its  mission fulfilled, requested to be  locked inside a bombproof  chamber. When the door was  opened, the Delegate was an exploded  ruin.\n\n\n The news flashed with lightning  speed over the world, and  Jerry Bridges' eyewitness accounts  of the incredible event  was syndicated throughout the  nation. But his sudden celebrity  left him vaguely unsatisfied.\n\n\n He tried to explain his feeling  to Greta on his first night back  in Washington. They were in his  apartment, and it was the first  time Greta had consented to pay  him the visit.\n\n\n \"Well, what's bothering you?\"  Greta pouted. \"You've had the  biggest story of the year under  your byline. I should think you'd  be tickled pink.\"\n\n\n \"It's not that,\" Jerry said  moodily. \"But ever since I heard  the Delegate speak, something's  been nagging me.\"\n\n\n \"But don't you think he's done  good? Don't you think they'll be  impressed by what he said?\"\n\n\n \"I'm not worried about that.  I think that damn robot did  more for peace than anything  that's ever come along in this  cockeyed world. But still ...\"\n\n\n Greta snuggled up to him on  the sofa. \"You worry too much.  Don't you ever think of anything  else? You should learn to  relax. It can be fun.\"\n\n\n She started to prove it to him,  and Jerry responded the way a  normal, healthy male usually  does. But in the middle of an  embrace, he cried out:\n\n\n \"Wait a minute!\"\n\n\n \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\n \"I just thought of something!  Now where the hell did I put  my old notebooks?\"\n\n\n He got up from the sofa and  went scurrying to a closet. From  a debris of cardboard boxes, he  found a worn old leather brief  case, and cackled with delight  when he found the yellowed  notebooks inside.\n\n\n \"What are they?\" Greta said.\n\n\n \"My old school notebooks.  Greta, you'll have to excuse me.  But there's something I've got  to do, right away!\"\n\n\n \"That's all right with me,\"  Greta said haughtily. \"I know  when I'm not wanted.\"\n\n\n She took her hat and coat from  the hall closet, gave him one  last chance to change his mind,  and then left.\n\n\n Five minutes later, Jerry  Bridges was calling the airlines. It had been eleven years since  Jerry had walked across the  campus of Clifton University,  heading for the ivy-choked  main building. It was remarkable  how little had changed, but  the students seemed incredibly  young. He was winded by the  time he asked the pretty girl at  the desk where Professor Martin  Coltz could be located.\n\n\n \"Professor Coltz?\" She stuck  a pencil to her mouth. \"Well, I  guess he'd be in the Holland  Laboratory about now.\"\n\n\n \"Holland Laboratory? What's  that?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I guess that was after  your time, wasn't it?\"\n\n\n Jerry felt decrepit, but managed  to say: \"It must be something  new since I was here.  Where is this place?\"\n\n\n He followed her directions,  and located a fresh-painted  building three hundred yards  from the men's dorm. He met a  student at the door, who told  him that Professor Coltz would  be found in the physics department.\n\n\n The room was empty when  Jerry entered, except for the  single stooped figure vigorously  erasing a blackboard. He turned  when the door opened. If the  students looked younger, Professor  Coltz was far older than  Jerry remembered. He was a  tall man, with an unruly confusion  of straight gray hair. He  blinked when Jerry said:\n\n\n \"Hello, Professor. Do you remember  me? Jerry Bridges?\"\n\n\n \"Of course! I thought of you  only yesterday, when I saw your  name in the papers\u2014\"\n\n\n They sat at facing student  desks, and chatted about old  times. But Jerry was impatient  to get to the point of his visit,  and he blurted out:\n\n\n \"Professor Coltz, something's  been bothering me. It bothered  me from the moment I heard  the Delegate speak. I didn't  know what it was until last  night, when I dug out my old  college notebooks. Thank God  I kept them.\"\n\n\n Coltz's eyes were suddenly  hooded.\n\n\n \"What do you mean, Jerry?\"\n\n\n \"There was something about  the Robot's speech that sounded  familiar\u2014I could have sworn  I'd heard some of the words  before. I couldn't prove anything  until I checked my old  notes, and here's what I found.\"\n\n\n He dug into his coat pocket  and produced a sheet of paper.  He unfolded it and read aloud.\n\n\n \"'It's my belief that peace is  the responsibility of individuals,  of nations, and someday, even of  worlds ...' Sound familiar, Professor?\"\n\n\n Coltz shifted uncomfortably.  \"I don't recall every silly thing  I said, Jerry.\"\n\n\n \"But it's an interesting coincidence,  isn't it, Professor?  These very words were spoken  by the Delegate from Venus.\"\n\n\n \"A coincidence\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is it? But I also remember  your interest in robotics. I'll  never forget that mechanical  homing pigeon you constructed.  And you've probably learned  much more these past eleven  years.\"\n\n\n \"What are you driving at,  Jerry?\"\n\n\n \"Just this, Professor. I had a  little daydream, recently, and I  want you to hear it. I dreamed  about a group of teachers, scientists,  and engineers, a group  who were suddenly struck by  an exciting, incredible idea. A  group that worked in the quiet  and secrecy of a University on a  fantastic scheme to force the  idea of peace into the minds of  the world's big shots. Does my  dream interest you, Professor?\"\n\n\n \"Go on.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I dreamt that this  group would secretly launch an  earth satellite of their own, and  arrange for the nose cone to  come down safely at a certain  time and place. They would install  a marvelous electronic robot  within the cone, ready to be  assembled. They would beam a  radio message to earth from the  cone, seemingly as if it originated  from their 'spaceship.'  Then, when the Robot was assembled,  they would speak  through it to demand peace for  all mankind ...\"\n\n\n \"Jerry, if you do this\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You don't have to say it,  Professor, I know what you're  thinking. I'm a reporter, and my  business is to tell the world  everything I know. But if I  did it, there might not be a  world for me to write about,  would there? No, thanks, Professor.  As far as I'm concerned,  what I told you was nothing  more than a daydream.\" Jerry braked the convertible  to a halt, and put his arm  around Greta's shoulder. She  looked up at the star-filled night,  and sighed romantically.\n\n\n Jerry pointed. \"That one.\"\n\n\n Greta shivered closer to him.\n\n\n \"And to think what that terrible  planet can do to us!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I dunno. Venus is also  the Goddess of Love.\"\n\n\n He swung his other arm  around her, and Venus winked  approvingly.

The\n\n DELEGATE\n\n FROM\n\n VENUS By HENRY SLESAR ILLUSTRATOR NOVICK Everybody was waiting to see  what the delegate from Venus  looked like. And all they got  for their patience was the  biggest surprise since David  clobbered Goliath. \"  Let  me put it this way,\"  Conners said paternally.  \"We expect a certain amount of  decorum from our Washington  news correspondents, and that's  all I'm asking for.\"\n\n\n Jerry Bridges, sitting in the  chair opposite his employer's  desk, chewed on his knuckles  and said nothing. One part of  his mind wanted him to play it  cagey, to behave the way the  newspaper wanted him to behave,  to protect the cozy Washington  assignment he had waited  four years to get. But another  part of him, a rebel part,  wanted him to stay on the trail  of the story he felt sure was  about to break.\n\n\n \"I didn't mean to make trouble,  Mr. Conners,\" he said casually.  \"It just seemed strange, all  these exchanges of couriers in  the past two days. I couldn't  help thinking something was  up.\"\n\n\n \"Even if that's true, we'll  hear about it through the usual  channels,\" Conners frowned.  \"But getting a senator's secretary  drunk to obtain information\u2014well,  that's not only indiscreet,  Bridges. It's downright  dirty.\"\n\n\n Jerry grinned. \"I didn't take that kind of advantage, Mr.  Conners. Not that she wasn't a  toothsome little dish ...\"\n\n\n \"Just thank your lucky stars  that it didn't go any further.  And from now on\u2014\" He waggled  a finger at him. \"Watch  your step.\"\n\n\n Jerry got up and ambled to the  door. But he turned before leaving  and said:\n\n\n \"By the way. What do you think is going on?\"\n\n\n \"I haven't the faintest idea.\"\n\n\n \"Don't kid me, Mr. Conners.  Think it's war?\"\n\n\n \"That'll be all, Bridges.\" The reporter closed the door  behind him, and then strolled  out of the building into the sunlight.\n\n\n He met Ruskin, the fat little  AP correspondent, in front of  the Pan-American Building on  Constitution Avenue. Ruskin  was holding the newspaper that  contained the gossip-column  item which had started the  whole affair, and he seemed  more interested in the romantic  rather than political implications.  As he walked beside him,  he said:\n\n\n \"So what really happened,  pal? That Greta babe really let  down her hair?\"\n\n\n \"Where's your decorum?\"  Jerry growled.\n\n\n Ruskin giggled. \"Boy, she's  quite a dame, all right. I think  they ought to get the Secret  Service to guard her. She really  fills out a size 10, don't she?\"\n\n\n \"Ruskin,\" Jerry said, \"you  have a low mind. For a week,  this town has been acting like  the 39 Steps , and all you can  think about is dames. What's  the matter with you? Where  will you be when the big mushroom  cloud comes?\"\n\n\n \"With Greta, I hope,\" Ruskin  sighed. \"What a way to get  radioactive.\"\n\n\n They split off a few blocks  later, and Jerry walked until he  came to the Red Tape Bar &amp;  Grill, a favorite hangout of the  local journalists. There were  three other newsmen at the bar,  and they gave him snickering  greetings. He took a small table  in the rear and ate his meal in  sullen silence.\n\n\n It wasn't the newsmen's jibes  that bothered him; it was the  certainty that something of  major importance was happening  in the capitol. There had  been hourly conferences at the  White House, flying visits by  State Department officials, mysterious  conferences involving  members of the Science Commission.  So far, the byword  had been secrecy. They knew  that Senator Spocker, chairman  of the Congressional Science  Committee, had been involved  in every meeting, but Senator  Spocker was unavailable. His  secretary, however, was a little  more obliging ...\n\n\n Jerry looked up from his  coffee and blinked when he saw  who was coming through the  door of the Bar &amp; Grill. So did  every other patron, but for different  reasons. Greta Johnson  had that effect upon men. Even  the confining effect of a mannishly-tailored  suit didn't hide  her outrageously feminine qualities.\n\n\n She walked straight to his  table, and he stood up.\n\n\n \"They told me you might be  here,\" she said, breathing hard.  \"I just wanted to thank you for  last night.\"\n\n\n \"Look, Greta\u2014\" Wham! Her hand, small and  delicate, felt like a slab of lead  when it slammed into his cheek.  She left a bruise five fingers  wide, and then turned and stalked  out. He ran after her, the restaurant  proprietor shouting about  the unpaid bill. It took a rapid  dog-trot to reach her side.\n\n\n \"Greta, listen!\" he panted.  \"You don't understand about  last night. It wasn't the way  that lousy columnist said\u2014\"\n\n\n She stopped in her tracks.\n\n\n \"I wouldn't have minded so  much if you'd gotten me drunk.  But to use me, just to get a  story\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But I'm a reporter , damn it.  It's my job. I'd do it again if  I thought you knew anything.\"\n\n\n She was pouting now. \"Well,  how do you suppose I feel,  knowing you're only interested  in me because of the Senator?  Anyway, I'll probably lose my  job, and then you won't have any use for me.\"\n\n\n \"Good-bye, Greta,\" Jerry said  sadly.\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"Good-bye. I suppose you  won't want to see me any more.\"\n\n\n \"Did I say that?\"\n\n\n \"It just won't be any use.  We'll always have this thing between  us.\"\n\n\n She looked at him for a moment,  and then touched his  bruised cheek with a tender,  motherly gesture.\n\n\n \"Your poor face,\" she murmured,  and then sighed. \"Oh,  well. I guess there's no use  fighting it. Maybe if I did tell  you what I know, we could act human again.\"\n\n\n \"Greta!\"\n\n\n \"But if you print one word of it, Jerry Bridges, I'll never  speak to you again!\"\n\n\n \"Honey,\" Jerry said, taking  her arm, \"you can trust me like  a brother.\"\n\n\n \"That's not the idea,\" Greta  said stiffly.\n\n\n In a secluded booth at the rear  of a restaurant unfrequented by  newsmen, Greta leaned forward  and said:\n\n\n \"At first, they thought it was  another sputnik.\"\n\n\n \" Who did?\"\n\n\n \"The State Department, silly.  They got reports from the observatories  about another sputnik  being launched by the Russians.  Only the Russians denied  it. Then there were joint meetings,  and nobody could figure  out what the damn thing was.\"\n\n\n \"Wait a minute,\" Jerry said  dizzily. \"You mean to tell me  there's another of those metal  moons up there?\"\n\n\n \"But it's not a moon. That's  the big point. It's a spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"A what ?\"\n\n\n \"A spaceship,\" Greta said  coolly, sipping lemonade. \"They  have been in contact with it now  for about three days, and they're  thinking of calling a plenary  session of the UN just to figure  out what to do about it. The  only hitch is, Russia doesn't  want to wait that long, and is  asking for a hurry-up summit  meeting to make a decision.\"\n\n\n \"A decision about what?\"\n\n\n \"About the Venusians, of  course.\"\n\n\n \"Greta,\" Jerry said mildly, \"I  think you're still a little woozy  from last night.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be silly. The spaceship's  from Venus; they've already  established that. And the  people on it\u2014I guess they're  people\u2014want to know if they  can land their delegate.\"\n\n\n \"Their what?\"\n\n\n \"Their delegate. They came  here for some kind of conference,  I guess. They know about  the UN and everything, and  they want to take part. They  say that with all the satellites  being launched, that our affairs  are their affairs, too. It's kind  of confusing, but that's what  they say.\"\n\n\n \"You mean these Venusians  speak English?\"\n\n\n \"And Russian. And French.  And German. And everything I  guess. They've been having  radio talks with practically  every country for the past three  days. Like I say, they want to  establish diplomatic relations  or something. The Senator  thinks that if we don't agree,  they might do something drastic,  like blow us all up. It's kind  of scary.\" She shivered delicately.\n\n\n \"You're taking it mighty  calm,\" he said ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, how else can I take it?  I'm not even supposed to know about it, except that the Senator  is so careless about\u2014\" She  put her fingers to her lips. \"Oh,  dear, now you'll really think I'm  terrible.\"\n\n\n \"Terrible? I think you're  wonderful!\"\n\n\n \"And you promise not to print  it?\"\n\n\n \"Didn't I say I wouldn't?\"\n\n\n \"Y-e-s. But you know, you're  a liar sometimes, Jerry. I've noticed  that about you.\" The press secretary's secretary,  a massive woman with  gray hair and impervious to  charm, guarded the portals of  his office with all the indomitable  will of the U. S. Marines.  But Jerry Bridges tried.\n\n\n \"You don't understand, Lana,\"  he said. \"I don't want to see Mr.  Howells. I just want you to give him something.\"\n\n\n \"My name's not Lana, and I can't deliver any messages.\"\n\n\n \"But this is something he wants to see.\" He handed her  an envelope, stamped URGENT.  \"Do it for me, Hedy. And I'll  buy you the flashiest pair of  diamond earrings in Washington.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" the woman said,  thawing slightly. \"I could deliver  it with his next batch of mail.\"\n\n\n \"When will that be?\"\n\n\n \"In an hour. He's in a terribly  important meeting right  now.\"\n\n\n \"You've got some mail right  there. Earrings and a bracelet  to match.\"\n\n\n She looked at him with exasperation,  and then gathered up  a stack of memorandums and  letters, his own envelope atop  it. She came out of the press  secretary's office two minutes  later with Howells himself, and  Howells said: \"You there,  Bridges. Come in here.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir !\" Jerry said, breezing  by the waiting reporters  with a grin of triumph.\n\n\n There were six men in the  room, three in military uniform.  Howells poked the envelope towards  Jerry, and snapped:\n\n\n \"This note of yours. Just what  do you think it means?\"\n\n\n \"You know better than I do,  Mr. Howells. I'm just doing my  job; I think the public has a  right to know about this spaceship  that's flying around\u2014\" His words brought an exclamation  from the others. Howells  sighed, and said:\n\n\n \"Mr. Bridges, you don't make  it easy for us. It's our opinion  that secrecy is essential, that  leakage of the story might cause  panic. Since you're the only unauthorized  person who knows of  it, we have two choices. One of  them is to lock you up.\"\n\n\n Jerry swallowed hard.\n\n\n \"The other is perhaps more  practical,\" Howells said. \"You'll  be taken into our confidence, and  allowed to accompany those officials  who will be admitted to the  landing site. But you will not be  allowed to relay the story to the  press until such a time as all correspondents are informed.  That won't give you a 'scoop' if  that's what you call it, but you'll  be an eyewitness. That should  be worth something.\"\n\n\n \"It's worth a lot,\" Jerry said  eagerly. \"Thanks, Mr. Howells.\"\n\n\n \"Don't thank me, I'm not doing  you any personal favor. Now  about the landing tonight\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You mean the spaceship's  coming down?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. A special foreign ministers  conference was held this  morning, and a decision was  reached to accept the delegate.  Landing instructions are being  given at Los Alamos, and the  ship will presumably land  around midnight tonight. There  will be a jet leaving Washington  Airport at nine, and you'll be  on it. Meanwhile, consider yourself  in custody.\" The USAF jet transport  wasn't the only secrecy-shrouded  aircraft that took off that evening  from Washington Airport.  But Jerry Bridges, sitting in  the rear seat flanked by two  Sphinx-like Secret Service men,  knew that he was the only passenger  with non-official status  aboard.\n\n\n It was only a few minutes  past ten when they arrived at  the air base at Los Alamos. The  desert sky was cloudy and starless,  and powerful searchlights  probed the thick cumulus. There  were sleek, purring black autos  waiting to rush the air passengers  to some unnamed destination.  They drove for twenty  minutes across a flat ribbon of  desert road, until Jerry sighted  what appeared to be a circle of  newly-erected lights in the middle  of nowhere. On the perimeter,  official vehicles were parked  in orderly rows, and four USAF  trailer trucks were in evidence,  their radarscopes turning slowly.  There was activity everywhere,  but it was well-ordered  and unhurried. They had done a  good job of keeping the excitement  contained.\n\n\n He was allowed to leave the  car and stroll unescorted. He  tried to talk to some of the  scurrying officials, but to no  avail. Finally, he contented  himself by sitting on the sand,  his back against the grill of a  staff car, smoking one cigarette  after another.\n\n\n As the minutes ticked off, the  activity became more frenetic  around him. Then the pace slowed,  and he knew the appointed  moment was approaching. Stillness  returned to the desert, and  tension was a tangible substance  in the night air.\n\n\n The radarscopes spun slowly.\n\n\n The searchlights converged  in an intricate pattern.\n\n\n Then the clouds seemed to  part!\n\n\n \"Here she comes!\" a voice  shouted. And in a moment, the  calm was shattered. At first, he  saw nothing. A faint roar was  started in the heavens, and it  became a growl that increased  in volume until even the shouting  voices could no longer be  heard. Then the crisscrossing  lights struck metal, glancing off  the gleaming body of a descending  object. Larger and larger  the object grew, until it assumed  the definable shape of a squat  silver funnel, falling in a perfect  straight line towards the center  of the light-ringed area. When it  hit, a dust cloud obscured it from  sight. A loudspeaker blared out an  unintelligible order, but its message  was clear. No one moved  from their position.\n\n\n Finally, a three-man team,  asbestos-clad, lead-shielded, stepped  out from the ring of spectators.  They carried geiger counters  on long poles before them.\n\n\n Jerry held his breath as they  approached the object; only  when they were yards away did  he appreciate its size. It wasn't  large; not more than fifteen feet  in total circumference.\n\n\n One of the three men waved  a gloved hand.\n\n\n \"It's okay,\" a voice breathed  behind him. \"No radiation ...\"\n\n\n Slowly, the ring of spectators  closed tighter. They were twenty  yards from the ship when the  voice spoke to them.\n\n\n \"Greetings from Venus,\" it  said, and then repeated the  phrase in six languages. \"The  ship you see is a Venusian Class  7 interplanetary rocket, built  for one-passenger. It is clear of  all radiation, and is perfectly  safe to approach. There is a  hatch which may be opened by  an automatic lever in the side.  Please open this hatch and remove  the passenger.\"\n\n\n An Air Force General whom  Jerry couldn't identify stepped  forward. He circled the ship  warily, and then said something  to the others. They came closer,  and he touched a small lever on  the silvery surface of the funnel.\n\n\n A door slid open.\n\n\n \"It's a box!\" someone said.\n\n\n \"A crate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Colligan! Moore! Schaffer!  Lend a hand here\u2014\"\n\n\n A trio came forward and  hoisted the crate out of the ship.  Then the voice spoke again;  Jerry deduced that it must have  been activated by the decreased  load of the ship.\n\n\n \"Please open the crate. You  will find our delegate within.  We trust you will treat him  with the courtesy of an official  emissary.\"\n\n\n They set to work on the crate,  its gray plastic material giving  in readily to the application of  their tools. But when it was  opened, they stood aside in  amazement and consternation.\n\n\n There were a variety of metal  pieces packed within, protected  by a filmy packing material.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute,\" the general  said. \"Here's a book\u2014\"\n\n\n He picked up a gray-bound  volume, and opened its cover.\n\n\n \"'Instructions for assembling  Delegate,'\" he read aloud.  \"'First, remove all parts and  arrange them in the following  order. A-1, central nervous system  housing. A-2 ...'\" He looked  up. \"It's an instruction book,\"  he whispered. \"We're supposed  to build the damn thing.\" The Delegate, a handsomely  constructed robot almost eight  feet tall, was pieced together  some three hours later, by a  team of scientists and engineers  who seemed to find the Venusian  instructions as elementary as a  blueprint in an Erector set. But  simple as the job was, they were  obviously impressed by the  mechanism they had assembled.  It stood impassive until they  obeyed the final instruction.  \"Press Button K ...\"\n\n\n They found button K, and  pressed it.\n\n\n The robot bowed.\n\n\n \"Thank you, gentlemen,\" it  said, in sweet, unmetallic accents.  \"Now if you will please  escort me to the meeting  place ...\" It wasn't until three days  after the landing that Jerry  Bridges saw the Delegate again.  Along with a dozen assorted  government officials, Army officers,  and scientists, he was  quartered in a quonset hut in  Fort Dix, New Jersey. Then,  after seventy-two frustrating  hours, he was escorted by Marine  guard into New York City.  No one told him his destination,  and it wasn't until he saw the  bright strips of light across the  face of the United Nations  building that he knew where the  meeting was to be held.\n\n\n But his greatest surprise was  yet to come. The vast auditorium  which housed the general  assembly was filled to its capacity,  but there were new faces  behind the plaques which designated  the member nations.  He couldn't believe his eyes at  first, but as the meeting got  under way, he knew that it was  true. The highest echelons of the  world's governments were represented,  even\u2014Jerry gulped  at the realization\u2014Nikita Khrushchev  himself. It was a summit  meeting such as he had never  dreamed possible, a summit  meeting without benefit of long  foreign minister's debate. And  the cause of it all, a placid,  highly-polished metal robot, was  seated blithely at a desk which  bore the designation: VENUS.\n\n\n The robot delegate stood up.\n\n\n \"Gentlemen,\" it said into the  microphone, and the great men  at the council tables strained to  hear the translator's version  through their headphones, \"Gentlemen,  I thank you for your  prompt attention. I come as a  Delegate from a great neighbor  planet, in the interests of peace  and progress for all the solar  system. I come in the belief that  peace is the responsibility of individuals,  of nations, and now  of worlds, and that each is dependent  upon the other. I speak  to you now through the electronic  instrumentation which  has been created for me, and I  come to offer your planet not  merely a threat, a promise, or  an easy solution\u2014but a challenge.\"\n\n\n The council room stirred.\n\n\n \"Your earth satellites have  been viewed with interest by the  astronomers of our world, and  we foresee the day when contact  between our planets will be commonplace.  As for ourselves, we  have hitherto had little desire  to explore beyond our realm,  being far too occupied with internal  matters. But our isolation  cannot last in the face of  your progress, so we believe that  we must take part in your  affairs.\n\n\n \"Here, then, is our challenge.  Continue your struggle of ideas,  compete with each other for the  minds of men, fight your bloodless  battles, if you know no  other means to attain progress.  But do all this without unleashing  the terrible forces of power  now at your command. Once  unleashed, these forces may or  may not destroy all that you  have gained. But we, the scientists  of Venus, promise you this\u2014that  on the very day your conflict  deteriorates into heedless  violence, we will not stand by  and let the ugly contagion  spread. On that day, we of  Venus will act swiftly, mercilessly,  and relentlessly\u2014to destroy  your world completely.\"\n\n\n Again, the meeting room exploded  in a babble of languages.\n\n\n \"The vessel which brought me  here came as a messenger of  peace. But envision it, men of  Earth, as a messenger of war.  Unstoppable, inexorable, it may  return, bearing a different Delegate  from Venus\u2014a Delegate of  Death, who speaks not in words,  but in the explosion of atoms.  Think of thousands of such Delegates,  fired from a vantage  point far beyond the reach of  your retaliation. This is the  promise and the challenge that  will hang in your night sky from  this moment forward. Look at  the planet Venus, men of Earth,  and see a Goddess of Vengeance,  poised to wreak its wrath upon  those who betray the peace.\"\n\n\n The Delegate sat down. Four days later, a mysterious  explosion rocked the quiet sands  of Los Alamos, and the Venus  spacecraft was no more. Two  hours after that, the robot delegate,  its message delivered, its  mission fulfilled, requested to be  locked inside a bombproof  chamber. When the door was  opened, the Delegate was an exploded  ruin.\n\n\n The news flashed with lightning  speed over the world, and  Jerry Bridges' eyewitness accounts  of the incredible event  was syndicated throughout the  nation. But his sudden celebrity  left him vaguely unsatisfied.\n\n\n He tried to explain his feeling  to Greta on his first night back  in Washington. They were in his  apartment, and it was the first  time Greta had consented to pay  him the visit.\n\n\n \"Well, what's bothering you?\"  Greta pouted. \"You've had the  biggest story of the year under  your byline. I should think you'd  be tickled pink.\"\n\n\n \"It's not that,\" Jerry said  moodily. \"But ever since I heard  the Delegate speak, something's  been nagging me.\"\n\n\n \"But don't you think he's done  good? Don't you think they'll be  impressed by what he said?\"\n\n\n \"I'm not worried about that.  I think that damn robot did  more for peace than anything  that's ever come along in this  cockeyed world. But still ...\"\n\n\n Greta snuggled up to him on  the sofa. \"You worry too much.  Don't you ever think of anything  else? You should learn to  relax. It can be fun.\"\n\n\n She started to prove it to him,  and Jerry responded the way a  normal, healthy male usually  does. But in the middle of an  embrace, he cried out:\n\n\n \"Wait a minute!\"\n\n\n \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\n \"I just thought of something!  Now where the hell did I put  my old notebooks?\"\n\n\n He got up from the sofa and  went scurrying to a closet. From  a debris of cardboard boxes, he  found a worn old leather brief  case, and cackled with delight  when he found the yellowed  notebooks inside.\n\n\n \"What are they?\" Greta said.\n\n\n \"My old school notebooks.  Greta, you'll have to excuse me.  But there's something I've got  to do, right away!\"\n\n\n \"That's all right with me,\"  Greta said haughtily. \"I know  when I'm not wanted.\"\n\n\n She took her hat and coat from  the hall closet, gave him one  last chance to change his mind,  and then left.\n\n\n Five minutes later, Jerry  Bridges was calling the airlines. It had been eleven years since  Jerry had walked across the  campus of Clifton University,  heading for the ivy-choked  main building. It was remarkable  how little had changed, but  the students seemed incredibly  young. He was winded by the  time he asked the pretty girl at  the desk where Professor Martin  Coltz could be located.\n\n\n \"Professor Coltz?\" She stuck  a pencil to her mouth. \"Well, I  guess he'd be in the Holland  Laboratory about now.\"\n\n\n \"Holland Laboratory? What's  that?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I guess that was after  your time, wasn't it?\"\n\n\n Jerry felt decrepit, but managed  to say: \"It must be something  new since I was here.  Where is this place?\"\n\n\n He followed her directions,  and located a fresh-painted  building three hundred yards  from the men's dorm. He met a  student at the door, who told  him that Professor Coltz would  be found in the physics department.\n\n\n The room was empty when  Jerry entered, except for the  single stooped figure vigorously  erasing a blackboard. He turned  when the door opened. If the  students looked younger, Professor  Coltz was far older than  Jerry remembered. He was a  tall man, with an unruly confusion  of straight gray hair. He  blinked when Jerry said:\n\n\n \"Hello, Professor. Do you remember  me? Jerry Bridges?\"\n\n\n \"Of course! I thought of you  only yesterday, when I saw your  name in the papers\u2014\"\n\n\n They sat at facing student  desks, and chatted about old  times. But Jerry was impatient  to get to the point of his visit,  and he blurted out:\n\n\n \"Professor Coltz, something's  been bothering me. It bothered  me from the moment I heard  the Delegate speak. I didn't  know what it was until last  night, when I dug out my old  college notebooks. Thank God  I kept them.\"\n\n\n Coltz's eyes were suddenly  hooded.\n\n\n \"What do you mean, Jerry?\"\n\n\n \"There was something about  the Robot's speech that sounded  familiar\u2014I could have sworn  I'd heard some of the words  before. I couldn't prove anything  until I checked my old  notes, and here's what I found.\"\n\n\n He dug into his coat pocket  and produced a sheet of paper.  He unfolded it and read aloud.\n\n\n \"'It's my belief that peace is  the responsibility of individuals,  of nations, and someday, even of  worlds ...' Sound familiar, Professor?\"\n\n\n Coltz shifted uncomfortably.  \"I don't recall every silly thing  I said, Jerry.\"\n\n\n \"But it's an interesting coincidence,  isn't it, Professor?  These very words were spoken  by the Delegate from Venus.\"\n\n\n \"A coincidence\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is it? But I also remember  your interest in robotics. I'll  never forget that mechanical  homing pigeon you constructed.  And you've probably learned  much more these past eleven  years.\"\n\n\n \"What are you driving at,  Jerry?\"\n\n\n \"Just this, Professor. I had a  little daydream, recently, and I  want you to hear it. I dreamed  about a group of teachers, scientists,  and engineers, a group  who were suddenly struck by  an exciting, incredible idea. A  group that worked in the quiet  and secrecy of a University on a  fantastic scheme to force the  idea of peace into the minds of  the world's big shots. Does my  dream interest you, Professor?\"\n\n\n \"Go on.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I dreamt that this  group would secretly launch an  earth satellite of their own, and  arrange for the nose cone to  come down safely at a certain  time and place. They would install  a marvelous electronic robot  within the cone, ready to be  assembled. They would beam a  radio message to earth from the  cone, seemingly as if it originated  from their 'spaceship.'  Then, when the Robot was assembled,  they would speak  through it to demand peace for  all mankind ...\"\n\n\n \"Jerry, if you do this\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You don't have to say it,  Professor, I know what you're  thinking. I'm a reporter, and my  business is to tell the world  everything I know. But if I  did it, there might not be a  world for me to write about,  would there? No, thanks, Professor.  As far as I'm concerned,  what I told you was nothing  more than a daydream.\" Jerry braked the convertible  to a halt, and put his arm  around Greta's shoulder. She  looked up at the star-filled night,  and sighed romantically.\n\n\n Jerry pointed. \"That one.\"\n\n\n Greta shivered closer to him.\n\n\n \"And to think what that terrible  planet can do to us!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I dunno. Venus is also  the Goddess of Love.\"\n\n\n He swung his other arm  around her, and Venus winked  approvingly.

The\n\n DELEGATE\n\n FROM\n\n VENUS By HENRY SLESAR ILLUSTRATOR NOVICK Everybody was waiting to see  what the delegate from Venus  looked like. And all they got  for their patience was the  biggest surprise since David  clobbered Goliath. \"  Let  me put it this way,\"  Conners said paternally.  \"We expect a certain amount of  decorum from our Washington  news correspondents, and that's  all I'm asking for.\"\n\n\n Jerry Bridges, sitting in the  chair opposite his employer's  desk, chewed on his knuckles  and said nothing. One part of  his mind wanted him to play it  cagey, to behave the way the  newspaper wanted him to behave,  to protect the cozy Washington  assignment he had waited  four years to get. But another  part of him, a rebel part,  wanted him to stay on the trail  of the story he felt sure was  about to break.\n\n\n \"I didn't mean to make trouble,  Mr. Conners,\" he said casually.  \"It just seemed strange, all  these exchanges of couriers in  the past two days. I couldn't  help thinking something was  up.\"\n\n\n \"Even if that's true, we'll  hear about it through the usual  channels,\" Conners frowned.  \"But getting a senator's secretary  drunk to obtain information\u2014well,  that's not only indiscreet,  Bridges. It's downright  dirty.\"\n\n\n Jerry grinned. \"I didn't take that kind of advantage, Mr.  Conners. Not that she wasn't a  toothsome little dish ...\"\n\n\n \"Just thank your lucky stars  that it didn't go any further.  And from now on\u2014\" He waggled  a finger at him. \"Watch  your step.\"\n\n\n Jerry got up and ambled to the  door. But he turned before leaving  and said:\n\n\n \"By the way. What do you think is going on?\"\n\n\n \"I haven't the faintest idea.\"\n\n\n \"Don't kid me, Mr. Conners.  Think it's war?\"\n\n\n \"That'll be all, Bridges.\" The reporter closed the door  behind him, and then strolled  out of the building into the sunlight.\n\n\n He met Ruskin, the fat little  AP correspondent, in front of  the Pan-American Building on  Constitution Avenue. Ruskin  was holding the newspaper that  contained the gossip-column  item which had started the  whole affair, and he seemed  more interested in the romantic  rather than political implications.  As he walked beside him,  he said:\n\n\n \"So what really happened,  pal? That Greta babe really let  down her hair?\"\n\n\n \"Where's your decorum?\"  Jerry growled.\n\n\n Ruskin giggled. \"Boy, she's  quite a dame, all right. I think  they ought to get the Secret  Service to guard her. She really  fills out a size 10, don't she?\"\n\n\n \"Ruskin,\" Jerry said, \"you  have a low mind. For a week,  this town has been acting like  the 39 Steps , and all you can  think about is dames. What's  the matter with you? Where  will you be when the big mushroom  cloud comes?\"\n\n\n \"With Greta, I hope,\" Ruskin  sighed. \"What a way to get  radioactive.\"\n\n\n They split off a few blocks  later, and Jerry walked until he  came to the Red Tape Bar &amp;  Grill, a favorite hangout of the  local journalists. There were  three other newsmen at the bar,  and they gave him snickering  greetings. He took a small table  in the rear and ate his meal in  sullen silence.\n\n\n It wasn't the newsmen's jibes  that bothered him; it was the  certainty that something of  major importance was happening  in the capitol. There had  been hourly conferences at the  White House, flying visits by  State Department officials, mysterious  conferences involving  members of the Science Commission.  So far, the byword  had been secrecy. They knew  that Senator Spocker, chairman  of the Congressional Science  Committee, had been involved  in every meeting, but Senator  Spocker was unavailable. His  secretary, however, was a little  more obliging ...\n\n\n Jerry looked up from his  coffee and blinked when he saw  who was coming through the  door of the Bar &amp; Grill. So did  every other patron, but for different  reasons. Greta Johnson  had that effect upon men. Even  the confining effect of a mannishly-tailored  suit didn't hide  her outrageously feminine qualities.\n\n\n She walked straight to his  table, and he stood up.\n\n\n \"They told me you might be  here,\" she said, breathing hard.  \"I just wanted to thank you for  last night.\"\n\n\n \"Look, Greta\u2014\" Wham! Her hand, small and  delicate, felt like a slab of lead  when it slammed into his cheek.  She left a bruise five fingers  wide, and then turned and stalked  out. He ran after her, the restaurant  proprietor shouting about  the unpaid bill. It took a rapid  dog-trot to reach her side.\n\n\n \"Greta, listen!\" he panted.  \"You don't understand about  last night. It wasn't the way  that lousy columnist said\u2014\"\n\n\n She stopped in her tracks.\n\n\n \"I wouldn't have minded so  much if you'd gotten me drunk.  But to use me, just to get a  story\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But I'm a reporter , damn it.  It's my job. I'd do it again if  I thought you knew anything.\"\n\n\n She was pouting now. \"Well,  how do you suppose I feel,  knowing you're only interested  in me because of the Senator?  Anyway, I'll probably lose my  job, and then you won't have any use for me.\"\n\n\n \"Good-bye, Greta,\" Jerry said  sadly.\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"Good-bye. I suppose you  won't want to see me any more.\"\n\n\n \"Did I say that?\"\n\n\n \"It just won't be any use.  We'll always have this thing between  us.\"\n\n\n She looked at him for a moment,  and then touched his  bruised cheek with a tender,  motherly gesture.\n\n\n \"Your poor face,\" she murmured,  and then sighed. \"Oh,  well. I guess there's no use  fighting it. Maybe if I did tell  you what I know, we could act human again.\"\n\n\n \"Greta!\"\n\n\n \"But if you print one word of it, Jerry Bridges, I'll never  speak to you again!\"\n\n\n \"Honey,\" Jerry said, taking  her arm, \"you can trust me like  a brother.\"\n\n\n \"That's not the idea,\" Greta  said stiffly.\n\n\n In a secluded booth at the rear  of a restaurant unfrequented by  newsmen, Greta leaned forward  and said:\n\n\n \"At first, they thought it was  another sputnik.\"\n\n\n \" Who did?\"\n\n\n \"The State Department, silly.  They got reports from the observatories  about another sputnik  being launched by the Russians.  Only the Russians denied  it. Then there were joint meetings,  and nobody could figure  out what the damn thing was.\"\n\n\n \"Wait a minute,\" Jerry said  dizzily. \"You mean to tell me  there's another of those metal  moons up there?\"\n\n\n \"But it's not a moon. That's  the big point. It's a spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"A what ?\"\n\n\n \"A spaceship,\" Greta said  coolly, sipping lemonade. \"They  have been in contact with it now  for about three days, and they're  thinking of calling a plenary  session of the UN just to figure  out what to do about it. The  only hitch is, Russia doesn't  want to wait that long, and is  asking for a hurry-up summit  meeting to make a decision.\"\n\n\n \"A decision about what?\"\n\n\n \"About the Venusians, of  course.\"\n\n\n \"Greta,\" Jerry said mildly, \"I  think you're still a little woozy  from last night.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be silly. The spaceship's  from Venus; they've already  established that. And the  people on it\u2014I guess they're  people\u2014want to know if they  can land their delegate.\"\n\n\n \"Their what?\"\n\n\n \"Their delegate. They came  here for some kind of conference,  I guess. They know about  the UN and everything, and  they want to take part. They  say that with all the satellites  being launched, that our affairs  are their affairs, too. It's kind  of confusing, but that's what  they say.\"\n\n\n \"You mean these Venusians  speak English?\"\n\n\n \"And Russian. And French.  And German. And everything I  guess. They've been having  radio talks with practically  every country for the past three  days. Like I say, they want to  establish diplomatic relations  or something. The Senator  thinks that if we don't agree,  they might do something drastic,  like blow us all up. It's kind  of scary.\" She shivered delicately.\n\n\n \"You're taking it mighty  calm,\" he said ironically.\n\n\n \"Well, how else can I take it?  I'm not even supposed to know about it, except that the Senator  is so careless about\u2014\" She  put her fingers to her lips. \"Oh,  dear, now you'll really think I'm  terrible.\"\n\n\n \"Terrible? I think you're  wonderful!\"\n\n\n \"And you promise not to print  it?\"\n\n\n \"Didn't I say I wouldn't?\"\n\n\n \"Y-e-s. But you know, you're  a liar sometimes, Jerry. I've noticed  that about you.\" The press secretary's secretary,  a massive woman with  gray hair and impervious to  charm, guarded the portals of  his office with all the indomitable  will of the U. S. Marines.  But Jerry Bridges tried.\n\n\n \"You don't understand, Lana,\"  he said. \"I don't want to see Mr.  Howells. I just want you to give him something.\"\n\n\n \"My name's not Lana, and I can't deliver any messages.\"\n\n\n \"But this is something he wants to see.\" He handed her  an envelope, stamped URGENT.  \"Do it for me, Hedy. And I'll  buy you the flashiest pair of  diamond earrings in Washington.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" the woman said,  thawing slightly. \"I could deliver  it with his next batch of mail.\"\n\n\n \"When will that be?\"\n\n\n \"In an hour. He's in a terribly  important meeting right  now.\"\n\n\n \"You've got some mail right  there. Earrings and a bracelet  to match.\"\n\n\n She looked at him with exasperation,  and then gathered up  a stack of memorandums and  letters, his own envelope atop  it. She came out of the press  secretary's office two minutes  later with Howells himself, and  Howells said: \"You there,  Bridges. Come in here.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir !\" Jerry said, breezing  by the waiting reporters  with a grin of triumph.\n\n\n There were six men in the  room, three in military uniform.  Howells poked the envelope towards  Jerry, and snapped:\n\n\n \"This note of yours. Just what  do you think it means?\"\n\n\n \"You know better than I do,  Mr. Howells. I'm just doing my  job; I think the public has a  right to know about this spaceship  that's flying around\u2014\" His words brought an exclamation  from the others. Howells  sighed, and said:\n\n\n \"Mr. Bridges, you don't make  it easy for us. It's our opinion  that secrecy is essential, that  leakage of the story might cause  panic. Since you're the only unauthorized  person who knows of  it, we have two choices. One of  them is to lock you up.\"\n\n\n Jerry swallowed hard.\n\n\n \"The other is perhaps more  practical,\" Howells said. \"You'll  be taken into our confidence, and  allowed to accompany those officials  who will be admitted to the  landing site. But you will not be  allowed to relay the story to the  press until such a time as all correspondents are informed.  That won't give you a 'scoop' if  that's what you call it, but you'll  be an eyewitness. That should  be worth something.\"\n\n\n \"It's worth a lot,\" Jerry said  eagerly. \"Thanks, Mr. Howells.\"\n\n\n \"Don't thank me, I'm not doing  you any personal favor. Now  about the landing tonight\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You mean the spaceship's  coming down?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. A special foreign ministers  conference was held this  morning, and a decision was  reached to accept the delegate.  Landing instructions are being  given at Los Alamos, and the  ship will presumably land  around midnight tonight. There  will be a jet leaving Washington  Airport at nine, and you'll be  on it. Meanwhile, consider yourself  in custody.\" The USAF jet transport  wasn't the only secrecy-shrouded  aircraft that took off that evening  from Washington Airport.  But Jerry Bridges, sitting in  the rear seat flanked by two  Sphinx-like Secret Service men,  knew that he was the only passenger  with non-official status  aboard.\n\n\n It was only a few minutes  past ten when they arrived at  the air base at Los Alamos. The  desert sky was cloudy and starless,  and powerful searchlights  probed the thick cumulus. There  were sleek, purring black autos  waiting to rush the air passengers  to some unnamed destination.  They drove for twenty  minutes across a flat ribbon of  desert road, until Jerry sighted  what appeared to be a circle of  newly-erected lights in the middle  of nowhere. On the perimeter,  official vehicles were parked  in orderly rows, and four USAF  trailer trucks were in evidence,  their radarscopes turning slowly.  There was activity everywhere,  but it was well-ordered  and unhurried. They had done a  good job of keeping the excitement  contained.\n\n\n He was allowed to leave the  car and stroll unescorted. He  tried to talk to some of the  scurrying officials, but to no  avail. Finally, he contented  himself by sitting on the sand,  his back against the grill of a  staff car, smoking one cigarette  after another.\n\n\n As the minutes ticked off, the  activity became more frenetic  around him. Then the pace slowed,  and he knew the appointed  moment was approaching. Stillness  returned to the desert, and  tension was a tangible substance  in the night air.\n\n\n The radarscopes spun slowly.\n\n\n The searchlights converged  in an intricate pattern.\n\n\n Then the clouds seemed to  part!\n\n\n \"Here she comes!\" a voice  shouted. And in a moment, the  calm was shattered. At first, he  saw nothing. A faint roar was  started in the heavens, and it  became a growl that increased  in volume until even the shouting  voices could no longer be  heard. Then the crisscrossing  lights struck metal, glancing off  the gleaming body of a descending  object. Larger and larger  the object grew, until it assumed  the definable shape of a squat  silver funnel, falling in a perfect  straight line towards the center  of the light-ringed area. When it  hit, a dust cloud obscured it from  sight. A loudspeaker blared out an  unintelligible order, but its message  was clear. No one moved  from their position.\n\n\n Finally, a three-man team,  asbestos-clad, lead-shielded, stepped  out from the ring of spectators.  They carried geiger counters  on long poles before them.\n\n\n Jerry held his breath as they  approached the object; only  when they were yards away did  he appreciate its size. It wasn't  large; not more than fifteen feet  in total circumference.\n\n\n One of the three men waved  a gloved hand.\n\n\n \"It's okay,\" a voice breathed  behind him. \"No radiation ...\"\n\n\n Slowly, the ring of spectators  closed tighter. They were twenty  yards from the ship when the  voice spoke to them.\n\n\n \"Greetings from Venus,\" it  said, and then repeated the  phrase in six languages. \"The  ship you see is a Venusian Class  7 interplanetary rocket, built  for one-passenger. It is clear of  all radiation, and is perfectly  safe to approach. There is a  hatch which may be opened by  an automatic lever in the side.  Please open this hatch and remove  the passenger.\"\n\n\n An Air Force General whom  Jerry couldn't identify stepped  forward. He circled the ship  warily, and then said something  to the others. They came closer,  and he touched a small lever on  the silvery surface of the funnel.\n\n\n A door slid open.\n\n\n \"It's a box!\" someone said.\n\n\n \"A crate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Colligan! Moore! Schaffer!  Lend a hand here\u2014\"\n\n\n A trio came forward and  hoisted the crate out of the ship.  Then the voice spoke again;  Jerry deduced that it must have  been activated by the decreased  load of the ship.\n\n\n \"Please open the crate. You  will find our delegate within.  We trust you will treat him  with the courtesy of an official  emissary.\"\n\n\n They set to work on the crate,  its gray plastic material giving  in readily to the application of  their tools. But when it was  opened, they stood aside in  amazement and consternation.\n\n\n There were a variety of metal  pieces packed within, protected  by a filmy packing material.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute,\" the general  said. \"Here's a book\u2014\"\n\n\n He picked up a gray-bound  volume, and opened its cover.\n\n\n \"'Instructions for assembling  Delegate,'\" he read aloud.  \"'First, remove all parts and  arrange them in the following  order. A-1, central nervous system  housing. A-2 ...'\" He looked  up. \"It's an instruction book,\"  he whispered. \"We're supposed  to build the damn thing.\" The Delegate, a handsomely  constructed robot almost eight  feet tall, was pieced together  some three hours later, by a  team of scientists and engineers  who seemed to find the Venusian  instructions as elementary as a  blueprint in an Erector set. But  simple as the job was, they were  obviously impressed by the  mechanism they had assembled.  It stood impassive until they  obeyed the final instruction.  \"Press Button K ...\"\n\n\n They found button K, and  pressed it.\n\n\n The robot bowed.\n\n\n \"Thank you, gentlemen,\" it  said, in sweet, unmetallic accents.  \"Now if you will please  escort me to the meeting  place ...\" It wasn't until three days  after the landing that Jerry  Bridges saw the Delegate again.  Along with a dozen assorted  government officials, Army officers,  and scientists, he was  quartered in a quonset hut in  Fort Dix, New Jersey. Then,  after seventy-two frustrating  hours, he was escorted by Marine  guard into New York City.  No one told him his destination,  and it wasn't until he saw the  bright strips of light across the  face of the United Nations  building that he knew where the  meeting was to be held.\n\n\n But his greatest surprise was  yet to come. The vast auditorium  which housed the general  assembly was filled to its capacity,  but there were new faces  behind the plaques which designated  the member nations.  He couldn't believe his eyes at  first, but as the meeting got  under way, he knew that it was  true. The highest echelons of the  world's governments were represented,  even\u2014Jerry gulped  at the realization\u2014Nikita Khrushchev  himself. It was a summit  meeting such as he had never  dreamed possible, a summit  meeting without benefit of long  foreign minister's debate. And  the cause of it all, a placid,  highly-polished metal robot, was  seated blithely at a desk which  bore the designation: VENUS.\n\n\n The robot delegate stood up.\n\n\n \"Gentlemen,\" it said into the  microphone, and the great men  at the council tables strained to  hear the translator's version  through their headphones, \"Gentlemen,  I thank you for your  prompt attention. I come as a  Delegate from a great neighbor  planet, in the interests of peace  and progress for all the solar  system. I come in the belief that  peace is the responsibility of individuals,  of nations, and now  of worlds, and that each is dependent  upon the other. I speak  to you now through the electronic  instrumentation which  has been created for me, and I  come to offer your planet not  merely a threat, a promise, or  an easy solution\u2014but a challenge.\"\n\n\n The council room stirred.\n\n\n \"Your earth satellites have  been viewed with interest by the  astronomers of our world, and  we foresee the day when contact  between our planets will be commonplace.  As for ourselves, we  have hitherto had little desire  to explore beyond our realm,  being far too occupied with internal  matters. But our isolation  cannot last in the face of  your progress, so we believe that  we must take part in your  affairs.\n\n\n \"Here, then, is our challenge.  Continue your struggle of ideas,  compete with each other for the  minds of men, fight your bloodless  battles, if you know no  other means to attain progress.  But do all this without unleashing  the terrible forces of power  now at your command. Once  unleashed, these forces may or  may not destroy all that you  have gained. But we, the scientists  of Venus, promise you this\u2014that  on the very day your conflict  deteriorates into heedless  violence, we will not stand by  and let the ugly contagion  spread. On that day, we of  Venus will act swiftly, mercilessly,  and relentlessly\u2014to destroy  your world completely.\"\n\n\n Again, the meeting room exploded  in a babble of languages.\n\n\n \"The vessel which brought me  here came as a messenger of  peace. But envision it, men of  Earth, as a messenger of war.  Unstoppable, inexorable, it may  return, bearing a different Delegate  from Venus\u2014a Delegate of  Death, who speaks not in words,  but in the explosion of atoms.  Think of thousands of such Delegates,  fired from a vantage  point far beyond the reach of  your retaliation. This is the  promise and the challenge that  will hang in your night sky from  this moment forward. Look at  the planet Venus, men of Earth,  and see a Goddess of Vengeance,  poised to wreak its wrath upon  those who betray the peace.\"\n\n\n The Delegate sat down. Four days later, a mysterious  explosion rocked the quiet sands  of Los Alamos, and the Venus  spacecraft was no more. Two  hours after that, the robot delegate,  its message delivered, its  mission fulfilled, requested to be  locked inside a bombproof  chamber. When the door was  opened, the Delegate was an exploded  ruin.\n\n\n The news flashed with lightning  speed over the world, and  Jerry Bridges' eyewitness accounts  of the incredible event  was syndicated throughout the  nation. But his sudden celebrity  left him vaguely unsatisfied.\n\n\n He tried to explain his feeling  to Greta on his first night back  in Washington. They were in his  apartment, and it was the first  time Greta had consented to pay  him the visit.\n\n\n \"Well, what's bothering you?\"  Greta pouted. \"You've had the  biggest story of the year under  your byline. I should think you'd  be tickled pink.\"\n\n\n \"It's not that,\" Jerry said  moodily. \"But ever since I heard  the Delegate speak, something's  been nagging me.\"\n\n\n \"But don't you think he's done  good? Don't you think they'll be  impressed by what he said?\"\n\n\n \"I'm not worried about that.  I think that damn robot did  more for peace than anything  that's ever come along in this  cockeyed world. But still ...\"\n\n\n Greta snuggled up to him on  the sofa. \"You worry too much.  Don't you ever think of anything  else? You should learn to  relax. It can be fun.\"\n\n\n She started to prove it to him,  and Jerry responded the way a  normal, healthy male usually  does. But in the middle of an  embrace, he cried out:\n\n\n \"Wait a minute!\"\n\n\n \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\n \"I just thought of something!  Now where the hell did I put  my old notebooks?\"\n\n\n He got up from the sofa and  went scurrying to a closet. From  a debris of cardboard boxes, he  found a worn old leather brief  case, and cackled with delight  when he found the yellowed  notebooks inside.\n\n\n \"What are they?\" Greta said.\n\n\n \"My old school notebooks.  Greta, you'll have to excuse me.  But there's something I've got  to do, right away!\"\n\n\n \"That's all right with me,\"  Greta said haughtily. \"I know  when I'm not wanted.\"\n\n\n She took her hat and coat from  the hall closet, gave him one  last chance to change his mind,  and then left.\n\n\n Five minutes later, Jerry  Bridges was calling the airlines. It had been eleven years since  Jerry had walked across the  campus of Clifton University,  heading for the ivy-choked  main building. It was remarkable  how little had changed, but  the students seemed incredibly  young. He was winded by the  time he asked the pretty girl at  the desk where Professor Martin  Coltz could be located.\n\n\n \"Professor Coltz?\" She stuck  a pencil to her mouth. \"Well, I  guess he'd be in the Holland  Laboratory about now.\"\n\n\n \"Holland Laboratory? What's  that?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I guess that was after  your time, wasn't it?\"\n\n\n Jerry felt decrepit, but managed  to say: \"It must be something  new since I was here.  Where is this place?\"\n\n\n He followed her directions,  and located a fresh-painted  building three hundred yards  from the men's dorm. He met a  student at the door, who told  him that Professor Coltz would  be found in the physics department.\n\n\n The room was empty when  Jerry entered, except for the  single stooped figure vigorously  erasing a blackboard. He turned  when the door opened. If the  students looked younger, Professor  Coltz was far older than  Jerry remembered. He was a  tall man, with an unruly confusion  of straight gray hair. He  blinked when Jerry said:\n\n\n \"Hello, Professor. Do you remember  me? Jerry Bridges?\"\n\n\n \"Of course! I thought of you  only yesterday, when I saw your  name in the papers\u2014\"\n\n\n They sat at facing student  desks, and chatted about old  times. But Jerry was impatient  to get to the point of his visit,  and he blurted out:\n\n\n \"Professor Coltz, something's  been bothering me. It bothered  me from the moment I heard  the Delegate speak. I didn't  know what it was until last  night, when I dug out my old  college notebooks. Thank God  I kept them.\"\n\n\n Coltz's eyes were suddenly  hooded.\n\n\n \"What do you mean, Jerry?\"\n\n\n \"There was something about  the Robot's speech that sounded  familiar\u2014I could have sworn  I'd heard some of the words  before. I couldn't prove anything  until I checked my old  notes, and here's what I found.\"\n\n\n He dug into his coat pocket  and produced a sheet of paper.  He unfolded it and read aloud.\n\n\n \"'It's my belief that peace is  the responsibility of individuals,  of nations, and someday, even of  worlds ...' Sound familiar, Professor?\"\n\n\n Coltz shifted uncomfortably.  \"I don't recall every silly thing  I said, Jerry.\"\n\n\n \"But it's an interesting coincidence,  isn't it, Professor?  These very words were spoken  by the Delegate from Venus.\"\n\n\n \"A coincidence\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is it? But I also remember  your interest in robotics. I'll  never forget that mechanical  homing pigeon you constructed.  And you've probably learned  much more these past eleven  years.\"\n\n\n \"What are you driving at,  Jerry?\"\n\n\n \"Just this, Professor. I had a  little daydream, recently, and I  want you to hear it. I dreamed  about a group of teachers, scientists,  and engineers, a group  who were suddenly struck by  an exciting, incredible idea. A  group that worked in the quiet  and secrecy of a University on a  fantastic scheme to force the  idea of peace into the minds of  the world's big shots. Does my  dream interest you, Professor?\"\n\n\n \"Go on.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I dreamt that this  group would secretly launch an  earth satellite of their own, and  arrange for the nose cone to  come down safely at a certain  time and place. They would install  a marvelous electronic robot  within the cone, ready to be  assembled. They would beam a  radio message to earth from the  cone, seemingly as if it originated  from their 'spaceship.'  Then, when the Robot was assembled,  they would speak  through it to demand peace for  all mankind ...\"\n\n\n \"Jerry, if you do this\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You don't have to say it,  Professor, I know what you're  thinking. I'm a reporter, and my  business is to tell the world  everything I know. But if I  did it, there might not be a  world for me to write about,  would there? No, thanks, Professor.  As far as I'm concerned,  what I told you was nothing  more than a daydream.\" Jerry braked the convertible  to a halt, and put his arm  around Greta's shoulder. She  looked up at the star-filled night,  and sighed romantically.\n\n\n Jerry pointed. \"That one.\"\n\n\n Greta shivered closer to him.\n\n\n \"And to think what that terrible  planet can do to us!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I dunno. Venus is also  the Goddess of Love.\"\n\n\n He swung his other arm  around her, and Venus winked  approvingly.
