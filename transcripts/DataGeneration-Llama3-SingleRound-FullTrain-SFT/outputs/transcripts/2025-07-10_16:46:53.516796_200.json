      "background_text": "Letter\n\n of\n\n the\n\n Law by Alan E. Nourse The  place was dark and damp, and smelled like moldy leaves.  Meyerhoff followed the huge, bear-like Altairian guard  down the slippery flagstones of the corridor, sniffing the  dead, musty air with distaste. He drew his carefully tailored  Terran-styled jacket closer about his shoulders, shivering as his  eyes avoided the black, yawning cell-holes they were passing.  His foot slipped on the slimy flags from time to time, and  finally he paused to wipe the caked mud from his trouser leg.  \"How much farther is it?\" he shouted angrily.\n\n\n The guard waved a heavy paw vaguely into the blackness  ahead. Quite suddenly the corridor took a sharp bend, and the  Altairian stopped, producing a huge key ring from some obscure  fold of his hairy hide. \"I still don't see any reason for  all the fuss,\" he grumbled in a wounded tone. \"We've treated  him like a brother.\"\n\n\n One of the huge steel doors clicked open. Meyerhoff peered  into the blackness, catching a vaguely human outline against  the back wall. \"Harry?\" he called sharply.\n\n\n There was a startled gasp from within, and a skinny, gnarled  little man suddenly appeared in the guard's light, like a grotesque,  twisted ghost out of the blackness. Wide blue eyes  regarded Meyerhoff from beneath uneven black eyebrows, and  then the little man's face broke into a crafty grin. \"Paul! So  they sent you ! I knew I could count on it!\" He executed a  deep, awkward bow, motioning Meyerhoff into the dark  cubicle. \"Not much to offer you,\" he said slyly, \"but it's the  best I can do under the circumstances.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff scowled, and turned abruptly to the guard. \"We'll  have some privacy now, if you please. Interplanetary ruling.  And leave us the light.\"\n\n\n The guard grumbled, and started for the door. \"It's about  time you showed up!\" cried the little man in the cell. \"Great  day! Lucky they sent you, pal. Why, I've been in here for  years\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Zeckler, the name is Meyerhoff, and I'm not your  pal,\" Meyerhoff snapped. \"And you've been here for two  weeks, three days, and approximately four hours. You're getting  as bad as your gentle guards when it comes to bandying  the truth around.\" He peered through the dim light at the  gaunt face of the prisoner. Zeckler's face was dark with a  week's beard, and his bloodshot eyes belied the cocky grin  on his lips. His clothes were smeared and sodden, streaked  with great splotches of mud and moss. Meyerhoff's face softened  a little. \"So Harry Zeckler's in a jam again,\" he said.  \"You look as if they'd treated you like a brother.\"\n\n\n The little man snorted. \"These overgrown teddy-bears don't  know what brotherhood means, nor humanity, either. Bread  and water I've been getting, nothing more, and then only if they  feel like bringing it down.\" He sank wearily down on the rock  bench along the wall. \"I thought you'd never get here! I sent  an appeal to the Terran Consulate the first day I was arrested.  What happened? I mean, all they had to do was get a man  over here, get the extradition papers signed, and provide transportation  off the planet for me. Why so much time? I've been  sitting here rotting\u2014\" He broke off in mid-sentence and stared  at Meyerhoff. \"You brought the papers, didn't you? I mean,  we can leave now?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff stared at the little man with a mixture of pity and  disgust. \"You are a prize fool,\" he said finally. \"Did you know  that?\"\n\n\n Zeckler's eyes widened. \"What do you mean, fool? So I  spend a couple of weeks in this pneumonia trap. The deal was  worth it! I've got three million credits sitting in the Terran  Consulate on Altair V, just waiting for me to walk in and pick  them up. Three million credits\u2014do you hear? That's enough  to set me up for life!\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff nodded grimly. \" If you live long enough to walk  in and pick them up, that is.\"\n\n\n \"What do you mean, if?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff sank down beside the man, his voice a tense  whisper in the musty cell. \"I mean that right now you are  practically dead. You may not know it, but you are. You walk  into a newly opened planet with your smart little bag of tricks,  walk in here with a shaky passport and no permit, with no  knowledge of the natives outside of two paragraphs of inaccuracies  in the Explorer's Guide, and even then you're not  content to come in and sell something legitimate, something  the natives might conceivably be able to use. No, nothing so  simple for you. You have to pull your usual high-pressure stuff.  And this time, buddy, you're paying the piper.\"\n\n\n \" You mean I'm not being extradited? \"\n\n\n Meyerhoff grinned unpleasantly. \"I mean precisely that.  You've committed a crime here\u2014a major crime. The Altairians  are sore about it. And the Terran Consulate isn't willing  to sell all the trading possibilities here down the river just to  get you out of a mess. You're going to stand trial\u2014and these  natives are out to get you. Personally, I think they're going to get you.\"\n\n\n Zeckler stood up shakily. \"You can't believe anything the  natives say,\" he said uneasily. \"They're pathological liars.  Why, you should see what they tried to sell me ! You've never  seen such a pack of liars as these critters.\" He glanced up at  Meyerhoff. \"They'll probably drop a little fine on me and let  me go.\"\n\n\n \"A little fine of one Terran neck.\" Meyerhoff grinned nastily.  \"You've committed the most heinous crime these creatures can  imagine, and they're going to get you for it if it's the last thing  they do. I'm afraid, my friend, that your con-man days are  over.\"\n\n\n Zeckler fished in the other man's pocket, extracted a cigarette,  and lighted it with trembling fingers. \"It's bad, then,\"  he said finally.\n\n\n \"It's bad, all right.\"\n\n\n Some shadow of the sly, elfin grin crept over the little con-man's  face. \"Well, at any rate, I'm glad they sent you over,\"  he said weakly. \"Nothing like a good lawyer to handle a trial.\"\n\n\n \" Lawyer? Not me! Oh, no. Sorry, but no thanks.\" Meyerhoff  chuckled. \"I'm your advisor, old boy. Nothing else. I'm here  to keep you from botching things up still worse for the Trading  Commission, that's all. I wouldn't get tangled up in a mess  with those creatures for anything!\" He shook his head. \"You're  your own lawyer, Mr. Super-salesman. It's all your show. And  you'd better get your head out of the sand, or you're going to  lose a case like it's never been lost before!\" Meyerhoff watched the man's pale face, and shook his head.  In a way, he thought, it was a pity to see such a change in the  rosy-cheeked, dapper, cocksure little man who had talked his  way glibly in and out of more jams than Meyerhoff could  count. Trading brought scalpers; it was almost inevitable that  where rich and unexploited trading ground was uncovered, it  would first fall prey to the fast-trading boys. They spread out  from Terra with the first wave of exploration\u2014the slick, fast-talking  con-men who could work new territories unfettered by  the legal restrictions that soon closed down the more established  planets. The first men in were the richest out, and  through some curious quirk of the Terrestrial mind, they knew  they could count on Terran protection, however crooked and  underhand their methods.\n\n\n But occasionally a situation arose where the civilization and  social practices of the alien victims made it unwise to tamper  with them. Altair I had been recognized at once by the Trading  Commission as a commercial prize of tremendous value, but  early reports had warned of the danger of wildcat trading on  the little, musty, jungle-like planet with its shaggy, three-eyed  inhabitants\u2014warned specifically against the confidence tactics  so frequently used\u2014but there was always somebody, Meyerhoff  reflected sourly, who just didn't get the word.\n\n\n Zeckler puffed nervously on his cigarette, his narrow face  a study in troubled concentration. \"But I didn't do anything!\"  he exploded finally. \"So I pulled an old con game. So what?  Why should they get so excited? So I clipped a few thousand  credits, pulled a little fast business.\" He shrugged eloquently,  spreading his hands. \"Everybody's doing it. They do it to each  other without batting an eye. You should see these critters  operate on each other. Why, my little scheme was peanuts by  comparison.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff pulled a pipe from his pocket, and began stuffing  the bowl with infinite patience. \"And precisely what sort of  con game was it?\" he asked quietly.\n\n\n Zeckler shrugged again. \"The simplest, tiredest, moldiest  old racket that ever made a quick nickel. Remember the old  Terran gag about the Brooklyn Bridge? The same thing. Only  these critters didn't want bridges. They wanted land\u2014this  gooey, slimy swamp they call 'farm land.' So I gave them  what they wanted. I just sold them some land.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff nodded fiercely. \"You sure did. A hundred square  kilos at a swipe. Only you sold the same hundred square kilos  to a dozen different natives.\" Suddenly he threw back his hands  and roared. \"Of all the things you shouldn't have done\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But what's a chunk of land?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff shook his head hopelessly. \"If you hadn't been  so greedy, you'd have found out what a chunk of land was to  these natives before you started peddling it. You'd have found  out other things about them, too. You'd have learned that  in spite of all their bumbling and fussing and squabbling  they're not so dull. You'd have found out that they're marsupials,  and that two out of five of them get thrown out of  their mother's pouch before they're old enough to survive.  You'd have realized that they have to start fighting for individual  rights almost as soon as they're born. Anything goes,  as long as it benefits them as individuals.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff grinned at the little man's horrified face. \"Never  heard of that, had you? And you've never heard of other things,  too. You've probably never heard that there are just too many  Altairians here for the food their planet can supply, and their  diet is so finicky that they just can't live on anything that  doesn't grow here. And consequently, land is the key factor  in their economy, not money; nothing but land. To get land,  it's every man for himself, and the loser starves, and their  entire legal and monetary system revolves on that principle.  They've built up the most confusing and impossible system of  barter and trade imaginable, aimed at individual survival, with  land as the value behind the credit. That explains the lying\u2014of  course they're liars, with an economy like that. They've  completely missed the concept of truth. Pathological? You bet  they're pathological! Only a fool would tell the truth when his  life depended on his being a better liar than the next guy!  Lying is the time-honored tradition, with their entire legal  system built around it.\"\n\n\n Zeckler snorted. \"But how could they possibly have a legal  system? I mean, if they don't recognize the truth when it slaps  them in the face?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff shrugged. \"As we understand legal systems, I  suppose they don't have one. They have only the haziest idea  what truth represents, and they've shrugged off the idea as  impossible and useless.\" He chuckled maliciously. \"So you  went out and found a chunk of ground in the uplands, and  sold it to a dozen separate, self-centered, half-starved natives!  Encroachment on private property is legal grounds for murder  on this planet, and twelve of them descended on the same  chunk of land at the same time, all armed with title-deeds.\"  Meyerhoff sighed. \"You've got twelve mad Altairians in your  hair. You've got a mad planet in your hair. And in the meantime,  Terra's most valuable uranium source in five centuries  is threatening to cut off supply unless they see your blood  splattered liberally all the way from here to the equator.\"\n\n\n Zeckler was visibly shaken. \"Look,\" he said weakly, \"so I  wasn't so smart. What am I going to do? I mean, are you  going to sit quietly by and let them butcher me? How could  I defend myself in a legal setup like this ?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff smiled coolly. \"You're going to get your sly little  con-man brain to working, I think,\" he said softly. \"By Interplanetary  Rules, they have to give you a trial in Terran legal  form\u2014judge, jury, court procedure, all that folderol. They  think it's a big joke\u2014after all, what could a judicial oath mean  to them?\u2014but they agreed. Only thing is, they're going to  hang you, if they die trying. So you'd better get those stunted  little wits of yours clicking\u2014and if you try to implicate me ,  even a little bit, I'll be out of there so fast you won't know  what happened.\"\n\n\n With that Meyerhoff walked to the door. He jerked it inward  sharply, and spilled two guards over on their faces.  \"Privacy,\" he grunted, and started back up the slippery corridor. It certainly looked like a courtroom, at any rate. In the front  of the long, damp stone room was a bench, with a seat behind  it, and a small straight chair to the right. To the left was a stand  with twelve chairs\u2014larger chairs, with a railing running along  the front. The rest of the room was filled almost to the door  with seats facing the bench. Zeckler followed the shaggy-haired  guard into the room, nodding approvingly. \"Not such a bad  arrangement,\" he said. \"They must have gotten the idea fast.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff wiped the perspiration from his forehead, and  shot the little con-man a stony glance. \"At least you've got  a courtroom, a judge, and a jury for this mess. Beyond that\u2014\"  He shrugged eloquently. \"I can't make any promises.\"\n\n\n In the back of the room a door burst open with a bang.  Loud, harsh voices were heard as half a dozen of the huge  Altairians attempted to push through the door at once. Zeckler  clamped on the headset to his translator unit, and watched the  hubbub in the anteroom with growing alarm. Finally the question  of precedent seemed to be settled, and a group of the  Altairians filed in, in order of stature, stalking across the room  in flowing black robes, pug-nosed faces glowering with self-importance.  They descended upon the jury box, grunting and  scrapping with each other for the first-row seats, and the judge  took his place with obvious satisfaction behind the heavy  wooden bench. Finally, the prosecuting attorney appeared,  flanked by two clerks, who took their places beside him. The  prosecutor eyed Zeckler with cold malevolence, then turned  and delivered a sly wink at the judge.\n\n\n In a moment the room was a hubbub as it filled with the  huge, bumbling, bear-like creatures, jostling each other and  fighting for seats, growling and complaining. Two small fights  broke out in the rear, but were quickly subdued by the group  of gendarmes guarding the entrance. Finally the judge glared  down at Zeckler with all three eyes, and pounded the bench top  with a wooden mallet until the roar of activity subsided. The  jurymen wriggled uncomfortably in their seats, exchanging  winks, and finally turned their attention to the front of the  court.\n\n\n \"We are reading the case of the people of Altair I,\" the  judge's voice roared out, \"against one Harry Zeckler\u2014\" he  paused for a long, impressive moment\u2014\"Terran.\" The courtroom  immediately burst into an angry growl, until the judge  pounded the bench five or six times more. \"This\u2014creature\u2014is  hereby accused of the following crimes,\" the judge bellowed.  \"Conspiracy to overthrow the government of Altair I. Brutal  murder of seventeen law-abiding citizens of the village of  Karzan at the third hour before dawn in the second period  after his arrival. Desecration of the Temple of our beloved  Goddess Zermat, Queen of the Harvest. Conspiracy with the  lesser gods to cause the unprecedented drought in the Dermatti  section of our fair globe. Obscene exposure of his pouch-marks  in a public square. Four separate and distinct charges of jail-break  and bribery\u2014\" The judge pounded the bench for order\u2014\"Espionage  with the accursed scum of Altair II in preparation  for interplanetary invasion.\"\n\n\n The little con-man's jaw sagged lower and lower, the color  draining from his face. He turned, wide-eyed, to Meyerhoff,  then back to the judge.\n\n\n \"The Chairman of the Jury,\" said the Judge succinctly, \"will  read the verdict.\"\n\n\n The little native in the front of the jury-box popped up like  a puppet on a string. \"Defendant found guilty on all counts,\"  he said.\n\n\n \"Defendant is guilty! The court will pronounce sentence\u2014\"\n\n\n \" Now wait a minute! \" Zeckler was on his feet, wild-eyed.  \"What kind of railroad job\u2014\"\n\n\n The judge blinked disappointedly at Paul Meyerhoff. \"Not  yet?\" he asked, unhappily.\n\n\n \"No.\" Meyerhoff's hands twitched nervously. \"Not yet, Your  Honor. Later, Your Honor. The trial comes first .\"\n\n\n The judge looked as if his candy had been stolen. \"But you said I should call for the verdict.\"\n\n\n \"Later. You have to have the trial before you can have the  verdict.\"\n\n\n The Altairian shrugged indifferently. \"Now\u2014later\u2014\" he  muttered.\n\n\n \"Have the prosecutor call his first witness,\" said Meyerhoff.\n\n\n Zeckler leaned over, his face ashen. \"These charges,\" he  whispered. \"They're insane!\"\n\n\n \"Of course they are,\" Meyerhoff whispered back.\n\n\n \"But what am I going to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit tight. Let them set things up.\"\n\n\n \"But those lies . They're liars, the whole pack of them\u2014\" He  broke off as the prosecutor roared a name.\n\n\n The shaggy brute who took the stand was wearing a bright  purple hat which sat rakishly over one ear. He grinned the  Altairian equivalent of a hungry grin at the prosecutor. Then  he cleared his throat and started. \"This Terran riffraff\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The oath,\" muttered the judge. \"We've got to have the  oath.\"\n\n\n The prosecutor nodded, and four natives moved forward,  carrying huge inscribed marble slabs to the front of the court.  One by one the chunks were reverently piled in a heap at the  witness's feet. The witness placed a huge, hairy paw on the  cairn, and the prosecutor said, \"Do you swear to tell the truth,  the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you\u2014\" he  paused to squint at the paper in his hand, and finished on a  puzzled note, \"\u2014Goddess?\"\n\n\n The witness removed the paw from the rock pile long enough  to scratch his ear. Then he replaced it, and replied, \"Of course,\"  in an injured tone.\n\n\n \"Then tell this court what you have seen of the activities of  this abominable wretch.\"\n\n\n The witness settled back into the chair, fixing one eye on  Zeckler's face, another on the prosecutor, and closing the third  as if in meditation. \"I think it happened on the fourth night  of the seventh crossing of Altair II (may the Goddess cast  a drought upon it)\u2014or was it the seventh night of the fourth  crossing?\u2014\" he grinned apologetically at the judge\u2014\"when I  was making my way back through town toward my blessed  land-plot, minding my own business, Your Honor, after weeks  of bargaining for the crop I was harvesting. Suddenly from the  shadow of the building, this creature\u2014\" he waved a paw at  Zeckler\u2014\"stopped me in my tracks with a vicious cry. He had  a weapon I'd never seen before, and before I could find my  voice he forced me back against the wall. I could see by the  cruel glint in his eyes that there was no warmth, no sympathy  in his heart, that I was\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Objection!\" Zeckler squealed plaintively, jumping to his  feet. \"This witness can't even remember what night he's talking  about!\"\n\n\n The judge looked startled. Then he pawed feverishly through  his bundle of notes. \"Overruled,\" he said abruptly. \"Continue,  please.\"\n\n\n The witness glowered at Zeckler. \"As I was saying before  this loutish interruption,\" he muttered, \"I could see that I was  face to face with the most desperate of criminal types, even  for Terrans. Note the shape of his head, the flabbiness of his  ears. I was petrified with fear. And then, helpless as I was, this  two-legged abomination began to shower me with threats of  evil to my blessed home, dark threats of poisoning my land  unless I would tell him where he could find the resting place  of our blessed Goddess\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I never saw him before in my life,\" Zeckler moaned to  Meyerhoff. \"Listen to him! Why should I care where their  Goddess\u2014\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff gave him a stony look. \"The Goddess runs things  around here. She makes it rain. If it doesn't rain, somebody's  insulted her. It's very simple.\"\n\n\n \"But how can I fight testimony like that?\"\n\n\n \"I doubt if you can fight it.\"\n\n\n \"But they can't prove a word of it\u2014\" He looked at the jury,  who were listening enraptured to the second witness on the  stand. This one was testifying regarding the butcherous slaughter  of eighteen (or was it twenty-three? Oh, yes, twenty-three)  women and children in the suburban village of Karzan. The  pogrom, it seemed, had been accomplished by an energy  weapon which ate great, gaping holes in the sides of buildings.  A third witness took the stand, continuing the drone as the  room grew hotter and muggier. Zeckler grew paler and paler,  his eyes turning glassy as the testimony piled up. \"But it's not true ,\" he whispered to Meyerhoff.\n\n\n \"Of course it isn't! Can't you understand? These people  have no regard for truth. It's stupid, to them, silly, a mark of  low intelligence. The only thing in the world they have any  respect for is a liar bigger and more skillful than they are.\"\n\n\n Zeckler jerked around abruptly as he heard his name bellowed  out. \"Does the defendant have anything to say before  the jury delivers the verdict?\"\n\n\n \"Do I have\u2014\" Zeckler was across the room in a flash, his  pale cheeks suddenly taking on a feverish glow. He sat down  gingerly on the witness chair, facing the judge, his eyes bright  with fear and excitement. \"Your\u2014Your Honor, I\u2014I have a  statement to make which will have a most important bearing  on this case. You must listen with the greatest care.\" He  glanced quickly at Meyerhoff, and back to the judge. \"Your  Honor,\" he said in a hushed voice. \"You are in gravest of  danger. All of you. Your lives\u2014your very land is at stake.\"\n\n\n The judge blinked, and shuffled through his notes hurriedly  as a murmur arose in the court. \"Our land?\"\n\n\n \"Your lives, your land, everything you hold dear,\" Zeckler  said quickly, licking his lips nervously. \"You must try to  understand me\u2014\" he glanced apprehensively over his shoulder  \"now, because I may not live long enough to repeat what  I am about to tell you\u2014\"\n\n\n The murmur quieted down, all ears straining in their headsets  to hear his words. \"These charges,\" he continued, \"all of  them\u2014they're perfectly true. At least, they seem to be perfectly  true. But in every instance, I was working with heart and  soul, risking my life, for the welfare of your beautiful planet.\"\n\n\n There was a loud hiss from the back of the court. Zeckler  frowned and rubbed his hands together. \"It was my misfortune,\"  he said, \"to go to the wrong planet when I first came to  Altair from my homeland on Terra. I\u2014I landed on Altair II,  a grave mistake, but as it turned out, a very fortunate error.  Because in attempting to arrange trading in that frightful place,  I made certain contacts.\" His voice trembled, and sank lower.  \"I learned the horrible thing which is about to happen to this  planet, at the hands of those barbarians. The conspiracy is  theirs, not mine. They have bribed your Goddess, flattered her  and lied to her, coerced her all-powerful goodness to their own  evil interests, preparing for the day when they could persuade  her to cast your land into the fiery furnace of a ten-year-drought\u2014\"\n\n\n Somebody in the middle of the court burst out laughing.  One by one the natives nudged one another, and booed, and  guffawed, until the rising tide of racket drowned out Zeckler's  words. \"The defendant is obviously lying,\" roared the prosecutor  over the pandemonium. \"Any fool knows that the Goddess  can't be bribed. How could she be a Goddess if she could?\"\n\n\n Zeckler grew paler. \"But\u2014perhaps they were very clever\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And how could they flatter her, when she knows, beyond  doubt, that she is the most exquisitely radiant creature in all  the Universe? And you dare to insult her, drag her name in  the dirt.\"\n\n\n The hisses grew louder, more belligerent. Cries of \"Butcher  him!\" and \"Scald his bowels!\" rose from the courtroom. The  judge banged for silence, his eyes angry.\n\n\n \"Unless the defendant wishes to take up more of our precious  time with these ridiculous lies, the jury\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Wait! Your Honor, I request a short recess before I present  my final plea.\"\n\n\n \"Recess?\"\n\n\n \"A few moments to collect my thoughts, to arrange my  case.\"\n\n\n The judge settled back with a disgusted snarl. \"Do I have  to?\" he asked Meyerhoff.\n\n\n Meyerhoff nodded. The judge shrugged, pointing over his  shoulder to the anteroom. \"You can go in there,\" he said.\n\n\n Somehow, Zeckler managed to stumble from the witness  stand, amid riotous boos and hisses, and tottered into the anteroom. Zeckler puffed hungrily on a cigarette, and looked up at  Meyerhoff with haunted eyes. \"It\u2014it doesn't look so good,\"  he muttered.\n\n\n Meyerhoff's eyes were worried, too. For some reason, he  felt a surge of pity and admiration for the haggard con-man.  \"It's worse than I'd anticipated,\" he admitted glumly. \"That  was a good try, but you just don't know enough about them  and their Goddess.\" He sat down wearily. \"I don't see what  you can do. They want your blood, and they're going to have  it. They just won't believe you, no matter how big a lie you  tell.\"\n\n\n Zeckler sat in silence for a moment. \"This lying business,\"  he said finally, \"exactly how does it work?\"\n\n\n \"The biggest, most convincing liar wins. It's as simple as  that. It doesn't matter how outlandish a whopper you tell.  Unless, of course, they've made up their minds that you just  naturally aren't as big a liar as they are. And it looks like that's  just what they've done. It wouldn't make any difference to  them what you say\u2014unless, somehow, you could make them  believe it.\"\n\n\n Zeckler frowned. \"And how do they regard the\u2014the biggest  liar? I mean, how do they feel toward him?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff shifted uneasily. \"It's hard to say. It's been my  experience that they respect him highly\u2014maybe even fear him  a little. After all, the most convincing liar always wins in any  transaction, so he gets more land, more food, more power.  Yes, I think the biggest liar could go where he pleased without  any interference.\"\n\n\n Zeckler was on his feet, his eyes suddenly bright with excitement.  \"Wait a minute,\" he said tensely. \"To tell them a lie  that they'd have to believe\u2014a lie they simply couldn't help but believe\u2014\" He turned on Meyerhoff, his hands trembling.  \"Do they think the way we do? I mean, with logic, cause and  effect, examining evidence and drawing conclusions? Given  certain evidence, would they have to draw the same conclusions  that we have to draw?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff blinked. \"Well\u2014yes. Oh, yes, they're perfectly  logical.\"\n\n\n Zeckler's eyes flashed, and a huge grin broke out on his  sallow face. His thin body fairly shook. He started hopping  up and down on one foot, staring idiotically into space. \"If I  could only think\u2014\" he muttered. \"Somebody\u2014somewhere\u2014something  I read.\"\n\n\n \"Whatever are you talking about?\"\n\n\n \"It was a Greek, I think\u2014\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff stared at him. \"Oh, come now. Have you gone  off your rocker completely? You've got a problem on your  hands, man.\"\n\n\n \"No, no, I've got a problem in the bag!\" Zeckler's cheeks  flushed. \"Let's go back in there\u2014I think I've got an answer!\"\n\n\n The courtroom quieted the moment they opened the door,  and the judge banged the gavel for silence. As soon as Zeckler  had taken his seat on the witness stand, the judge turned to  the head juryman. \"Now, then,\" he said with happy finality.  \"The jury\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold on! Just one minute more.\"\n\n\n The judge stared down at Zeckler as if he were a bug on a  rock. \"Oh, yes. You had something else to say. Well, go ahead  and say it.\"\n\n\n Zeckler looked sharply around the hushed room. \"You want  to convict me,\" he said softly, \"in the worst sort of way. Isn't  that right?\"\n\n\n Eyes swung toward him. The judge broke into an evil grin.  \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"But you can't really convict me until you've considered  carefully any statement I make in my own defense. Isn't that  right?\"\n\n\n The judge looked uncomfortable. \"If you've got something  to say, go ahead and say it.\"\n\n\n \"I've got just one statement to make. Short and sweet. But  you'd better listen to it, and think it out carefully before you  decide that you really want to convict me.\" He paused, and  glanced slyly at the judge. \"You don't think much of those  who tell the truth, it seems. Well, put this statement in your  record, then.\" His voice was loud and clear in the still room.  \" All Earthmen are absolutely incapable of telling the truth. \"\n\n\n Puzzled frowns appeared on the jury's faces. One or two  exchanged startled glances, and the room was still as death.  The judge stared at him, and then at Meyerhoff, then back.  \"But you\"\u2014he stammered. \"You're\"\u2014He stopped in mid-sentence,  his jaw sagging.\n\n\n One of the jurymen let out a little squeak, and fainted dead  away. It took, all in all, about ten seconds for the statement  to soak in.\n\n\n And then pandemonium broke loose in the courtroom. \"Really,\" said Harry Zeckler loftily, \"it was so obvious I'm  amazed that it didn't occur to me first thing.\" He settled himself  down comfortably in the control cabin of the Interplanetary  Rocket and grinned at the outline of Altair IV looming larger  in the view screen.\n\n\n Paul Meyerhoff stared stonily at the controls, his lips compressed  angrily. \"You might at least have told me what you  were planning.\"\n\n\n \"And take the chance of being overheard? Don't be silly.  It had to come as a bombshell. I had to establish myself as a  liar\u2014the prize liar of them all, but I had to tell the sort of lie  that they simply could not cope with. Something that would  throw them into such utter confusion that they wouldn't dare convict me.\" He grinned impishly at Meyerhoff. \"The paradox  of Epimenides the Cretan. It really stopped them cold. They knew I was an Earthmen, which meant that my statement that  Earthmen were liars was a lie, which meant that maybe I wasn't  a liar, in which case\u2014oh, it was tailor-made.\"\n\n\n \"It sure was.\" Meyerhoff's voice was a snarl.\n\n\n \"Well, it made me out a liar in a class they couldn't approach,  didn't it?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff's face was purple with anger. \"Oh, indeed it did!  And it put all Earthmen in exactly the same class, too.\"\n\n\n \"So what's honor among thieves? I got off, didn't I?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff turned on him fiercely. \"Oh, you got off just fine.  You scared the living daylights out of them. And in an eon of  lying they never have run up against a short-circuit like that.  You've also completely botched any hope of ever setting up  a trading alliance with Altair I, and that includes uranium, too.  Smart people don't gamble with loaded dice. You scared them  so badly they don't want anything to do with us.\"\n\n\n Zeckler's grin broadened, and he leaned back luxuriously.  \"Ah, well. After all, the Trading Alliance was your outlook,  wasn't it? What a pity!\" He clucked his tongue sadly. \"Me,  I've got a fortune in credits sitting back at the consulate waiting  for me\u2014enough to keep me on silk for quite a while, I  might say. I think I'll just take a nice, long vacation.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff turned to him, and a twinkle of malignant glee  appeared in his eyes. \"Yes, I think you will. I'm quite sure of  it, in fact. Won't cost you a cent, either.\"\n\n\n \"Eh?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff grinned unpleasantly. He brushed an imaginary  lint fleck from his lapel, and looked up at Zeckler slyly. \"That\u2014uh\u2014jury  trial. The Altairians weren't any too happy to  oblige. They wanted to execute you outright. Thought a trial  was awfully silly\u2014until they got their money back, of course.  Not too much\u2014just three million credits.\"\n\n\n Zeckler went white. \"But that money was in banking custody!\"\n\n\n \"Is that right? My goodness. You don't suppose they could  have lost those papers, do you?\" Meyerhoff grinned at the  little con-man. \"And incidentally, you're under arrest, you  know.\"\n\n\n A choking sound came from Zeckler's throat. \" Arrest! \"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. Didn't I tell you? Conspiring to undermine the  authority of the Terran Trading Commission. Serious charge,  you know. Yes, I think we'll take a nice long vacation together,  straight back to Terra. And there I think you'll face a jury  trial.\"\n\n\n Zeckler spluttered. \"There's no evidence\u2014you've got nothing  on me! What kind of a frame are you trying to pull?\"\n\n\n \"A lovely frame. Airtight. A frame from the bottom up, and  you're right square in the middle. And this time\u2014\" Meyerhoff  tapped a cigarette on his thumb with happy finality\u2014\"this time  I don't think you'll get off.\" Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from \"Tiger by the Tail and Other Science Fiction  Stories by Alan E.

Nourse The  place was dark and damp, and smelled like moldy leaves.  Meyerhoff followed the huge, bear-like Altairian guard  down the slippery flagstones of the corridor, sniffing the  dead, musty air with distaste. He drew his carefully tailored  Terran-styled jacket closer about his shoulders, shivering as his  eyes avoided the black, yawning cell-holes they were passing.  His foot slipped on the slimy flags from time to time, and  finally he paused to wipe the caked mud from his trouser leg.  \"How much farther is it?\" he shouted angrily.\n\n\n The guard waved a heavy paw vaguely into the blackness  ahead. Quite suddenly the corridor took a sharp bend, and the  Altairian stopped, producing a huge key ring from some obscure  fold of his hairy hide. \"I still don't see any reason for  all the fuss,\" he grumbled in a wounded tone. \"We've treated  him like a brother.\"\n\n\n One of the huge steel doors clicked open. Meyerhoff peered  into the blackness, catching a vaguely human outline against  the back wall. \"Harry?\" he called sharply.\n\n\n There was a startled gasp from within, and a skinny, gnarled  little man suddenly appeared in the guard's light, like a grotesque,  twisted ghost out of the blackness. Wide blue eyes  regarded Meyerhoff from beneath uneven black eyebrows, and  then the little man's face broke into a crafty grin. \"Paul! So  they sent you ! I knew I could count on it!\" He executed a  deep, awkward bow, motioning Meyerhoff into the dark  cubicle. \"Not much to offer you,\" he said slyly, \"but it's the  best I can do under the circumstances.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff scowled, and turned abruptly to the guard. \"We'll  have some privacy now, if you please. Interplanetary ruling.  And leave us the light.\"\n\n\n The guard grumbled, and started for the door. \"It's about  time you showed up!\" cried the little man in the cell. \"Great  day! Lucky they sent you, pal. Why, I've been in here for  years\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Zeckler, the name is Meyerhoff, and I'm not your  pal,\" Meyerhoff snapped. \"And you've been here for two  weeks, three days, and approximately four hours. You're getting  as bad as your gentle guards when it comes to bandying  the truth around.\" He peered through the dim light at the  gaunt face of the prisoner. Zeckler's face was dark with a  week's beard, and his bloodshot eyes belied the cocky grin  on his lips. His clothes were smeared and sodden, streaked  with great splotches of mud and moss. Meyerhoff's face softened  a little. \"So Harry Zeckler's in a jam again,\" he said.  \"You look as if they'd treated you like a brother.\"\n\n\n The little man snorted. \"These overgrown teddy-bears don't  know what brotherhood means, nor humanity, either. Bread  and water I've been getting, nothing more, and then only if they  feel like bringing it down.\" He sank wearily down on the rock  bench along the wall. \"I thought you'd never get here! I sent  an appeal to the Terran Consulate the first day I was arrested.  What happened? I mean, all they had to do was get a man  over here, get the extradition papers signed, and provide transportation  off the planet for me. Why so much time? I've been  sitting here rotting\u2014\" He broke off in mid-sentence and stared  at Meyerhoff. \"You brought the papers, didn't you? I mean,  we can leave now?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff stared at the little man with a mixture of pity and  disgust. \"You are a prize fool,\" he said finally. \"Did you know  that?\"\n\n\n Zeckler's eyes widened. \"What do you mean, fool? So I  spend a couple of weeks in this pneumonia trap. The deal was  worth it! I've got three million credits sitting in the Terran  Consulate on Altair V, just waiting for me to walk in and pick  them up. Three million credits\u2014do you hear? That's enough  to set me up for life!\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff nodded grimly. \" If you live long enough to walk  in and pick them up, that is.\"\n\n\n \"What do you mean, if?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff sank down beside the man, his voice a tense  whisper in the musty cell. \"I mean that right now you are  practically dead. You may not know it, but you are. You walk  into a newly opened planet with your smart little bag of tricks,  walk in here with a shaky passport and no permit, with no  knowledge of the natives outside of two paragraphs of inaccuracies  in the Explorer's Guide, and even then you're not  content to come in and sell something legitimate, something  the natives might conceivably be able to use. No, nothing so  simple for you. You have to pull your usual high-pressure stuff.  And this time, buddy, you're paying the piper.\"\n\n\n \" You mean I'm not being extradited? \"\n\n\n Meyerhoff grinned unpleasantly. \"I mean precisely that.  You've committed a crime here\u2014a major crime. The Altairians  are sore about it. And the Terran Consulate isn't willing  to sell all the trading possibilities here down the river just to  get you out of a mess. You're going to stand trial\u2014and these  natives are out to get you. Personally, I think they're going to get you.\"\n\n\n Zeckler stood up shakily. \"You can't believe anything the  natives say,\" he said uneasily. \"They're pathological liars.  Why, you should see what they tried to sell me ! You've never  seen such a pack of liars as these critters.\" He glanced up at  Meyerhoff. \"They'll probably drop a little fine on me and let  me go.\"\n\n\n \"A little fine of one Terran neck.\" Meyerhoff grinned nastily.  \"You've committed the most heinous crime these creatures can  imagine, and they're going to get you for it if it's the last thing  they do. I'm afraid, my friend, that your con-man days are  over.\"\n\n\n Zeckler fished in the other man's pocket, extracted a cigarette,  and lighted it with trembling fingers. \"It's bad, then,\"  he said finally.\n\n\n \"It's bad, all right.\"\n\n\n Some shadow of the sly, elfin grin crept over the little con-man's  face. \"Well, at any rate, I'm glad they sent you over,\"  he said weakly. \"Nothing like a good lawyer to handle a trial.\"\n\n\n \" Lawyer? Not me! Oh, no. Sorry, but no thanks.\" Meyerhoff  chuckled. \"I'm your advisor, old boy. Nothing else. I'm here  to keep you from botching things up still worse for the Trading  Commission, that's all. I wouldn't get tangled up in a mess  with those creatures for anything!\" He shook his head. \"You're  your own lawyer, Mr. Super-salesman. It's all your show. And  you'd better get your head out of the sand, or you're going to  lose a case like it's never been lost before!\" Meyerhoff watched the man's pale face, and shook his head.  In a way, he thought, it was a pity to see such a change in the  rosy-cheeked, dapper, cocksure little man who had talked his  way glibly in and out of more jams than Meyerhoff could  count. Trading brought scalpers; it was almost inevitable that  where rich and unexploited trading ground was uncovered, it  would first fall prey to the fast-trading boys. They spread out  from Terra with the first wave of exploration\u2014the slick, fast-talking  con-men who could work new territories unfettered by  the legal restrictions that soon closed down the more established  planets. The first men in were the richest out, and  through some curious quirk of the Terrestrial mind, they knew  they could count on Terran protection, however crooked and  underhand their methods.\n\n\n But occasionally a situation arose where the civilization and  social practices of the alien victims made it unwise to tamper  with them. Altair I had been recognized at once by the Trading  Commission as a commercial prize of tremendous value, but  early reports had warned of the danger of wildcat trading on  the little, musty, jungle-like planet with its shaggy, three-eyed  inhabitants\u2014warned specifically against the confidence tactics  so frequently used\u2014but there was always somebody, Meyerhoff  reflected sourly, who just didn't get the word.\n\n\n Zeckler puffed nervously on his cigarette, his narrow face  a study in troubled concentration. \"But I didn't do anything!\"  he exploded finally. \"So I pulled an old con game. So what?  Why should they get so excited? So I clipped a few thousand  credits, pulled a little fast business.\" He shrugged eloquently,  spreading his hands. \"Everybody's doing it. They do it to each  other without batting an eye. You should see these critters  operate on each other. Why, my little scheme was peanuts by  comparison.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff pulled a pipe from his pocket, and began stuffing  the bowl with infinite patience. \"And precisely what sort of  con game was it?\" he asked quietly.\n\n\n Zeckler shrugged again. \"The simplest, tiredest, moldiest  old racket that ever made a quick nickel. Remember the old  Terran gag about the Brooklyn Bridge? The same thing. Only  these critters didn't want bridges. They wanted land\u2014this  gooey, slimy swamp they call 'farm land.' So I gave them  what they wanted. I just sold them some land.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff nodded fiercely. \"You sure did. A hundred square  kilos at a swipe. Only you sold the same hundred square kilos  to a dozen different natives.\" Suddenly he threw back his hands  and roared. \"Of all the things you shouldn't have done\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But what's a chunk of land?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff shook his head hopelessly. \"If you hadn't been  so greedy, you'd have found out what a chunk of land was to  these natives before you started peddling it. You'd have found  out other things about them, too. You'd have learned that  in spite of all their bumbling and fussing and squabbling  they're not so dull. You'd have found out that they're marsupials,  and that two out of five of them get thrown out of  their mother's pouch before they're old enough to survive.  You'd have realized that they have to start fighting for individual  rights almost as soon as they're born. Anything goes,  as long as it benefits them as individuals.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff grinned at the little man's horrified face. \"Never  heard of that, had you? And you've never heard of other things,  too. You've probably never heard that there are just too many  Altairians here for the food their planet can supply, and their  diet is so finicky that they just can't live on anything that  doesn't grow here. And consequently, land is the key factor  in their economy, not money; nothing but land. To get land,  it's every man for himself, and the loser starves, and their  entire legal and monetary system revolves on that principle.  They've built up the most confusing and impossible system of  barter and trade imaginable, aimed at individual survival, with  land as the value behind the credit. That explains the lying\u2014of  course they're liars, with an economy like that. They've  completely missed the concept of truth. Pathological? You bet  they're pathological! Only a fool would tell the truth when his  life depended on his being a better liar than the next guy!  Lying is the time-honored tradition, with their entire legal  system built around it.\"\n\n\n Zeckler snorted. \"But how could they possibly have a legal  system? I mean, if they don't recognize the truth when it slaps  them in the face?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff shrugged. \"As we understand legal systems, I  suppose they don't have one. They have only the haziest idea  what truth represents, and they've shrugged off the idea as  impossible and useless.\" He chuckled maliciously. \"So you  went out and found a chunk of ground in the uplands, and  sold it to a dozen separate, self-centered, half-starved natives!  Encroachment on private property is legal grounds for murder  on this planet, and twelve of them descended on the same  chunk of land at the same time, all armed with title-deeds.\"  Meyerhoff sighed. \"You've got twelve mad Altairians in your  hair. You've got a mad planet in your hair. And in the meantime,  Terra's most valuable uranium source in five centuries  is threatening to cut off supply unless they see your blood  splattered liberally all the way from here to the equator.\"\n\n\n Zeckler was visibly shaken. \"Look,\" he said weakly, \"so I  wasn't so smart. What am I going to do? I mean, are you  going to sit quietly by and let them butcher me? How could  I defend myself in a legal setup like this ?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff smiled coolly. \"You're going to get your sly little  con-man brain to working, I think,\" he said softly. \"By Interplanetary  Rules, they have to give you a trial in Terran legal  form\u2014judge, jury, court procedure, all that folderol. They  think it's a big joke\u2014after all, what could a judicial oath mean  to them?\u2014but they agreed. Only thing is, they're going to  hang you, if they die trying. So you'd better get those stunted  little wits of yours clicking\u2014and if you try to implicate me ,  even a little bit, I'll be out of there so fast you won't know  what happened.\"\n\n\n With that Meyerhoff walked to the door. He jerked it inward  sharply, and spilled two guards over on their faces.  \"Privacy,\" he grunted, and started back up the slippery corridor. It certainly looked like a courtroom, at any rate. In the front  of the long, damp stone room was a bench, with a seat behind  it, and a small straight chair to the right. To the left was a stand  with twelve chairs\u2014larger chairs, with a railing running along  the front. The rest of the room was filled almost to the door  with seats facing the bench. Zeckler followed the shaggy-haired  guard into the room, nodding approvingly. \"Not such a bad  arrangement,\" he said. \"They must have gotten the idea fast.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff wiped the perspiration from his forehead, and  shot the little con-man a stony glance. \"At least you've got  a courtroom, a judge, and a jury for this mess. Beyond that\u2014\"  He shrugged eloquently. \"I can't make any promises.\"\n\n\n In the back of the room a door burst open with a bang.  Loud, harsh voices were heard as half a dozen of the huge  Altairians attempted to push through the door at once. Zeckler  clamped on the headset to his translator unit, and watched the  hubbub in the anteroom with growing alarm. Finally the question  of precedent seemed to be settled, and a group of the  Altairians filed in, in order of stature, stalking across the room  in flowing black robes, pug-nosed faces glowering with self-importance.  They descended upon the jury box, grunting and  scrapping with each other for the first-row seats, and the judge  took his place with obvious satisfaction behind the heavy  wooden bench. Finally, the prosecuting attorney appeared,  flanked by two clerks, who took their places beside him. The  prosecutor eyed Zeckler with cold malevolence, then turned  and delivered a sly wink at the judge.\n\n\n In a moment the room was a hubbub as it filled with the  huge, bumbling, bear-like creatures, jostling each other and  fighting for seats, growling and complaining. Two small fights  broke out in the rear, but were quickly subdued by the group  of gendarmes guarding the entrance. Finally the judge glared  down at Zeckler with all three eyes, and pounded the bench top  with a wooden mallet until the roar of activity subsided. The  jurymen wriggled uncomfortably in their seats, exchanging  winks, and finally turned their attention to the front of the  court.\n\n\n \"We are reading the case of the people of Altair I,\" the  judge's voice roared out, \"against one Harry Zeckler\u2014\" he  paused for a long, impressive moment\u2014\"Terran.\" The courtroom  immediately burst into an angry growl, until the judge  pounded the bench five or six times more. \"This\u2014creature\u2014is  hereby accused of the following crimes,\" the judge bellowed.  \"Conspiracy to overthrow the government of Altair I. Brutal  murder of seventeen law-abiding citizens of the village of  Karzan at the third hour before dawn in the second period  after his arrival. Desecration of the Temple of our beloved  Goddess Zermat, Queen of the Harvest. Conspiracy with the  lesser gods to cause the unprecedented drought in the Dermatti  section of our fair globe. Obscene exposure of his pouch-marks  in a public square. Four separate and distinct charges of jail-break  and bribery\u2014\" The judge pounded the bench for order\u2014\"Espionage  with the accursed scum of Altair II in preparation  for interplanetary invasion.\"\n\n\n The little con-man's jaw sagged lower and lower, the color  draining from his face. He turned, wide-eyed, to Meyerhoff,  then back to the judge.\n\n\n \"The Chairman of the Jury,\" said the Judge succinctly, \"will  read the verdict.\"\n\n\n The little native in the front of the jury-box popped up like  a puppet on a string. \"Defendant found guilty on all counts,\"  he said.\n\n\n \"Defendant is guilty! The court will pronounce sentence\u2014\"\n\n\n \" Now wait a minute! \" Zeckler was on his feet, wild-eyed.  \"What kind of railroad job\u2014\"\n\n\n The judge blinked disappointedly at Paul Meyerhoff. \"Not  yet?\" he asked, unhappily.\n\n\n \"No.\" Meyerhoff's hands twitched nervously. \"Not yet, Your  Honor. Later, Your Honor. The trial comes first .\"\n\n\n The judge looked as if his candy had been stolen. \"But you said I should call for the verdict.\"\n\n\n \"Later. You have to have the trial before you can have the  verdict.\"\n\n\n The Altairian shrugged indifferently. \"Now\u2014later\u2014\" he  muttered.\n\n\n \"Have the prosecutor call his first witness,\" said Meyerhoff.\n\n\n Zeckler leaned over, his face ashen. \"These charges,\" he  whispered. \"They're insane!\"\n\n\n \"Of course they are,\" Meyerhoff whispered back.\n\n\n \"But what am I going to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit tight. Let them set things up.\"\n\n\n \"But those lies . They're liars, the whole pack of them\u2014\" He  broke off as the prosecutor roared a name.\n\n\n The shaggy brute who took the stand was wearing a bright  purple hat which sat rakishly over one ear. He grinned the  Altairian equivalent of a hungry grin at the prosecutor. Then  he cleared his throat and started. \"This Terran riffraff\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The oath,\" muttered the judge. \"We've got to have the  oath.\"\n\n\n The prosecutor nodded, and four natives moved forward,  carrying huge inscribed marble slabs to the front of the court.  One by one the chunks were reverently piled in a heap at the  witness's feet. The witness placed a huge, hairy paw on the  cairn, and the prosecutor said, \"Do you swear to tell the truth,  the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you\u2014\" he  paused to squint at the paper in his hand, and finished on a  puzzled note, \"\u2014Goddess?\"\n\n\n The witness removed the paw from the rock pile long enough  to scratch his ear. Then he replaced it, and replied, \"Of course,\"  in an injured tone.\n\n\n \"Then tell this court what you have seen of the activities of  this abominable wretch.\"\n\n\n The witness settled back into the chair, fixing one eye on  Zeckler's face, another on the prosecutor, and closing the third  as if in meditation. \"I think it happened on the fourth night  of the seventh crossing of Altair II (may the Goddess cast  a drought upon it)\u2014or was it the seventh night of the fourth  crossing?\u2014\" he grinned apologetically at the judge\u2014\"when I  was making my way back through town toward my blessed  land-plot, minding my own business, Your Honor, after weeks  of bargaining for the crop I was harvesting. Suddenly from the  shadow of the building, this creature\u2014\" he waved a paw at  Zeckler\u2014\"stopped me in my tracks with a vicious cry. He had  a weapon I'd never seen before, and before I could find my  voice he forced me back against the wall. I could see by the  cruel glint in his eyes that there was no warmth, no sympathy  in his heart, that I was\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Objection!\" Zeckler squealed plaintively, jumping to his  feet. \"This witness can't even remember what night he's talking  about!\"\n\n\n The judge looked startled. Then he pawed feverishly through  his bundle of notes. \"Overruled,\" he said abruptly. \"Continue,  please.\"\n\n\n The witness glowered at Zeckler. \"As I was saying before  this loutish interruption,\" he muttered, \"I could see that I was  face to face with the most desperate of criminal types, even  for Terrans. Note the shape of his head, the flabbiness of his  ears. I was petrified with fear. And then, helpless as I was, this  two-legged abomination began to shower me with threats of  evil to my blessed home, dark threats of poisoning my land  unless I would tell him where he could find the resting place  of our blessed Goddess\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I never saw him before in my life,\" Zeckler moaned to  Meyerhoff. \"Listen to him! Why should I care where their  Goddess\u2014\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff gave him a stony look. \"The Goddess runs things  around here. She makes it rain. If it doesn't rain, somebody's  insulted her. It's very simple.\"\n\n\n \"But how can I fight testimony like that?\"\n\n\n \"I doubt if you can fight it.\"\n\n\n \"But they can't prove a word of it\u2014\" He looked at the jury,  who were listening enraptured to the second witness on the  stand. This one was testifying regarding the butcherous slaughter  of eighteen (or was it twenty-three? Oh, yes, twenty-three)  women and children in the suburban village of Karzan. The  pogrom, it seemed, had been accomplished by an energy  weapon which ate great, gaping holes in the sides of buildings.  A third witness took the stand, continuing the drone as the  room grew hotter and muggier. Zeckler grew paler and paler,  his eyes turning glassy as the testimony piled up. \"But it's not true ,\" he whispered to Meyerhoff.\n\n\n \"Of course it isn't! Can't you understand? These people  have no regard for truth. It's stupid, to them, silly, a mark of  low intelligence. The only thing in the world they have any  respect for is a liar bigger and more skillful than they are.\"\n\n\n Zeckler jerked around abruptly as he heard his name bellowed  out. \"Does the defendant have anything to say before  the jury delivers the verdict?\"\n\n\n \"Do I have\u2014\" Zeckler was across the room in a flash, his  pale cheeks suddenly taking on a feverish glow. He sat down  gingerly on the witness chair, facing the judge, his eyes bright  with fear and excitement. \"Your\u2014Your Honor, I\u2014I have a  statement to make which will have a most important bearing  on this case. You must listen with the greatest care.\" He  glanced quickly at Meyerhoff, and back to the judge. \"Your  Honor,\" he said in a hushed voice. \"You are in gravest of  danger. All of you. Your lives\u2014your very land is at stake.\"\n\n\n The judge blinked, and shuffled through his notes hurriedly  as a murmur arose in the court. \"Our land?\"\n\n\n \"Your lives, your land, everything you hold dear,\" Zeckler  said quickly, licking his lips nervously. \"You must try to  understand me\u2014\" he glanced apprehensively over his shoulder  \"now, because I may not live long enough to repeat what  I am about to tell you\u2014\"\n\n\n The murmur quieted down, all ears straining in their headsets  to hear his words. \"These charges,\" he continued, \"all of  them\u2014they're perfectly true. At least, they seem to be perfectly  true. But in every instance, I was working with heart and  soul, risking my life, for the welfare of your beautiful planet.\"\n\n\n There was a loud hiss from the back of the court. Zeckler  frowned and rubbed his hands together. \"It was my misfortune,\"  he said, \"to go to the wrong planet when I first came to  Altair from my homeland on Terra. I\u2014I landed on Altair II,  a grave mistake, but as it turned out, a very fortunate error.  Because in attempting to arrange trading in that frightful place,  I made certain contacts.\" His voice trembled, and sank lower.  \"I learned the horrible thing which is about to happen to this  planet, at the hands of those barbarians. The conspiracy is  theirs, not mine. They have bribed your Goddess, flattered her  and lied to her, coerced her all-powerful goodness to their own  evil interests, preparing for the day when they could persuade  her to cast your land into the fiery furnace of a ten-year-drought\u2014\"\n\n\n Somebody in the middle of the court burst out laughing.  One by one the natives nudged one another, and booed, and  guffawed, until the rising tide of racket drowned out Zeckler's  words. \"The defendant is obviously lying,\" roared the prosecutor  over the pandemonium. \"Any fool knows that the Goddess  can't be bribed. How could she be a Goddess if she could?\"\n\n\n Zeckler grew paler. \"But\u2014perhaps they were very clever\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And how could they flatter her, when she knows, beyond  doubt, that she is the most exquisitely radiant creature in all  the Universe? And you dare to insult her, drag her name in  the dirt.\"\n\n\n The hisses grew louder, more belligerent. Cries of \"Butcher  him!\" and \"Scald his bowels!\" rose from the courtroom. The  judge banged for silence, his eyes angry.\n\n\n \"Unless the defendant wishes to take up more of our precious  time with these ridiculous lies, the jury\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Wait! Your Honor, I request a short recess before I present  my final plea.\"\n\n\n \"Recess?\"\n\n\n \"A few moments to collect my thoughts, to arrange my  case.\"\n\n\n The judge settled back with a disgusted snarl. \"Do I have  to?\" he asked Meyerhoff.\n\n\n Meyerhoff nodded. The judge shrugged, pointing over his  shoulder to the anteroom. \"You can go in there,\" he said.\n\n\n Somehow, Zeckler managed to stumble from the witness  stand, amid riotous boos and hisses, and tottered into the anteroom. Zeckler puffed hungrily on a cigarette, and looked up at  Meyerhoff with haunted eyes. \"It\u2014it doesn't look so good,\"  he muttered.\n\n\n Meyerhoff's eyes were worried, too. For some reason, he  felt a surge of pity and admiration for the haggard con-man.  \"It's worse than I'd anticipated,\" he admitted glumly. \"That  was a good try, but you just don't know enough about them  and their Goddess.\" He sat down wearily. \"I don't see what  you can do. They want your blood, and they're going to have  it. They just won't believe you, no matter how big a lie you  tell.\"\n\n\n Zeckler sat in silence for a moment. \"This lying business,\"  he said finally, \"exactly how does it work?\"\n\n\n \"The biggest, most convincing liar wins. It's as simple as  that. It doesn't matter how outlandish a whopper you tell.  Unless, of course, they've made up their minds that you just  naturally aren't as big a liar as they are. And it looks like that's  just what they've done. It wouldn't make any difference to  them what you say\u2014unless, somehow, you could make them  believe it.\"\n\n\n Zeckler frowned. \"And how do they regard the\u2014the biggest  liar? I mean, how do they feel toward him?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff shifted uneasily. \"It's hard to say. It's been my  experience that they respect him highly\u2014maybe even fear him  a little. After all, the most convincing liar always wins in any  transaction, so he gets more land, more food, more power.  Yes, I think the biggest liar could go where he pleased without  any interference.\"\n\n\n Zeckler was on his feet, his eyes suddenly bright with excitement.  \"Wait a minute,\" he said tensely. \"To tell them a lie  that they'd have to believe\u2014a lie they simply couldn't help but believe\u2014\" He turned on Meyerhoff, his hands trembling.  \"Do they think the way we do? I mean, with logic, cause and  effect, examining evidence and drawing conclusions? Given  certain evidence, would they have to draw the same conclusions  that we have to draw?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff blinked. \"Well\u2014yes. Oh, yes, they're perfectly  logical.\"\n\n\n Zeckler's eyes flashed, and a huge grin broke out on his  sallow face. His thin body fairly shook. He started hopping  up and down on one foot, staring idiotically into space. \"If I  could only think\u2014\" he muttered. \"Somebody\u2014somewhere\u2014something  I read.\"\n\n\n \"Whatever are you talking about?\"\n\n\n \"It was a Greek, I think\u2014\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff stared at him. \"Oh, come now. Have you gone  off your rocker completely? You've got a problem on your  hands, man.\"\n\n\n \"No, no, I've got a problem in the bag!\" Zeckler's cheeks  flushed. \"Let's go back in there\u2014I think I've got an answer!\"\n\n\n The courtroom quieted the moment they opened the door,  and the judge banged the gavel for silence. As soon as Zeckler  had taken his seat on the witness stand, the judge turned to  the head juryman. \"Now, then,\" he said with happy finality.  \"The jury\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold on! Just one minute more.\"\n\n\n The judge stared down at Zeckler as if he were a bug on a  rock. \"Oh, yes. You had something else to say. Well, go ahead  and say it.\"\n\n\n Zeckler looked sharply around the hushed room. \"You want  to convict me,\" he said softly, \"in the worst sort of way. Isn't  that right?\"\n\n\n Eyes swung toward him. The judge broke into an evil grin.  \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"But you can't really convict me until you've considered  carefully any statement I make in my own defense. Isn't that  right?\"\n\n\n The judge looked uncomfortable. \"If you've got something  to say, go ahead and say it.\"\n\n\n \"I've got just one statement to make. Short and sweet. But  you'd better listen to it, and think it out carefully before you  decide that you really want to convict me.\" He paused, and  glanced slyly at the judge. \"You don't think much of those  who tell the truth, it seems. Well, put this statement in your  record, then.\" His voice was loud and clear in the still room.  \" All Earthmen are absolutely incapable of telling the truth. \"\n\n\n Puzzled frowns appeared on the jury's faces. One or two  exchanged startled glances, and the room was still as death.  The judge stared at him, and then at Meyerhoff, then back.  \"But you\"\u2014he stammered. \"You're\"\u2014He stopped in mid-sentence,  his jaw sagging.\n\n\n One of the jurymen let out a little squeak, and fainted dead  away. It took, all in all, about ten seconds for the statement  to soak in.\n\n\n And then pandemonium broke loose in the courtroom. \"Really,\" said Harry Zeckler loftily, \"it was so obvious I'm  amazed that it didn't occur to me first thing.\" He settled himself  down comfortably in the control cabin of the Interplanetary  Rocket and grinned at the outline of Altair IV looming larger  in the view screen.\n\n\n Paul Meyerhoff stared stonily at the controls, his lips compressed  angrily. \"You might at least have told me what you  were planning.\"\n\n\n \"And take the chance of being overheard? Don't be silly.  It had to come as a bombshell. I had to establish myself as a  liar\u2014the prize liar of them all, but I had to tell the sort of lie  that they simply could not cope with. Something that would  throw them into such utter confusion that they wouldn't dare convict me.\" He grinned impishly at Meyerhoff. \"The paradox  of Epimenides the Cretan. It really stopped them cold. They knew I was an Earthmen, which meant that my statement that  Earthmen were liars was a lie, which meant that maybe I wasn't  a liar, in which case\u2014oh, it was tailor-made.\"\n\n\n \"It sure was.\" Meyerhoff's voice was a snarl.\n\n\n \"Well, it made me out a liar in a class they couldn't approach,  didn't it?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff's face was purple with anger. \"Oh, indeed it did!  And it put all Earthmen in exactly the same class, too.\"\n\n\n \"So what's honor among thieves? I got off, didn't I?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff turned on him fiercely. \"Oh, you got off just fine.  You scared the living daylights out of them. And in an eon of  lying they never have run up against a short-circuit like that.  You've also completely botched any hope of ever setting up  a trading alliance with Altair I, and that includes uranium, too.  Smart people don't gamble with loaded dice. You scared them  so badly they don't want anything to do with us.\"\n\n\n Zeckler's grin broadened, and he leaned back luxuriously.  \"Ah, well. After all, the Trading Alliance was your outlook,  wasn't it? What a pity!\" He clucked his tongue sadly. \"Me,  I've got a fortune in credits sitting back at the consulate waiting  for me\u2014enough to keep me on silk for quite a while, I  might say. I think I'll just take a nice, long vacation.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff turned to him, and a twinkle of malignant glee  appeared in his eyes. \"Yes, I think you will. I'm quite sure of  it, in fact. Won't cost you a cent, either.\"\n\n\n \"Eh?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff grinned unpleasantly. He brushed an imaginary  lint fleck from his lapel, and looked up at Zeckler slyly. \"That\u2014uh\u2014jury  trial. The Altairians weren't any too happy to  oblige. They wanted to execute you outright. Thought a trial  was awfully silly\u2014until they got their money back, of course.  Not too much\u2014just three million credits.\"\n\n\n Zeckler went white. \"But that money was in banking custody!\"\n\n\n \"Is that right? My goodness. You don't suppose they could  have lost those papers, do you?\" Meyerhoff grinned at the  little con-man. \"And incidentally, you're under arrest, you  know.\"\n\n\n A choking sound came from Zeckler's throat. \" Arrest! \"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. Didn't I tell you? Conspiring to undermine the  authority of the Terran Trading Commission. Serious charge,  you know. Yes, I think we'll take a nice long vacation together,  straight back to Terra. And there I think you'll face a jury  trial.\"\n\n\n Zeckler spluttered. \"There's no evidence\u2014you've got nothing  on me! What kind of a frame are you trying to pull?\"\n\n\n \"A lovely frame. Airtight. A frame from the bottom up, and  you're right square in the middle. And this time\u2014\" Meyerhoff  tapped a cigarette on his thumb with happy finality\u2014\"this time  I don't think you'll get off.\" Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from \"Tiger by the Tail and Other Science Fiction  Stories by Alan E.

Nourse The  place was dark and damp, and smelled like moldy leaves.  Meyerhoff followed the huge, bear-like Altairian guard  down the slippery flagstones of the corridor, sniffing the  dead, musty air with distaste. He drew his carefully tailored  Terran-styled jacket closer about his shoulders, shivering as his  eyes avoided the black, yawning cell-holes they were passing.  His foot slipped on the slimy flags from time to time, and  finally he paused to wipe the caked mud from his trouser leg.  \"How much farther is it?\" he shouted angrily.\n\n\n The guard waved a heavy paw vaguely into the blackness  ahead. Quite suddenly the corridor took a sharp bend, and the  Altairian stopped, producing a huge key ring from some obscure  fold of his hairy hide. \"I still don't see any reason for  all the fuss,\" he grumbled in a wounded tone. \"We've treated  him like a brother.\"\n\n\n One of the huge steel doors clicked open. Meyerhoff peered  into the blackness, catching a vaguely human outline against  the back wall. \"Harry?\" he called sharply.\n\n\n There was a startled gasp from within, and a skinny, gnarled  little man suddenly appeared in the guard's light, like a grotesque,  twisted ghost out of the blackness. Wide blue eyes  regarded Meyerhoff from beneath uneven black eyebrows, and  then the little man's face broke into a crafty grin. \"Paul! So  they sent you ! I knew I could count on it!\" He executed a  deep, awkward bow, motioning Meyerhoff into the dark  cubicle. \"Not much to offer you,\" he said slyly, \"but it's the  best I can do under the circumstances.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff scowled, and turned abruptly to the guard. \"We'll  have some privacy now, if you please. Interplanetary ruling.  And leave us the light.\"\n\n\n The guard grumbled, and started for the door. \"It's about  time you showed up!\" cried the little man in the cell. \"Great  day! Lucky they sent you, pal. Why, I've been in here for  years\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Zeckler, the name is Meyerhoff, and I'm not your  pal,\" Meyerhoff snapped. \"And you've been here for two  weeks, three days, and approximately four hours. You're getting  as bad as your gentle guards when it comes to bandying  the truth around.\" He peered through the dim light at the  gaunt face of the prisoner. Zeckler's face was dark with a  week's beard, and his bloodshot eyes belied the cocky grin  on his lips. His clothes were smeared and sodden, streaked  with great splotches of mud and moss. Meyerhoff's face softened  a little. \"So Harry Zeckler's in a jam again,\" he said.  \"You look as if they'd treated you like a brother.\"\n\n\n The little man snorted. \"These overgrown teddy-bears don't  know what brotherhood means, nor humanity, either. Bread  and water I've been getting, nothing more, and then only if they  feel like bringing it down.\" He sank wearily down on the rock  bench along the wall. \"I thought you'd never get here! I sent  an appeal to the Terran Consulate the first day I was arrested.  What happened? I mean, all they had to do was get a man  over here, get the extradition papers signed, and provide transportation  off the planet for me. Why so much time? I've been  sitting here rotting\u2014\" He broke off in mid-sentence and stared  at Meyerhoff. \"You brought the papers, didn't you? I mean,  we can leave now?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff stared at the little man with a mixture of pity and  disgust. \"You are a prize fool,\" he said finally. \"Did you know  that?\"\n\n\n Zeckler's eyes widened. \"What do you mean, fool? So I  spend a couple of weeks in this pneumonia trap. The deal was  worth it! I've got three million credits sitting in the Terran  Consulate on Altair V, just waiting for me to walk in and pick  them up. Three million credits\u2014do you hear? That's enough  to set me up for life!\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff nodded grimly. \" If you live long enough to walk  in and pick them up, that is.\"\n\n\n \"What do you mean, if?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff sank down beside the man, his voice a tense  whisper in the musty cell. \"I mean that right now you are  practically dead. You may not know it, but you are. You walk  into a newly opened planet with your smart little bag of tricks,  walk in here with a shaky passport and no permit, with no  knowledge of the natives outside of two paragraphs of inaccuracies  in the Explorer's Guide, and even then you're not  content to come in and sell something legitimate, something  the natives might conceivably be able to use. No, nothing so  simple for you. You have to pull your usual high-pressure stuff.  And this time, buddy, you're paying the piper.\"\n\n\n \" You mean I'm not being extradited? \"\n\n\n Meyerhoff grinned unpleasantly. \"I mean precisely that.  You've committed a crime here\u2014a major crime. The Altairians  are sore about it. And the Terran Consulate isn't willing  to sell all the trading possibilities here down the river just to  get you out of a mess. You're going to stand trial\u2014and these  natives are out to get you. Personally, I think they're going to get you.\"\n\n\n Zeckler stood up shakily. \"You can't believe anything the  natives say,\" he said uneasily. \"They're pathological liars.  Why, you should see what they tried to sell me ! You've never  seen such a pack of liars as these critters.\" He glanced up at  Meyerhoff. \"They'll probably drop a little fine on me and let  me go.\"\n\n\n \"A little fine of one Terran neck.\" Meyerhoff grinned nastily.  \"You've committed the most heinous crime these creatures can  imagine, and they're going to get you for it if it's the last thing  they do. I'm afraid, my friend, that your con-man days are  over.\"\n\n\n Zeckler fished in the other man's pocket, extracted a cigarette,  and lighted it with trembling fingers. \"It's bad, then,\"  he said finally.\n\n\n \"It's bad, all right.\"\n\n\n Some shadow of the sly, elfin grin crept over the little con-man's  face. \"Well, at any rate, I'm glad they sent you over,\"  he said weakly. \"Nothing like a good lawyer to handle a trial.\"\n\n\n \" Lawyer? Not me! Oh, no. Sorry, but no thanks.\" Meyerhoff  chuckled. \"I'm your advisor, old boy. Nothing else. I'm here  to keep you from botching things up still worse for the Trading  Commission, that's all. I wouldn't get tangled up in a mess  with those creatures for anything!\" He shook his head. \"You're  your own lawyer, Mr. Super-salesman. It's all your show. And  you'd better get your head out of the sand, or you're going to  lose a case like it's never been lost before!\" Meyerhoff watched the man's pale face, and shook his head.  In a way, he thought, it was a pity to see such a change in the  rosy-cheeked, dapper, cocksure little man who had talked his  way glibly in and out of more jams than Meyerhoff could  count. Trading brought scalpers; it was almost inevitable that  where rich and unexploited trading ground was uncovered, it  would first fall prey to the fast-trading boys. They spread out  from Terra with the first wave of exploration\u2014the slick, fast-talking  con-men who could work new territories unfettered by  the legal restrictions that soon closed down the more established  planets. The first men in were the richest out, and  through some curious quirk of the Terrestrial mind, they knew  they could count on Terran protection, however crooked and  underhand their methods.\n\n\n But occasionally a situation arose where the civilization and  social practices of the alien victims made it unwise to tamper  with them. Altair I had been recognized at once by the Trading  Commission as a commercial prize of tremendous value, but  early reports had warned of the danger of wildcat trading on  the little, musty, jungle-like planet with its shaggy, three-eyed  inhabitants\u2014warned specifically against the confidence tactics  so frequently used\u2014but there was always somebody, Meyerhoff  reflected sourly, who just didn't get the word.\n\n\n Zeckler puffed nervously on his cigarette, his narrow face  a study in troubled concentration. \"But I didn't do anything!\"  he exploded finally. \"So I pulled an old con game. So what?  Why should they get so excited? So I clipped a few thousand  credits, pulled a little fast business.\" He shrugged eloquently,  spreading his hands. \"Everybody's doing it. They do it to each  other without batting an eye. You should see these critters  operate on each other. Why, my little scheme was peanuts by  comparison.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff pulled a pipe from his pocket, and began stuffing  the bowl with infinite patience. \"And precisely what sort of  con game was it?\" he asked quietly.\n\n\n Zeckler shrugged again. \"The simplest, tiredest, moldiest  old racket that ever made a quick nickel. Remember the old  Terran gag about the Brooklyn Bridge? The same thing. Only  these critters didn't want bridges. They wanted land\u2014this  gooey, slimy swamp they call 'farm land.' So I gave them  what they wanted. I just sold them some land.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff nodded fiercely. \"You sure did. A hundred square  kilos at a swipe. Only you sold the same hundred square kilos  to a dozen different natives.\" Suddenly he threw back his hands  and roared. \"Of all the things you shouldn't have done\u2014\"\n\n\n \"But what's a chunk of land?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff shook his head hopelessly. \"If you hadn't been  so greedy, you'd have found out what a chunk of land was to  these natives before you started peddling it. You'd have found  out other things about them, too. You'd have learned that  in spite of all their bumbling and fussing and squabbling  they're not so dull. You'd have found out that they're marsupials,  and that two out of five of them get thrown out of  their mother's pouch before they're old enough to survive.  You'd have realized that they have to start fighting for individual  rights almost as soon as they're born. Anything goes,  as long as it benefits them as individuals.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff grinned at the little man's horrified face. \"Never  heard of that, had you? And you've never heard of other things,  too. You've probably never heard that there are just too many  Altairians here for the food their planet can supply, and their  diet is so finicky that they just can't live on anything that  doesn't grow here. And consequently, land is the key factor  in their economy, not money; nothing but land. To get land,  it's every man for himself, and the loser starves, and their  entire legal and monetary system revolves on that principle.  They've built up the most confusing and impossible system of  barter and trade imaginable, aimed at individual survival, with  land as the value behind the credit. That explains the lying\u2014of  course they're liars, with an economy like that. They've  completely missed the concept of truth. Pathological? You bet  they're pathological! Only a fool would tell the truth when his  life depended on his being a better liar than the next guy!  Lying is the time-honored tradition, with their entire legal  system built around it.\"\n\n\n Zeckler snorted. \"But how could they possibly have a legal  system? I mean, if they don't recognize the truth when it slaps  them in the face?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff shrugged. \"As we understand legal systems, I  suppose they don't have one. They have only the haziest idea  what truth represents, and they've shrugged off the idea as  impossible and useless.\" He chuckled maliciously. \"So you  went out and found a chunk of ground in the uplands, and  sold it to a dozen separate, self-centered, half-starved natives!  Encroachment on private property is legal grounds for murder  on this planet, and twelve of them descended on the same  chunk of land at the same time, all armed with title-deeds.\"  Meyerhoff sighed. \"You've got twelve mad Altairians in your  hair. You've got a mad planet in your hair. And in the meantime,  Terra's most valuable uranium source in five centuries  is threatening to cut off supply unless they see your blood  splattered liberally all the way from here to the equator.\"\n\n\n Zeckler was visibly shaken. \"Look,\" he said weakly, \"so I  wasn't so smart. What am I going to do? I mean, are you  going to sit quietly by and let them butcher me? How could  I defend myself in a legal setup like this ?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff smiled coolly. \"You're going to get your sly little  con-man brain to working, I think,\" he said softly. \"By Interplanetary  Rules, they have to give you a trial in Terran legal  form\u2014judge, jury, court procedure, all that folderol. They  think it's a big joke\u2014after all, what could a judicial oath mean  to them?\u2014but they agreed. Only thing is, they're going to  hang you, if they die trying. So you'd better get those stunted  little wits of yours clicking\u2014and if you try to implicate me ,  even a little bit, I'll be out of there so fast you won't know  what happened.\"\n\n\n With that Meyerhoff walked to the door. He jerked it inward  sharply, and spilled two guards over on their faces.  \"Privacy,\" he grunted, and started back up the slippery corridor. It certainly looked like a courtroom, at any rate. In the front  of the long, damp stone room was a bench, with a seat behind  it, and a small straight chair to the right. To the left was a stand  with twelve chairs\u2014larger chairs, with a railing running along  the front. The rest of the room was filled almost to the door  with seats facing the bench. Zeckler followed the shaggy-haired  guard into the room, nodding approvingly. \"Not such a bad  arrangement,\" he said. \"They must have gotten the idea fast.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff wiped the perspiration from his forehead, and  shot the little con-man a stony glance. \"At least you've got  a courtroom, a judge, and a jury for this mess. Beyond that\u2014\"  He shrugged eloquently. \"I can't make any promises.\"\n\n\n In the back of the room a door burst open with a bang.  Loud, harsh voices were heard as half a dozen of the huge  Altairians attempted to push through the door at once. Zeckler  clamped on the headset to his translator unit, and watched the  hubbub in the anteroom with growing alarm. Finally the question  of precedent seemed to be settled, and a group of the  Altairians filed in, in order of stature, stalking across the room  in flowing black robes, pug-nosed faces glowering with self-importance.  They descended upon the jury box, grunting and  scrapping with each other for the first-row seats, and the judge  took his place with obvious satisfaction behind the heavy  wooden bench. Finally, the prosecuting attorney appeared,  flanked by two clerks, who took their places beside him. The  prosecutor eyed Zeckler with cold malevolence, then turned  and delivered a sly wink at the judge.\n\n\n In a moment the room was a hubbub as it filled with the  huge, bumbling, bear-like creatures, jostling each other and  fighting for seats, growling and complaining. Two small fights  broke out in the rear, but were quickly subdued by the group  of gendarmes guarding the entrance. Finally the judge glared  down at Zeckler with all three eyes, and pounded the bench top  with a wooden mallet until the roar of activity subsided. The  jurymen wriggled uncomfortably in their seats, exchanging  winks, and finally turned their attention to the front of the  court.\n\n\n \"We are reading the case of the people of Altair I,\" the  judge's voice roared out, \"against one Harry Zeckler\u2014\" he  paused for a long, impressive moment\u2014\"Terran.\" The courtroom  immediately burst into an angry growl, until the judge  pounded the bench five or six times more. \"This\u2014creature\u2014is  hereby accused of the following crimes,\" the judge bellowed.  \"Conspiracy to overthrow the government of Altair I. Brutal  murder of seventeen law-abiding citizens of the village of  Karzan at the third hour before dawn in the second period  after his arrival. Desecration of the Temple of our beloved  Goddess Zermat, Queen of the Harvest. Conspiracy with the  lesser gods to cause the unprecedented drought in the Dermatti  section of our fair globe. Obscene exposure of his pouch-marks  in a public square. Four separate and distinct charges of jail-break  and bribery\u2014\" The judge pounded the bench for order\u2014\"Espionage  with the accursed scum of Altair II in preparation  for interplanetary invasion.\"\n\n\n The little con-man's jaw sagged lower and lower, the color  draining from his face. He turned, wide-eyed, to Meyerhoff,  then back to the judge.\n\n\n \"The Chairman of the Jury,\" said the Judge succinctly, \"will  read the verdict.\"\n\n\n The little native in the front of the jury-box popped up like  a puppet on a string. \"Defendant found guilty on all counts,\"  he said.\n\n\n \"Defendant is guilty! The court will pronounce sentence\u2014\"\n\n\n \" Now wait a minute! \" Zeckler was on his feet, wild-eyed.  \"What kind of railroad job\u2014\"\n\n\n The judge blinked disappointedly at Paul Meyerhoff. \"Not  yet?\" he asked, unhappily.\n\n\n \"No.\" Meyerhoff's hands twitched nervously. \"Not yet, Your  Honor. Later, Your Honor. The trial comes first .\"\n\n\n The judge looked as if his candy had been stolen. \"But you said I should call for the verdict.\"\n\n\n \"Later. You have to have the trial before you can have the  verdict.\"\n\n\n The Altairian shrugged indifferently. \"Now\u2014later\u2014\" he  muttered.\n\n\n \"Have the prosecutor call his first witness,\" said Meyerhoff.\n\n\n Zeckler leaned over, his face ashen. \"These charges,\" he  whispered. \"They're insane!\"\n\n\n \"Of course they are,\" Meyerhoff whispered back.\n\n\n \"But what am I going to\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit tight. Let them set things up.\"\n\n\n \"But those lies . They're liars, the whole pack of them\u2014\" He  broke off as the prosecutor roared a name.\n\n\n The shaggy brute who took the stand was wearing a bright  purple hat which sat rakishly over one ear. He grinned the  Altairian equivalent of a hungry grin at the prosecutor. Then  he cleared his throat and started. \"This Terran riffraff\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The oath,\" muttered the judge. \"We've got to have the  oath.\"\n\n\n The prosecutor nodded, and four natives moved forward,  carrying huge inscribed marble slabs to the front of the court.  One by one the chunks were reverently piled in a heap at the  witness's feet. The witness placed a huge, hairy paw on the  cairn, and the prosecutor said, \"Do you swear to tell the truth,  the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you\u2014\" he  paused to squint at the paper in his hand, and finished on a  puzzled note, \"\u2014Goddess?\"\n\n\n The witness removed the paw from the rock pile long enough  to scratch his ear. Then he replaced it, and replied, \"Of course,\"  in an injured tone.\n\n\n \"Then tell this court what you have seen of the activities of  this abominable wretch.\"\n\n\n The witness settled back into the chair, fixing one eye on  Zeckler's face, another on the prosecutor, and closing the third  as if in meditation. \"I think it happened on the fourth night  of the seventh crossing of Altair II (may the Goddess cast  a drought upon it)\u2014or was it the seventh night of the fourth  crossing?\u2014\" he grinned apologetically at the judge\u2014\"when I  was making my way back through town toward my blessed  land-plot, minding my own business, Your Honor, after weeks  of bargaining for the crop I was harvesting. Suddenly from the  shadow of the building, this creature\u2014\" he waved a paw at  Zeckler\u2014\"stopped me in my tracks with a vicious cry. He had  a weapon I'd never seen before, and before I could find my  voice he forced me back against the wall. I could see by the  cruel glint in his eyes that there was no warmth, no sympathy  in his heart, that I was\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Objection!\" Zeckler squealed plaintively, jumping to his  feet. \"This witness can't even remember what night he's talking  about!\"\n\n\n The judge looked startled. Then he pawed feverishly through  his bundle of notes. \"Overruled,\" he said abruptly. \"Continue,  please.\"\n\n\n The witness glowered at Zeckler. \"As I was saying before  this loutish interruption,\" he muttered, \"I could see that I was  face to face with the most desperate of criminal types, even  for Terrans. Note the shape of his head, the flabbiness of his  ears. I was petrified with fear. And then, helpless as I was, this  two-legged abomination began to shower me with threats of  evil to my blessed home, dark threats of poisoning my land  unless I would tell him where he could find the resting place  of our blessed Goddess\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I never saw him before in my life,\" Zeckler moaned to  Meyerhoff. \"Listen to him! Why should I care where their  Goddess\u2014\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff gave him a stony look. \"The Goddess runs things  around here. She makes it rain. If it doesn't rain, somebody's  insulted her. It's very simple.\"\n\n\n \"But how can I fight testimony like that?\"\n\n\n \"I doubt if you can fight it.\"\n\n\n \"But they can't prove a word of it\u2014\" He looked at the jury,  who were listening enraptured to the second witness on the  stand. This one was testifying regarding the butcherous slaughter  of eighteen (or was it twenty-three? Oh, yes, twenty-three)  women and children in the suburban village of Karzan. The  pogrom, it seemed, had been accomplished by an energy  weapon which ate great, gaping holes in the sides of buildings.  A third witness took the stand, continuing the drone as the  room grew hotter and muggier. Zeckler grew paler and paler,  his eyes turning glassy as the testimony piled up. \"But it's not true ,\" he whispered to Meyerhoff.\n\n\n \"Of course it isn't! Can't you understand? These people  have no regard for truth. It's stupid, to them, silly, a mark of  low intelligence. The only thing in the world they have any  respect for is a liar bigger and more skillful than they are.\"\n\n\n Zeckler jerked around abruptly as he heard his name bellowed  out. \"Does the defendant have anything to say before  the jury delivers the verdict?\"\n\n\n \"Do I have\u2014\" Zeckler was across the room in a flash, his  pale cheeks suddenly taking on a feverish glow. He sat down  gingerly on the witness chair, facing the judge, his eyes bright  with fear and excitement. \"Your\u2014Your Honor, I\u2014I have a  statement to make which will have a most important bearing  on this case. You must listen with the greatest care.\" He  glanced quickly at Meyerhoff, and back to the judge. \"Your  Honor,\" he said in a hushed voice. \"You are in gravest of  danger. All of you. Your lives\u2014your very land is at stake.\"\n\n\n The judge blinked, and shuffled through his notes hurriedly  as a murmur arose in the court. \"Our land?\"\n\n\n \"Your lives, your land, everything you hold dear,\" Zeckler  said quickly, licking his lips nervously. \"You must try to  understand me\u2014\" he glanced apprehensively over his shoulder  \"now, because I may not live long enough to repeat what  I am about to tell you\u2014\"\n\n\n The murmur quieted down, all ears straining in their headsets  to hear his words. \"These charges,\" he continued, \"all of  them\u2014they're perfectly true. At least, they seem to be perfectly  true. But in every instance, I was working with heart and  soul, risking my life, for the welfare of your beautiful planet.\"\n\n\n There was a loud hiss from the back of the court. Zeckler  frowned and rubbed his hands together. \"It was my misfortune,\"  he said, \"to go to the wrong planet when I first came to  Altair from my homeland on Terra. I\u2014I landed on Altair II,  a grave mistake, but as it turned out, a very fortunate error.  Because in attempting to arrange trading in that frightful place,  I made certain contacts.\" His voice trembled, and sank lower.  \"I learned the horrible thing which is about to happen to this  planet, at the hands of those barbarians. The conspiracy is  theirs, not mine. They have bribed your Goddess, flattered her  and lied to her, coerced her all-powerful goodness to their own  evil interests, preparing for the day when they could persuade  her to cast your land into the fiery furnace of a ten-year-drought\u2014\"\n\n\n Somebody in the middle of the court burst out laughing.  One by one the natives nudged one another, and booed, and  guffawed, until the rising tide of racket drowned out Zeckler's  words. \"The defendant is obviously lying,\" roared the prosecutor  over the pandemonium. \"Any fool knows that the Goddess  can't be bribed. How could she be a Goddess if she could?\"\n\n\n Zeckler grew paler. \"But\u2014perhaps they were very clever\u2014\"\n\n\n \"And how could they flatter her, when she knows, beyond  doubt, that she is the most exquisitely radiant creature in all  the Universe? And you dare to insult her, drag her name in  the dirt.\"\n\n\n The hisses grew louder, more belligerent. Cries of \"Butcher  him!\" and \"Scald his bowels!\" rose from the courtroom. The  judge banged for silence, his eyes angry.\n\n\n \"Unless the defendant wishes to take up more of our precious  time with these ridiculous lies, the jury\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Wait! Your Honor, I request a short recess before I present  my final plea.\"\n\n\n \"Recess?\"\n\n\n \"A few moments to collect my thoughts, to arrange my  case.\"\n\n\n The judge settled back with a disgusted snarl. \"Do I have  to?\" he asked Meyerhoff.\n\n\n Meyerhoff nodded. The judge shrugged, pointing over his  shoulder to the anteroom. \"You can go in there,\" he said.\n\n\n Somehow, Zeckler managed to stumble from the witness  stand, amid riotous boos and hisses, and tottered into the anteroom. Zeckler puffed hungrily on a cigarette, and looked up at  Meyerhoff with haunted eyes. \"It\u2014it doesn't look so good,\"  he muttered.\n\n\n Meyerhoff's eyes were worried, too. For some reason, he  felt a surge of pity and admiration for the haggard con-man.  \"It's worse than I'd anticipated,\" he admitted glumly. \"That  was a good try, but you just don't know enough about them  and their Goddess.\" He sat down wearily. \"I don't see what  you can do. They want your blood, and they're going to have  it. They just won't believe you, no matter how big a lie you  tell.\"\n\n\n Zeckler sat in silence for a moment. \"This lying business,\"  he said finally, \"exactly how does it work?\"\n\n\n \"The biggest, most convincing liar wins. It's as simple as  that. It doesn't matter how outlandish a whopper you tell.  Unless, of course, they've made up their minds that you just  naturally aren't as big a liar as they are. And it looks like that's  just what they've done. It wouldn't make any difference to  them what you say\u2014unless, somehow, you could make them  believe it.\"\n\n\n Zeckler frowned. \"And how do they regard the\u2014the biggest  liar? I mean, how do they feel toward him?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff shifted uneasily. \"It's hard to say. It's been my  experience that they respect him highly\u2014maybe even fear him  a little. After all, the most convincing liar always wins in any  transaction, so he gets more land, more food, more power.  Yes, I think the biggest liar could go where he pleased without  any interference.\"\n\n\n Zeckler was on his feet, his eyes suddenly bright with excitement.  \"Wait a minute,\" he said tensely. \"To tell them a lie  that they'd have to believe\u2014a lie they simply couldn't help but believe\u2014\" He turned on Meyerhoff, his hands trembling.  \"Do they think the way we do? I mean, with logic, cause and  effect, examining evidence and drawing conclusions? Given  certain evidence, would they have to draw the same conclusions  that we have to draw?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff blinked. \"Well\u2014yes. Oh, yes, they're perfectly  logical.\"\n\n\n Zeckler's eyes flashed, and a huge grin broke out on his  sallow face. His thin body fairly shook. He started hopping  up and down on one foot, staring idiotically into space. \"If I  could only think\u2014\" he muttered. \"Somebody\u2014somewhere\u2014something  I read.\"\n\n\n \"Whatever are you talking about?\"\n\n\n \"It was a Greek, I think\u2014\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff stared at him. \"Oh, come now. Have you gone  off your rocker completely? You've got a problem on your  hands, man.\"\n\n\n \"No, no, I've got a problem in the bag!\" Zeckler's cheeks  flushed. \"Let's go back in there\u2014I think I've got an answer!\"\n\n\n The courtroom quieted the moment they opened the door,  and the judge banged the gavel for silence. As soon as Zeckler  had taken his seat on the witness stand, the judge turned to  the head juryman. \"Now, then,\" he said with happy finality.  \"The jury\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hold on! Just one minute more.\"\n\n\n The judge stared down at Zeckler as if he were a bug on a  rock. \"Oh, yes. You had something else to say. Well, go ahead  and say it.\"\n\n\n Zeckler looked sharply around the hushed room. \"You want  to convict me,\" he said softly, \"in the worst sort of way. Isn't  that right?\"\n\n\n Eyes swung toward him. The judge broke into an evil grin.  \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"But you can't really convict me until you've considered  carefully any statement I make in my own defense. Isn't that  right?\"\n\n\n The judge looked uncomfortable. \"If you've got something  to say, go ahead and say it.\"\n\n\n \"I've got just one statement to make. Short and sweet. But  you'd better listen to it, and think it out carefully before you  decide that you really want to convict me.\" He paused, and  glanced slyly at the judge. \"You don't think much of those  who tell the truth, it seems. Well, put this statement in your  record, then.\" His voice was loud and clear in the still room.  \" All Earthmen are absolutely incapable of telling the truth. \"\n\n\n Puzzled frowns appeared on the jury's faces. One or two  exchanged startled glances, and the room was still as death.  The judge stared at him, and then at Meyerhoff, then back.  \"But you\"\u2014he stammered. \"You're\"\u2014He stopped in mid-sentence,  his jaw sagging.\n\n\n One of the jurymen let out a little squeak, and fainted dead  away. It took, all in all, about ten seconds for the statement  to soak in.\n\n\n And then pandemonium broke loose in the courtroom. \"Really,\" said Harry Zeckler loftily, \"it was so obvious I'm  amazed that it didn't occur to me first thing.\" He settled himself  down comfortably in the control cabin of the Interplanetary  Rocket and grinned at the outline of Altair IV looming larger  in the view screen.\n\n\n Paul Meyerhoff stared stonily at the controls, his lips compressed  angrily. \"You might at least have told me what you  were planning.\"\n\n\n \"And take the chance of being overheard? Don't be silly.  It had to come as a bombshell. I had to establish myself as a  liar\u2014the prize liar of them all, but I had to tell the sort of lie  that they simply could not cope with. Something that would  throw them into such utter confusion that they wouldn't dare convict me.\" He grinned impishly at Meyerhoff. \"The paradox  of Epimenides the Cretan. It really stopped them cold. They knew I was an Earthmen, which meant that my statement that  Earthmen were liars was a lie, which meant that maybe I wasn't  a liar, in which case\u2014oh, it was tailor-made.\"\n\n\n \"It sure was.\" Meyerhoff's voice was a snarl.\n\n\n \"Well, it made me out a liar in a class they couldn't approach,  didn't it?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff's face was purple with anger. \"Oh, indeed it did!  And it put all Earthmen in exactly the same class, too.\"\n\n\n \"So what's honor among thieves? I got off, didn't I?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff turned on him fiercely. \"Oh, you got off just fine.  You scared the living daylights out of them. And in an eon of  lying they never have run up against a short-circuit like that.  You've also completely botched any hope of ever setting up  a trading alliance with Altair I, and that includes uranium, too.  Smart people don't gamble with loaded dice. You scared them  so badly they don't want anything to do with us.\"\n\n\n Zeckler's grin broadened, and he leaned back luxuriously.  \"Ah, well. After all, the Trading Alliance was your outlook,  wasn't it? What a pity!\" He clucked his tongue sadly. \"Me,  I've got a fortune in credits sitting back at the consulate waiting  for me\u2014enough to keep me on silk for quite a while, I  might say. I think I'll just take a nice, long vacation.\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff turned to him, and a twinkle of malignant glee  appeared in his eyes. \"Yes, I think you will. I'm quite sure of  it, in fact. Won't cost you a cent, either.\"\n\n\n \"Eh?\"\n\n\n Meyerhoff grinned unpleasantly. He brushed an imaginary  lint fleck from his lapel, and looked up at Zeckler slyly. \"That\u2014uh\u2014jury  trial. The Altairians weren't any too happy to  oblige. They wanted to execute you outright. Thought a trial  was awfully silly\u2014until they got their money back, of course.  Not too much\u2014just three million credits.\"\n\n\n Zeckler went white. \"But that money was in banking custody!\"\n\n\n \"Is that right? My goodness. You don't suppose they could  have lost those papers, do you?\" Meyerhoff grinned at the  little con-man. \"And incidentally, you're under arrest, you  know.\"\n\n\n A choking sound came from Zeckler's throat. \" Arrest! \"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. Didn't I tell you? Conspiring to undermine the  authority of the Terran Trading Commission. Serious charge,  you know. Yes, I think we'll take a nice long vacation together,  straight back to Terra. And there I think you'll face a jury  trial.\"\n\n\n Zeckler spluttered. \"There's no evidence\u2014you've got nothing  on me! What kind of a frame are you trying to pull?\"\n\n\n \"A lovely frame. Airtight. A frame from the bottom up, and  you're right square in the middle. And this time\u2014\" Meyerhoff  tapped a cigarette on his thumb with happy finality\u2014\"this time  I don't think you'll get off.\" Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from \"Tiger by the Tail and Other Science Fiction  Stories by Alan E.
