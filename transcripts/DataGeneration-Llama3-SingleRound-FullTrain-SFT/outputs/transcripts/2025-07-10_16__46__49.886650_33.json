There isn\u2019t  anything that Judy can\u2019t solve.\u201d Lorraine tilted her head disdainfully. \u201cWe\u2019re sisters  now. We\u2019re both Farringdon-Petts and should be  loyal to each other. But you always did take Judy\u2019s  part. She was the one who nearly spoiled our double  wedding trying to solve a mystery. I don\u2019t believe  she\u2019d understand\u2014understand any better than I do.  Everyone has problems, and I\u2019m sure Judy is no  exception.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right, Lorraine,\u201d announced Judy, coming  in to serve dessert to the two friends she had invited  for lunch at Peter\u2019s suggestion. \u201cI do have  problems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can\u2019t  solve.\u201d \u201cName one,\u201d charged Lois. \u201cJust mention one  single spooky thing you couldn\u2019t explain, and I\u2019ll  believe you. I\u2019ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton\u2014\u201d \u201cJudy Dobbs, remember?\u201d \u201cWell, you were Judy Bolton when you solved  all those mysteries. I met you when the whole  valley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened  by flood and you solved that\u2014\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d declared Judy, \u201cwas my brother Horace,  not me. He was the hero without even meaning to  be. He was the one who rode through town and  warned people that the flood was coming. I was off  chasing a shadow.\u201d \u201cA vanishing shadow,\u201d Lois said with a sigh.  \u201cWhat you did wasn\u2019t easy, Judy.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be as hard as it was,\u201d Judy confessed.  \u201cI know now that keeping that promise not  to talk about the dam was a great big mistake and  could have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.\u201d \u201cPlease,\u201d Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding  her pretty face, \u201clet\u2019s not talk about him now.\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cWhat shall we talk  about?\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d Lois said, \u201cand all the mysteries you\u2019ve  solved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or  two before the flood, but what about the haunted  house you moved into? You were the one who  tracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar  and goodness knows where all. You\u2019ve been chasing  ghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did  you fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.\u201d \u201cBefore I met you,\u201d Judy said, thinking back,  \u201cthere were plenty of them I couldn\u2019t explain. There  was one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but  what she was or how she spoke to me is more than  I know. If my grandparents knew, they weren\u2019t telling.  And now they\u2019re both dead and I can\u2019t ask them.  They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with  this house. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answers to some of  them when I finish sorting Grandma\u2019s things. They\u2019re  stored in one end of the attic.\u201d \u201cAnother haunted attic? How thrilling!\u201d exclaimed  Lois. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have another ghost party and  show up the spooks?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say the attic was haunted.\u201d Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She  wasn\u2019t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,  but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally  told them, the summer before they met. Horace  had just started working on the paper. Judy remembered  that it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard Thornton  Lee, who gave him his job with the Farringdon  Daily Herald . He had turned in some interesting  church news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that  he spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon  where the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted  mansion, while she had to suffer the heat and  loneliness of Dry Brook Hollow. Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she  confessed now as she reviewed everything that had  happened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the fact  that her parents left her every summer while they  went off on a vacation by themselves. What did they  think she would do? \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had told  her. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mystery  series you like. When they\u2019re finished there are  plenty of short stories around. Your grandmother  never throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019s  saved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for  them she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know how  you love to read.\u201d \u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d Judy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tired  eyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a  vacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too  little to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went to  the beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It  was a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton  and his wife relived it. And every summer Judy  went to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who  scolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019t  glad to have her. \u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,  and Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinkling  behind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do with  yourself this time?\u201d \u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad say  you have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d \u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if you  can stand the heat.\u201d Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so  much as to escape to a place where she could have a  good cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth  birthday. In another year she would have outgrown  her childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation or  be grown up enough to ask them to let her have a  vacation of her own. In another year she would  be summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands  and solving a mystery to be known as the Ghost  Parade . \u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be telling  her, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d But then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had no  idea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There  seemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tears  came and spilled over on one of the magazines. As  Judy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen  on a picture of a fountain. \u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201d  she remembered saying aloud. Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of  walking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett  mansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a  fountain still caught and held rainbows like those  she was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.  But all that was in the future. If anyone had told  the freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one  day marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in  their faces. \u201cThat tease!\u201d For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who  used to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day  she yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and so  are you!\u201d Peter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her a  kitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.  The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the  summer Judy found the picture of a fountain and  spilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,  she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to  pretend the fountain in the picture was filled with  all the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried. \u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenly  exclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered  it distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,  \u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people  know your wishes instead of muttering them to  yourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d \u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois. She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what  Judy was telling them without interruption. \u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.  \u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d And she went on to tell them how, the very next  day, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain  exactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center  of a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.  Beside the steps were smaller fountains with the  water spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy  had stared at them a moment and then climbed the  steps to the pool. \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she remembered saying aloud.  \u201cIs this beautiful fountain real?\u201d A voice had answered, although she could see no  one. \u201cMake your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you  shed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely  come true.\u201d \u201cA tear?\u201d Judy had asked. \u201cHow can I shed a  tear when I\u2019m happy? This is a wonderful place.\u201d \u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will  surely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated. \u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d \u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at your  grandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had reminded  her. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture up  there in the attic?\u201d \u201cThen you\u2014you are the fountain!\u201d Judy remembered  exclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. It  doesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d \u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain had  said in a mysterious whisper. CHAPTER II If Wishes Came True \u201cDid you?\u201d Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.  \u201cOh, Judy! Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any  longer. What did you wish?\u201d \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming  to that.\u201d First, she told her friends, she had to think of a  wise wish. There had been so much she wanted in  those early days before the flood. Dora Scott had  been her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved  away. \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of  having just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody  in Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how  lonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made  little ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before  they vanished, and so I began naming the things I  wanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were  wise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I  wasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,  and what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to  think of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted. Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.  Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied  airily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots  of friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a  G-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far  as I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the  spell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything  more.\u201d \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois  asked. \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more  things. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep  pets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one  about the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I  wanted. It was a sister near my own age. That  seemed impossible at the time, but the future did  hold a sister for me.\u201d \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing  Lorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think  sisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then  it was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter  or that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t  know he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the  strangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was  enchanted?\u201d Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she  answered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so  at the time. I wandered around, growing very  drowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into  it. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember  waking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain  had been a dream.\u201d \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it  wasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured  her, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a  beautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick  with roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d \u201cAll the year around?\u201d Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,  \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long  way from June to December.\u201d \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy  said, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any  time of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,  and I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.  I explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her. \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream  you\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t  you try to solve the mystery?\u201d \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif  I had been older or more experienced. I really should  have investigated it more thoroughly and learned the  secret of the fountain. But after the ripples went  away it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t  really think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing  for a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem  impossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine  was your friend.\u201d \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.  \u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by  the Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that  things started happening so fast that I completely  forgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t  believe I thought about it again until after we moved  to Farringdon and I walked up to your door and  saw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d  Lois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve  seen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the  picture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll  show you.\u201d Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while  Judy was telling them the story of the fountain.  Somehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had  tasted it too often while she was making it. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided. Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up  the chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously  with cream. \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks  he\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including  lettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?  He wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there  are any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle. Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with  the cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her  grandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s  tastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was  removed. But there was still a door closing off the  narrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry  reached it first and yowled for Judy to open it. \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where  I\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and  the cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling  noise came from the floor above. \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid  of,\u201d Judy urged her friends. \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d  confessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing  room at the top of the last flight of stairs. \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious  about black cats, but they are creepy. Does  Blackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.  Pausing at still another door that led to the darker  part of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,  \u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody  care to explore the past?\u201d The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy  relating still more of what she remembered about  the fountain. \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and  said I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came  true that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would  she?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this  house she was still burning kerosene lamps like those  you see on that high shelf by the window. I think  she and Grandpa like the way they lived without  any modern conveniences or anything.\u201d \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the  old attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died  the same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they  wished neither of them would outlive the other. If  they did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more  thoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.  Another could have been to keep the good old days,  as Grandma used to call them. That one came true  in a way. They did manage to keep a little of the  past when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what  I meant about turning back the clock.\u201d \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little  myself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things  were the way they used to be when I trusted  Arthur\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked. Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois  and Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all  she would say. Judy wondered, as they searched  through the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine  was of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed  monster coming between her and her handsome husband,  Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had  seemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness  in Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of  the fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt  is. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d  Judy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m  sure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly  to Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.  But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.  If she did, she pretended not to. \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love  to, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.  \u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little  more closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks  like the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.  \u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny  all the way to Farringdon.\u201d \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe  Brandts own that stretch of woods just before you  come into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine  back in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly  to her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off  into the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.  \u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There  isn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents  took?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d  Lois suggested. CHAPTER III A Strange Encounter Lorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposed  trip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed to  it under one condition. They were not to drive all  the way to the house which, she said, was just over  the hilltop. They were to park the car where no  one would see it and follow the path to the fountain. \u201cBut suppose we can\u2019t find the path?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember it, won\u2019t you?\u201d Judy thought she would, but she wasn\u2019t too sure.  She and Lois both argued that it would be better to  inquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly. \u201cShe\u2019d be glad to show us around. This way it  looks as if we\u2019re planning a crime,\u201d Lois said as they  started off in the blue car she was driving. It was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, and  easy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughed  and said if they did find the fountain she thought  she\u2019d wish for one exactly like it. \u201cWell, you know what your grandmother said  about wishes, don\u2019t you?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIf you  let people know about them instead of muttering  them to yourself most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d \u201cQuite true,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll let Peter know  about this one. He\u2019s my Santa Claus, and it will soon  be Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the fur  coat he gave me last year.\u201d \u201cYour reversible\u2019s better in case it rains. It\u2019s too  warm for snow. We picked a perfect day for this  trip,\u201d Lois continued, guiding the car around curves  as it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow. The trip was a short one. In twenty minutes they  had covered the distance that had seemed such a  long way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather\u2019s  wagon. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019ve  just about figured out how it happened. I didn\u2019t  think my grandparents knew the Brandts well enough  to pay them a visit, though. We must have looked  queer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa\u2019s  old farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had  some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn\u2019t  explain what happened afterwards. When I woke  up in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse,  wagon, grandparents\u2014all had disappeared.\u201d \u201cHow could they?\u201d asked Lois. \u201cAnyway,\u201d Lorraine began, \u201cyou had a chance to  see how beautiful everything was before\u2014\u201d Again she broke off as if there were something  she wanted to tell but didn\u2019t quite dare. \u201cBefore what?\u201d questioned Judy. \u201cOh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. You  were telling us how you woke up in the hammock,  but you never did explain how you got back home,\u201d  Lorraine reminded her. \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten a lot of it,  but it\u2019s beginning to come back now. I do remember  driving home along this road. You see, I thought my  grandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise  and would return for me. I told you I was all alone.  There wasn\u2019t a house in sight.\u201d \u201cThe Brandt house is just over the top of this next  hill,\u201d Lois put in. \u201cI know. You told me that. Now I know why I  couldn\u2019t see it. All I could see was a windowless old  tower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally,  I followed it. There\u2019s something about a path in  the woods that always tempts me.\u201d \u201cWe know that, Judy. Honey told us all about  your latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.\u201d \u201cWell, this trail led out of the rose garden where  the hammock was and then through an archway,\u201d  Judy continued. \u201cAll sorts of little cupids and gnomes  peered out at me from unexpected places. I was  actually scared by the time I reached the old tower.  There wasn\u2019t time to explore it. Just then I heard  the rumble of my grandfather\u2019s wagon and knew he  was driving off without me.\u201d \u201cHe was!\u201d Judy\u2019s friends both chorused in surprise,  and Lois asked, \u201cWhy would he do a thing like  that?\u201d \u201cI think now it was just to tease me. He did stop  and wait for me after a while,\u201d Judy remembered.  \u201cThe rugs were gone. Grandma must have delivered  them, but I didn\u2019t ask where. If she made them for  Mrs. Brandt they may still be there.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t depend on it,\u201d Lorraine said as they  turned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate. \u201cWatch out!\u201d Judy suddenly exclaimed. \u201cThere\u2019s  another car coming.\u201d As Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraine  ducked her head. She kept herself hidden behind  Judy until the car had passed. The man driving  it was a stranger to Judy, but she would remember  his hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for a  long time. The soft brown hat he was wearing covered  most of his hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you two?\u201d asked Lois  when the car had passed. \u201cAren\u2019t you a little old for  playing hide and seek?\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014playing. Let\u2019s not go up there,\u201d Lorraine  begged. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Brandts live there  any more.\u201d \u201cMaybe not, but we can pretend we think they do,  can\u2019t we?\u201d Judy replied a little uncertainly. She was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knew  more about the Brandt estate than she was telling. Lois kept on driving along the narrow, gravelly  road. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedge  of rhododendrons to be seen. They looked very  green next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond.  The sky was gray with white clouds being driven  across it by the wind. \u201cThere\u2019s the tower!\u201d Lorraine exclaimed. \u201cI can  see it over to the left. It looks like something out of  Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cIt looks grim all right,\u201d agreed Judy. \u201cI wonder  what it is.\u201d \u201cI suppose it\u2019s nothing but an old water tower. It  would be fun to explore it, though,\u201d Lois said. \u201cBut  if there are new people living here they\u2019ll never give  us permission.\u201d \u201cWe might explore it without permission,\u201d Judy  suggested daringly. \u201cCome on!\u201d she urged her friends  as Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside the  road. \u201cWho\u2019s going to stop us? And who wants to  explore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let\u2019s look for  the fountain.\u201d \u201cDo you think we should?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIt  won\u2019t be enchanted. I told you\u2014\u201d \u201cYou told us very little,\u201d Lois reminded her. \u201cIf  you know anything about the people who live here  now, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise,  I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be very welcome.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll welcome us, anyway. I do  know who they are,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cYou remember  Roger Banning from school, don\u2019t you?  I\u2019ve seen him around here. His family must have  acquired sudden wealth, or else he\u2019s just working on  the estate.\u201d \u201cThen you\u2019ve been here lately? Why didn\u2019t you  tell me?\u201d asked Lois. \u201cWe always used to go places  together.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t important,\u201d Lorraine replied evasively.  \u201cI was just out for a drive.\u201d \u201cYou plutocrats!\u201d laughed Judy. \u201cEach with a  car of your own. You\u2019re not interested in Roger  Banning, are you, Lois? I\u2019m sure you can do better  than that. I did know him slightly, but not from  school. The boys and girls were separated and went  to different high schools by the time we moved to  Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, a  lot better. He was in our young people\u2019s group at  church.\u201d \u201cSh!\u201d Lois cautioned her. \u201cNice people no longer  mention Dick Hartwell\u2019s name. He\u2019s doing time.\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d asked Judy. Like Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred facts  to gossip. \u201cForgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks from  his father\u2019s desk and forged the names of a lot of important  business people. I think he forged some legal  documents, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary.  It was all in the papers,\u201d Lorraine told her. Now Judy did remember. It was something she  would have preferred to forget. She liked to think  she was a good judge of character, and she had taken  Dick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who would  never stoop to crime. \u201cI don\u2019t see what all this has to do with the fountain,\u201d  Lois said impatiently. \u201cAre we going to look  for it, or aren\u2019t we?\u201d \u201cOf course we are. That\u2019s what we came for. I  just like to know what a tiger looks like before he  springs at me,\u201d Judy explained. \u201cYou seem to think there\u2019s danger in this expedition  of ours, don\u2019t you?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. You\u2019re the one who  seems to know the answers, but you\u2019re not telling.  Hiding your face back there gave you away. You\u2019ve  seen that character who drove down this road and,  for some reason, you were afraid he would see you.  Why, Lorraine? Why didn\u2019t you want to be recognized?\u201d Lorraine hesitated a moment and then replied  evasively, \u201cPeople don\u2019t generally enter private  estates without an invitation. That\u2019s all.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d better turn the car around,\u201d Lois decided,  \u201cin case we have to leave in a hurry. I don\u2019t expect  we\u2019ll encounter any tigers, but we may be accused  of trespassing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure we will be,\u201d announced Judy as two  dark-coated figures strode down the road toward  them. \u201cYou drove right by a  NO TRESPASSING  sign,  and this isn\u2019t a welcoming committee coming to  meet us!\u201d ",

There isn\u2019t  anything that Judy can\u2019t solve.\u201d Lorraine tilted her head disdainfully. \u201cWe\u2019re sisters  now. We\u2019re both Farringdon-Petts and should be  loyal to each other. But you always did take Judy\u2019s  part. She was the one who nearly spoiled our double  wedding trying to solve a mystery. I don\u2019t believe  she\u2019d understand\u2014understand any better than I do.  Everyone has problems, and I\u2019m sure Judy is no  exception.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right, Lorraine,\u201d announced Judy, coming  in to serve dessert to the two friends she had invited  for lunch at Peter\u2019s suggestion. \u201cI do have  problems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can\u2019t  solve.\u201d \u201cName one,\u201d charged Lois. \u201cJust mention one  single spooky thing you couldn\u2019t explain, and I\u2019ll  believe you. I\u2019ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton\u2014\u201d \u201cJudy Dobbs, remember?\u201d \u201cWell, you were Judy Bolton when you solved  all those mysteries. I met you when the whole  valley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened  by flood and you solved that\u2014\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d declared Judy, \u201cwas my brother Horace,  not me. He was the hero without even meaning to  be. He was the one who rode through town and  warned people that the flood was coming. I was off  chasing a shadow.\u201d \u201cA vanishing shadow,\u201d Lois said with a sigh.  \u201cWhat you did wasn\u2019t easy, Judy.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be as hard as it was,\u201d Judy confessed.  \u201cI know now that keeping that promise not  to talk about the dam was a great big mistake and  could have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.\u201d \u201cPlease,\u201d Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding  her pretty face, \u201clet\u2019s not talk about him now.\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cWhat shall we talk  about?\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d Lois said, \u201cand all the mysteries you\u2019ve  solved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or  two before the flood, but what about the haunted  house you moved into? You were the one who  tracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar  and goodness knows where all. You\u2019ve been chasing  ghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did  you fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.\u201d \u201cBefore I met you,\u201d Judy said, thinking back,  \u201cthere were plenty of them I couldn\u2019t explain. There  was one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but  what she was or how she spoke to me is more than  I know. If my grandparents knew, they weren\u2019t telling.  And now they\u2019re both dead and I can\u2019t ask them.  They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with  this house. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answers to some of  them when I finish sorting Grandma\u2019s things. They\u2019re  stored in one end of the attic.\u201d \u201cAnother haunted attic? How thrilling!\u201d exclaimed  Lois. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have another ghost party and  show up the spooks?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say the attic was haunted.\u201d Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She  wasn\u2019t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,  but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally  told them, the summer before they met. Horace  had just started working on the paper. Judy remembered  that it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard Thornton  Lee, who gave him his job with the Farringdon  Daily Herald . He had turned in some interesting  church news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that  he spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon  where the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted  mansion, while she had to suffer the heat and  loneliness of Dry Brook Hollow. Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she  confessed now as she reviewed everything that had  happened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the fact  that her parents left her every summer while they  went off on a vacation by themselves. What did they  think she would do? \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had told  her. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mystery  series you like. When they\u2019re finished there are  plenty of short stories around. Your grandmother  never throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019s  saved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for  them she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know how  you love to read.\u201d \u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d Judy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tired  eyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a  vacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too  little to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went to  the beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It  was a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton  and his wife relived it. And every summer Judy  went to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who  scolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019t  glad to have her. \u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,  and Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinkling  behind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do with  yourself this time?\u201d \u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad say  you have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d \u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if you  can stand the heat.\u201d Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so  much as to escape to a place where she could have a  good cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth  birthday. In another year she would have outgrown  her childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation or  be grown up enough to ask them to let her have a  vacation of her own. In another year she would  be summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands  and solving a mystery to be known as the Ghost  Parade . \u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be telling  her, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d But then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had no  idea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There  seemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tears  came and spilled over on one of the magazines. As  Judy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen  on a picture of a fountain. \u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201d  she remembered saying aloud. Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of  walking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett  mansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a  fountain still caught and held rainbows like those  she was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.  But all that was in the future. If anyone had told  the freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one  day marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in  their faces. \u201cThat tease!\u201d For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who  used to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day  she yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and so  are you!\u201d Peter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her a  kitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.  The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the  summer Judy found the picture of a fountain and  spilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,  she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to  pretend the fountain in the picture was filled with  all the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried. \u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenly  exclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered  it distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,  \u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people  know your wishes instead of muttering them to  yourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d \u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois. She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what  Judy was telling them without interruption. \u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.  \u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d And she went on to tell them how, the very next  day, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain  exactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center  of a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.  Beside the steps were smaller fountains with the  water spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy  had stared at them a moment and then climbed the  steps to the pool. \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she remembered saying aloud.  \u201cIs this beautiful fountain real?\u201d A voice had answered, although she could see no  one. \u201cMake your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you  shed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely  come true.\u201d \u201cA tear?\u201d Judy had asked. \u201cHow can I shed a  tear when I\u2019m happy? This is a wonderful place.\u201d \u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will  surely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated. \u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d \u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at your  grandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had reminded  her. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture up  there in the attic?\u201d \u201cThen you\u2014you are the fountain!\u201d Judy remembered  exclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. It  doesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d \u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain had  said in a mysterious whisper. CHAPTER II If Wishes Came True \u201cDid you?\u201d Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.  \u201cOh, Judy! Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any  longer. What did you wish?\u201d \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming  to that.\u201d First, she told her friends, she had to think of a  wise wish. There had been so much she wanted in  those early days before the flood. Dora Scott had  been her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved  away. \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of  having just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody  in Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how  lonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made  little ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before  they vanished, and so I began naming the things I  wanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were  wise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I  wasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,  and what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to  think of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted. Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.  Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied  airily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots  of friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a  G-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far  as I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the  spell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything  more.\u201d \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois  asked. \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more  things. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep  pets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one  about the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I  wanted. It was a sister near my own age. That  seemed impossible at the time, but the future did  hold a sister for me.\u201d \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing  Lorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think  sisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then  it was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter  or that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t  know he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the  strangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was  enchanted?\u201d Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she  answered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so  at the time. I wandered around, growing very  drowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into  it. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember  waking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain  had been a dream.\u201d \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it  wasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured  her, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a  beautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick  with roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d \u201cAll the year around?\u201d Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,  \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long  way from June to December.\u201d \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy  said, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any  time of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,  and I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.  I explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her. \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream  you\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t  you try to solve the mystery?\u201d \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif  I had been older or more experienced. I really should  have investigated it more thoroughly and learned the  secret of the fountain. But after the ripples went  away it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t  really think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing  for a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem  impossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine  was your friend.\u201d \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.  \u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by  the Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that  things started happening so fast that I completely  forgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t  believe I thought about it again until after we moved  to Farringdon and I walked up to your door and  saw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d  Lois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve  seen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the  picture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll  show you.\u201d Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while  Judy was telling them the story of the fountain.  Somehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had  tasted it too often while she was making it. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided. Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up  the chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously  with cream. \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks  he\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including  lettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?  He wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there  are any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle. Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with  the cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her  grandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s  tastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was  removed. But there was still a door closing off the  narrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry  reached it first and yowled for Judy to open it. \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where  I\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and  the cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling  noise came from the floor above. \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid  of,\u201d Judy urged her friends. \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d  confessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing  room at the top of the last flight of stairs. \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious  about black cats, but they are creepy. Does  Blackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.  Pausing at still another door that led to the darker  part of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,  \u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody  care to explore the past?\u201d The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy  relating still more of what she remembered about  the fountain. \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and  said I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came  true that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would  she?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this  house she was still burning kerosene lamps like those  you see on that high shelf by the window. I think  she and Grandpa like the way they lived without  any modern conveniences or anything.\u201d \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the  old attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died  the same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they  wished neither of them would outlive the other. If  they did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more  thoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.  Another could have been to keep the good old days,  as Grandma used to call them. That one came true  in a way. They did manage to keep a little of the  past when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what  I meant about turning back the clock.\u201d \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little  myself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things  were the way they used to be when I trusted  Arthur\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked. Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois  and Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all  she would say. Judy wondered, as they searched  through the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine  was of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed  monster coming between her and her handsome husband,  Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had  seemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness  in Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of  the fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt  is. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d  Judy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m  sure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly  to Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.  But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.  If she did, she pretended not to. \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love  to, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.  \u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little  more closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks  like the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.  \u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny  all the way to Farringdon.\u201d \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe  Brandts own that stretch of woods just before you  come into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine  back in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly  to her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off  into the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.  \u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There  isn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents  took?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d  Lois suggested. CHAPTER III A Strange Encounter Lorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposed  trip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed to  it under one condition. They were not to drive all  the way to the house which, she said, was just over  the hilltop. They were to park the car where no  one would see it and follow the path to the fountain. \u201cBut suppose we can\u2019t find the path?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember it, won\u2019t you?\u201d Judy thought she would, but she wasn\u2019t too sure.  She and Lois both argued that it would be better to  inquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly. \u201cShe\u2019d be glad to show us around. This way it  looks as if we\u2019re planning a crime,\u201d Lois said as they  started off in the blue car she was driving. It was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, and  easy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughed  and said if they did find the fountain she thought  she\u2019d wish for one exactly like it. \u201cWell, you know what your grandmother said  about wishes, don\u2019t you?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIf you  let people know about them instead of muttering  them to yourself most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d \u201cQuite true,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll let Peter know  about this one. He\u2019s my Santa Claus, and it will soon  be Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the fur  coat he gave me last year.\u201d \u201cYour reversible\u2019s better in case it rains. It\u2019s too  warm for snow. We picked a perfect day for this  trip,\u201d Lois continued, guiding the car around curves  as it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow. The trip was a short one. In twenty minutes they  had covered the distance that had seemed such a  long way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather\u2019s  wagon. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019ve  just about figured out how it happened. I didn\u2019t  think my grandparents knew the Brandts well enough  to pay them a visit, though. We must have looked  queer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa\u2019s  old farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had  some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn\u2019t  explain what happened afterwards. When I woke  up in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse,  wagon, grandparents\u2014all had disappeared.\u201d \u201cHow could they?\u201d asked Lois. \u201cAnyway,\u201d Lorraine began, \u201cyou had a chance to  see how beautiful everything was before\u2014\u201d Again she broke off as if there were something  she wanted to tell but didn\u2019t quite dare. \u201cBefore what?\u201d questioned Judy. \u201cOh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. You  were telling us how you woke up in the hammock,  but you never did explain how you got back home,\u201d  Lorraine reminded her. \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten a lot of it,  but it\u2019s beginning to come back now. I do remember  driving home along this road. You see, I thought my  grandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise  and would return for me. I told you I was all alone.  There wasn\u2019t a house in sight.\u201d \u201cThe Brandt house is just over the top of this next  hill,\u201d Lois put in. \u201cI know. You told me that. Now I know why I  couldn\u2019t see it. All I could see was a windowless old  tower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally,  I followed it. There\u2019s something about a path in  the woods that always tempts me.\u201d \u201cWe know that, Judy. Honey told us all about  your latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.\u201d \u201cWell, this trail led out of the rose garden where  the hammock was and then through an archway,\u201d  Judy continued. \u201cAll sorts of little cupids and gnomes  peered out at me from unexpected places. I was  actually scared by the time I reached the old tower.  There wasn\u2019t time to explore it. Just then I heard  the rumble of my grandfather\u2019s wagon and knew he  was driving off without me.\u201d \u201cHe was!\u201d Judy\u2019s friends both chorused in surprise,  and Lois asked, \u201cWhy would he do a thing like  that?\u201d \u201cI think now it was just to tease me. He did stop  and wait for me after a while,\u201d Judy remembered.  \u201cThe rugs were gone. Grandma must have delivered  them, but I didn\u2019t ask where. If she made them for  Mrs. Brandt they may still be there.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t depend on it,\u201d Lorraine said as they  turned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate. \u201cWatch out!\u201d Judy suddenly exclaimed. \u201cThere\u2019s  another car coming.\u201d As Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraine  ducked her head. She kept herself hidden behind  Judy until the car had passed. The man driving  it was a stranger to Judy, but she would remember  his hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for a  long time. The soft brown hat he was wearing covered  most of his hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you two?\u201d asked Lois  when the car had passed. \u201cAren\u2019t you a little old for  playing hide and seek?\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014playing. Let\u2019s not go up there,\u201d Lorraine  begged. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Brandts live there  any more.\u201d \u201cMaybe not, but we can pretend we think they do,  can\u2019t we?\u201d Judy replied a little uncertainly. She was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knew  more about the Brandt estate than she was telling. Lois kept on driving along the narrow, gravelly  road. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedge  of rhododendrons to be seen. They looked very  green next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond.  The sky was gray with white clouds being driven  across it by the wind. \u201cThere\u2019s the tower!\u201d Lorraine exclaimed. \u201cI can  see it over to the left. It looks like something out of  Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cIt looks grim all right,\u201d agreed Judy. \u201cI wonder  what it is.\u201d \u201cI suppose it\u2019s nothing but an old water tower. It  would be fun to explore it, though,\u201d Lois said. \u201cBut  if there are new people living here they\u2019ll never give  us permission.\u201d \u201cWe might explore it without permission,\u201d Judy  suggested daringly. \u201cCome on!\u201d she urged her friends  as Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside the  road. \u201cWho\u2019s going to stop us? And who wants to  explore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let\u2019s look for  the fountain.\u201d \u201cDo you think we should?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIt  won\u2019t be enchanted. I told you\u2014\u201d \u201cYou told us very little,\u201d Lois reminded her. \u201cIf  you know anything about the people who live here  now, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise,  I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be very welcome.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll welcome us, anyway. I do  know who they are,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cYou remember  Roger Banning from school, don\u2019t you?  I\u2019ve seen him around here. His family must have  acquired sudden wealth, or else he\u2019s just working on  the estate.\u201d \u201cThen you\u2019ve been here lately? Why didn\u2019t you  tell me?\u201d asked Lois. \u201cWe always used to go places  together.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t important,\u201d Lorraine replied evasively.  \u201cI was just out for a drive.\u201d \u201cYou plutocrats!\u201d laughed Judy. \u201cEach with a  car of your own. You\u2019re not interested in Roger  Banning, are you, Lois? I\u2019m sure you can do better  than that. I did know him slightly, but not from  school. The boys and girls were separated and went  to different high schools by the time we moved to  Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, a  lot better. He was in our young people\u2019s group at  church.\u201d \u201cSh!\u201d Lois cautioned her. \u201cNice people no longer  mention Dick Hartwell\u2019s name. He\u2019s doing time.\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d asked Judy. Like Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred facts  to gossip. \u201cForgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks from  his father\u2019s desk and forged the names of a lot of important  business people. I think he forged some legal  documents, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary.  It was all in the papers,\u201d Lorraine told her. Now Judy did remember. It was something she  would have preferred to forget. She liked to think  she was a good judge of character, and she had taken  Dick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who would  never stoop to crime. \u201cI don\u2019t see what all this has to do with the fountain,\u201d  Lois said impatiently. \u201cAre we going to look  for it, or aren\u2019t we?\u201d \u201cOf course we are. That\u2019s what we came for. I  just like to know what a tiger looks like before he  springs at me,\u201d Judy explained. \u201cYou seem to think there\u2019s danger in this expedition  of ours, don\u2019t you?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. You\u2019re the one who  seems to know the answers, but you\u2019re not telling.  Hiding your face back there gave you away. You\u2019ve  seen that character who drove down this road and,  for some reason, you were afraid he would see you.  Why, Lorraine? Why didn\u2019t you want to be recognized?\u201d Lorraine hesitated a moment and then replied  evasively, \u201cPeople don\u2019t generally enter private  estates without an invitation. That\u2019s all.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d better turn the car around,\u201d Lois decided,  \u201cin case we have to leave in a hurry. I don\u2019t expect  we\u2019ll encounter any tigers, but we may be accused  of trespassing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure we will be,\u201d announced Judy as two  dark-coated figures strode down the road toward  them. \u201cYou drove right by a  NO TRESPASSING  sign,  and this isn\u2019t a welcoming committee coming to  meet us!\u201d \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho is Honey?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Judy's sister-in-law\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Judy's younger sister\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Judy's younger sister\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Judy's younger sister\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

There isn\u2019t  anything that Judy can\u2019t solve.\u201d Lorraine tilted her head disdainfully. \u201cWe\u2019re sisters  now. We\u2019re both Farringdon-Petts and should be  loyal to each other. But you always did take Judy\u2019s  part. She was the one who nearly spoiled our double  wedding trying to solve a mystery. I don\u2019t believe  she\u2019d understand\u2014understand any better than I do.  Everyone has problems, and I\u2019m sure Judy is no  exception.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right, Lorraine,\u201d announced Judy, coming  in to serve dessert to the two friends she had invited  for lunch at Peter\u2019s suggestion. \u201cI do have  problems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can\u2019t  solve.\u201d \u201cName one,\u201d charged Lois. \u201cJust mention one  single spooky thing you couldn\u2019t explain, and I\u2019ll  believe you. I\u2019ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton\u2014\u201d \u201cJudy Dobbs, remember?\u201d \u201cWell, you were Judy Bolton when you solved  all those mysteries. I met you when the whole  valley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened  by flood and you solved that\u2014\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d declared Judy, \u201cwas my brother Horace,  not me. He was the hero without even meaning to  be. He was the one who rode through town and  warned people that the flood was coming. I was off  chasing a shadow.\u201d \u201cA vanishing shadow,\u201d Lois said with a sigh.  \u201cWhat you did wasn\u2019t easy, Judy.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t need to be as hard as it was,\u201d Judy confessed.  \u201cI know now that keeping that promise not  to talk about the dam was a great big mistake and  could have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.\u201d \u201cPlease,\u201d Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding  her pretty face, \u201clet\u2019s not talk about him now.\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cWhat shall we talk  about?\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d Lois said, \u201cand all the mysteries you\u2019ve  solved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or  two before the flood, but what about the haunted  house you moved into? You were the one who  tracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar  and goodness knows where all. You\u2019ve been chasing  ghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did  you fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.\u201d \u201cBefore I met you,\u201d Judy said, thinking back,  \u201cthere were plenty of them I couldn\u2019t explain. There  was one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but  what she was or how she spoke to me is more than  I know. If my grandparents knew, they weren\u2019t telling.  And now they\u2019re both dead and I can\u2019t ask them.  They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with  this house. Maybe I\u2019ll find the answers to some of  them when I finish sorting Grandma\u2019s things. They\u2019re  stored in one end of the attic.\u201d \u201cAnother haunted attic? How thrilling!\u201d exclaimed  Lois. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have another ghost party and  show up the spooks?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say the attic was haunted.\u201d Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She  wasn\u2019t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,  but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally  told them, the summer before they met. Horace  had just started working on the paper. Judy remembered  that it was Lorraine\u2019s father, Richard Thornton  Lee, who gave him his job with the Farringdon  Daily Herald . He had turned in some interesting  church news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him  the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that  he spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon  where the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted  mansion, while she had to suffer the heat and  loneliness of Dry Brook Hollow. Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she  confessed now as she reviewed everything that had  happened. She just couldn\u2019t help resenting the fact  that her parents left her every summer while they  went off on a vacation by themselves. What did they  think she would do? \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to read,\u201d her father had told  her. \u201cI bought you six new books in that mystery  series you like. When they\u2019re finished there are  plenty of short stories around. Your grandmother  never throws anything away. She has magazines she\u2019s  saved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for  them she\u2019ll let you have the whole stack. I know how  you love to read.\u201d \u201cI do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old\u2014\u201d Judy had stopped. She had seen her father\u2019s tired  eyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a  vacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too  little to do. He and Judy\u2019s mother usually went to  the beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It  was a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton  and his wife relived it. And every summer Judy  went to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who  scolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn\u2019t  glad to have her. \u201cYou here again?\u201d she had greeted her that summer,  and Judy hadn\u2019t noticed her old eyes twinkling  behind her glasses. \u201cWhat do you propose to do with  yourself this time?\u201d \u201cRead,\u201d Judy had told her. \u201cMom and Dad say  you have a whole stack of old magazines\u2014\u201d \u201cIn the attic. Go up and look them over if you  can stand the heat.\u201d Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so  much as to escape to a place where she could have a  good cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth  birthday. In another year she would have outgrown  her childish resentment of her parents\u2019 vacation or  be grown up enough to ask them to let her have a  vacation of her own. In another year she would  be summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands  and solving a mystery to be known as the Ghost  Parade . \u201cA whole parade of ghosts,\u201d Lois would be telling  her, \u201cand you solved everything.\u201d But then she didn\u2019t even know Lois. She had no  idea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There  seemed to be nothing\u2014nothing\u2014and so the tears  came and spilled over on one of the magazines. As  Judy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen  on a picture of a fountain. \u201cA fountain with tears for water. How strange!\u201d  she remembered saying aloud. Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of  walking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett  mansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a  fountain still caught and held rainbows like those  she was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.  But all that was in the future. If anyone had told  the freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one  day marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in  their faces. \u201cThat tease!\u201d For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who  used to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day  she yelled back at him, \u201cCarrot-tops are green and so  are you!\u201d Peter was to win Judy\u2019s heart when he gave her a  kitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.  The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the  summer Judy found the picture of a fountain and  spilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,  she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to  pretend the fountain in the picture was filled with  all the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried. \u201cBut that would make it enchanted!\u201d she had suddenly  exclaimed. \u201cIf I could find it I\u2019d wish\u2014\u201d A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered  it distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother  and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,  \u201cEnchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people  know your wishes instead of muttering them to  yourself, most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d \u201cWere they?\u201d asked Lois. She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what  Judy was telling them without interruption. \u201cThat\u2019s the unsolved mystery,\u201d Judy replied.  \u201cThere weren\u2019t any of them impossible.\u201d And she went on to tell them how, the very next  day, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain  exactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center  of a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.  Beside the steps were smaller fountains with the  water spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy  had stared at them a moment and then climbed the  steps to the pool. \u201cAm I dreaming?\u201d she remembered saying aloud.  \u201cIs this beautiful fountain real?\u201d A voice had answered, although she could see no  one. \u201cMake your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you  shed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely  come true.\u201d \u201cA tear?\u201d Judy had asked. \u201cHow can I shed a  tear when I\u2019m happy? This is a wonderful place.\u201d \u201cShed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will  surely come true,\u201d the voice had repeated. \u201cBut what is there to cry about?\u201d \u201cYou found plenty to cry about back at your  grandmother\u2019s house,\u201d the mysterious voice had reminded  her. \u201cWeren\u2019t you crying on my picture up  there in the attic?\u201d \u201cThen you\u2014you are the fountain!\u201d Judy remembered  exclaiming. \u201cBut a fountain doesn\u2019t speak. It  doesn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d \u201cWish wisely,\u201d the voice from the fountain had  said in a mysterious whisper. CHAPTER II If Wishes Came True \u201cDid you?\u201d Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.  \u201cOh, Judy! Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any  longer. What did you wish?\u201d \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming  to that.\u201d First, she told her friends, she had to think of a  wise wish. There had been so much she wanted in  those early days before the flood. Dora Scott had  been her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved  away. \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of  having just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody  in Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how  lonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made  little ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before  they vanished, and so I began naming the things I  wanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were  wise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I  wasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,  and what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to  think of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted. Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.  Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied  airily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots  of friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a  G-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far  as I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the  spell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything  more.\u201d \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois  asked. \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more  things. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep  pets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one  about the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I  wanted. It was a sister near my own age. That  seemed impossible at the time, but the future did  hold a sister for me.\u201d \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing  Lorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think  sisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then  it was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter  or that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t  know he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the  strangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was  enchanted?\u201d Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she  answered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so  at the time. I wandered around, growing very  drowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into  it. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember  waking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain  had been a dream.\u201d \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it  wasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured  her, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a  beautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick  with roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d \u201cAll the year around?\u201d Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,  \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long  way from June to December.\u201d \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy  said, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any  time of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,  and I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.  I explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her. \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream  you\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t  you try to solve the mystery?\u201d \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif  I had been older or more experienced. I really should  have investigated it more thoroughly and learned the  secret of the fountain. But after the ripples went  away it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t  really think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing  for a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem  impossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine  was your friend.\u201d \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.  \u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by  the Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that  things started happening so fast that I completely  forgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t  believe I thought about it again until after we moved  to Farringdon and I walked up to your door and  saw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d  Lois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve  seen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the  picture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll  show you.\u201d Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while  Judy was telling them the story of the fountain.  Somehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had  tasted it too often while she was making it. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided. Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up  the chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously  with cream. \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks  he\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including  lettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?  He wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there  are any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle. Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with  the cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her  grandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s  tastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was  removed. But there was still a door closing off the  narrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry  reached it first and yowled for Judy to open it. \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where  I\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and  the cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling  noise came from the floor above. \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid  of,\u201d Judy urged her friends. \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d  confessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing  room at the top of the last flight of stairs. \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious  about black cats, but they are creepy. Does  Blackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.  Pausing at still another door that led to the darker  part of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,  \u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody  care to explore the past?\u201d The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy  relating still more of what she remembered about  the fountain. \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and  said I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came  true that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would  she?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this  house she was still burning kerosene lamps like those  you see on that high shelf by the window. I think  she and Grandpa like the way they lived without  any modern conveniences or anything.\u201d \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the  old attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died  the same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they  wished neither of them would outlive the other. If  they did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more  thoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.  Another could have been to keep the good old days,  as Grandma used to call them. That one came true  in a way. They did manage to keep a little of the  past when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what  I meant about turning back the clock.\u201d \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little  myself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things  were the way they used to be when I trusted  Arthur\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked. Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois  and Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all  she would say. Judy wondered, as they searched  through the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine  was of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed  monster coming between her and her handsome husband,  Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had  seemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness  in Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of  the fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt  is. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d  Judy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m  sure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly  to Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.  But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.  If she did, she pretended not to. \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love  to, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.  \u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little  more closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks  like the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.  \u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny  all the way to Farringdon.\u201d \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe  Brandts own that stretch of woods just before you  come into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine  back in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly  to her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off  into the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.  \u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There  isn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents  took?\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d  Lois suggested. CHAPTER III A Strange Encounter Lorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposed  trip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed to  it under one condition. They were not to drive all  the way to the house which, she said, was just over  the hilltop. They were to park the car where no  one would see it and follow the path to the fountain. \u201cBut suppose we can\u2019t find the path?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember it, won\u2019t you?\u201d Judy thought she would, but she wasn\u2019t too sure.  She and Lois both argued that it would be better to  inquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly. \u201cShe\u2019d be glad to show us around. This way it  looks as if we\u2019re planning a crime,\u201d Lois said as they  started off in the blue car she was driving. It was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, and  easy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughed  and said if they did find the fountain she thought  she\u2019d wish for one exactly like it. \u201cWell, you know what your grandmother said  about wishes, don\u2019t you?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIf you  let people know about them instead of muttering  them to yourself most of them aren\u2019t so impossible.\u201d \u201cQuite true,\u201d Judy agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll let Peter know  about this one. He\u2019s my Santa Claus, and it will soon  be Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the fur  coat he gave me last year.\u201d \u201cYour reversible\u2019s better in case it rains. It\u2019s too  warm for snow. We picked a perfect day for this  trip,\u201d Lois continued, guiding the car around curves  as it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow. The trip was a short one. In twenty minutes they  had covered the distance that had seemed such a  long way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather\u2019s  wagon. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019ve  just about figured out how it happened. I didn\u2019t  think my grandparents knew the Brandts well enough  to pay them a visit, though. We must have looked  queer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa\u2019s  old farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had  some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn\u2019t  explain what happened afterwards. When I woke  up in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse,  wagon, grandparents\u2014all had disappeared.\u201d \u201cHow could they?\u201d asked Lois. \u201cAnyway,\u201d Lorraine began, \u201cyou had a chance to  see how beautiful everything was before\u2014\u201d Again she broke off as if there were something  she wanted to tell but didn\u2019t quite dare. \u201cBefore what?\u201d questioned Judy. \u201cOh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. You  were telling us how you woke up in the hammock,  but you never did explain how you got back home,\u201d  Lorraine reminded her. \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten a lot of it,  but it\u2019s beginning to come back now. I do remember  driving home along this road. You see, I thought my  grandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise  and would return for me. I told you I was all alone.  There wasn\u2019t a house in sight.\u201d \u201cThe Brandt house is just over the top of this next  hill,\u201d Lois put in. \u201cI know. You told me that. Now I know why I  couldn\u2019t see it. All I could see was a windowless old  tower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally,  I followed it. There\u2019s something about a path in  the woods that always tempts me.\u201d \u201cWe know that, Judy. Honey told us all about  your latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.\u201d \u201cWell, this trail led out of the rose garden where  the hammock was and then through an archway,\u201d  Judy continued. \u201cAll sorts of little cupids and gnomes  peered out at me from unexpected places. I was  actually scared by the time I reached the old tower.  There wasn\u2019t time to explore it. Just then I heard  the rumble of my grandfather\u2019s wagon and knew he  was driving off without me.\u201d \u201cHe was!\u201d Judy\u2019s friends both chorused in surprise,  and Lois asked, \u201cWhy would he do a thing like  that?\u201d \u201cI think now it was just to tease me. He did stop  and wait for me after a while,\u201d Judy remembered.  \u201cThe rugs were gone. Grandma must have delivered  them, but I didn\u2019t ask where. If she made them for  Mrs. Brandt they may still be there.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t depend on it,\u201d Lorraine said as they  turned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate. \u201cWatch out!\u201d Judy suddenly exclaimed. \u201cThere\u2019s  another car coming.\u201d As Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraine  ducked her head. She kept herself hidden behind  Judy until the car had passed. The man driving  it was a stranger to Judy, but she would remember  his hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for a  long time. The soft brown hat he was wearing covered  most of his hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you two?\u201d asked Lois  when the car had passed. \u201cAren\u2019t you a little old for  playing hide and seek?\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014playing. Let\u2019s not go up there,\u201d Lorraine  begged. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Brandts live there  any more.\u201d \u201cMaybe not, but we can pretend we think they do,  can\u2019t we?\u201d Judy replied a little uncertainly. She was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knew  more about the Brandt estate than she was telling. Lois kept on driving along the narrow, gravelly  road. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedge  of rhododendrons to be seen. They looked very  green next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond.  The sky was gray with white clouds being driven  across it by the wind. \u201cThere\u2019s the tower!\u201d Lorraine exclaimed. \u201cI can  see it over to the left. It looks like something out of  Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cIt looks grim all right,\u201d agreed Judy. \u201cI wonder  what it is.\u201d \u201cI suppose it\u2019s nothing but an old water tower. It  would be fun to explore it, though,\u201d Lois said. \u201cBut  if there are new people living here they\u2019ll never give  us permission.\u201d \u201cWe might explore it without permission,\u201d Judy  suggested daringly. \u201cCome on!\u201d she urged her friends  as Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside the  road. \u201cWho\u2019s going to stop us? And who wants to  explore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let\u2019s look for  the fountain.\u201d \u201cDo you think we should?\u201d Lorraine asked. \u201cIt  won\u2019t be enchanted. I told you\u2014\u201d \u201cYou told us very little,\u201d Lois reminded her. \u201cIf  you know anything about the people who live here  now, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise,  I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be very welcome.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll welcome us, anyway. I do  know who they are,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cYou remember  Roger Banning from school, don\u2019t you?  I\u2019ve seen him around here. His family must have  acquired sudden wealth, or else he\u2019s just working on  the estate.\u201d \u201cThen you\u2019ve been here lately? Why didn\u2019t you  tell me?\u201d asked Lois. \u201cWe always used to go places  together.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t important,\u201d Lorraine replied evasively.  \u201cI was just out for a drive.\u201d \u201cYou plutocrats!\u201d laughed Judy. \u201cEach with a  car of your own. You\u2019re not interested in Roger  Banning, are you, Lois? I\u2019m sure you can do better  than that. I did know him slightly, but not from  school. The boys and girls were separated and went  to different high schools by the time we moved to  Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, a  lot better. He was in our young people\u2019s group at  church.\u201d \u201cSh!\u201d Lois cautioned her. \u201cNice people no longer  mention Dick Hartwell\u2019s name. He\u2019s doing time.\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d asked Judy. Like Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred facts  to gossip. \u201cForgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks from  his father\u2019s desk and forged the names of a lot of important  business people. I think he forged some legal  documents, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary.  It was all in the papers,\u201d Lorraine told her. Now Judy did remember. It was something she  would have preferred to forget. She liked to think  she was a good judge of character, and she had taken  Dick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who would  never stoop to crime. \u201cI don\u2019t see what all this has to do with the fountain,\u201d  Lois said impatiently. \u201cAre we going to look  for it, or aren\u2019t we?\u201d \u201cOf course we are. That\u2019s what we came for. I  just like to know what a tiger looks like before he  springs at me,\u201d Judy explained. \u201cYou seem to think there\u2019s danger in this expedition  of ours, don\u2019t you?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. You\u2019re the one who  seems to know the answers, but you\u2019re not telling.  Hiding your face back there gave you away. You\u2019ve  seen that character who drove down this road and,  for some reason, you were afraid he would see you.  Why, Lorraine? Why didn\u2019t you want to be recognized?\u201d Lorraine hesitated a moment and then replied  evasively, \u201cPeople don\u2019t generally enter private  estates without an invitation. That\u2019s all.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d better turn the car around,\u201d Lois decided,  \u201cin case we have to leave in a hurry. I don\u2019t expect  we\u2019ll encounter any tigers, but we may be accused  of trespassing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure we will be,\u201d announced Judy as two  dark-coated figures strode down the road toward  them. \u201cYou drove right by a  NO TRESPASSING  sign,  and this isn\u2019t a welcoming committee coming to  meet us!\u201d \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho is Honey?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Judy's sister-in-law\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Judy's younger sister\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Judy's younger sister\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Judy's younger sister\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
