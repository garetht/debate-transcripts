      "background_text": "By H. B. Fyfe THE TALKATIVE\n\n TREE Dang vines! Beats all how some plants  have no manners\u2014but what do you expect,  when they used to be men! All  things considered\u2014the  obscure star, the undetermined  damage to the  stellar drive and the way the  small planet's murky atmosphere  defied precision scanners\u2014the  pilot made a reasonably  good landing. Despite  sour feelings for the space  service of Haurtoz, steward  Peter Kolin had to admit that  casualties might have been  far worse.\n\n\n Chief Steward Slichow led  his little command, less two  third-class ration keepers  thought to have been trapped  in the lower hold, to a point  two hundred meters from the  steaming hull of the Peace  State . He lined them up as if  on parade. Kolin made himself  inconspicuous.\n\n\n \"Since the crew will be on  emergency watches repairing  the damage,\" announced the  Chief in clipped, aggressive  tones, \"I have volunteered my  section for preliminary scouting,  as is suitable. It may be  useful to discover temporary  sources in this area of natural  foods.\"\n\n\n Volunteered HIS section!  thought Kolin rebelliously.\n\n\n Like the Supreme Director  of Haurtoz! Being conscripted  into this idiotic space fleet  that never fights is bad  enough without a tin god on  jets like Slichow!\n\n\n Prudently, he did not express  this resentment overtly.\n\n\n His well-schooled features  revealed no trace of the idea\u2014or  of any other idea. The  Planetary State of Haurtoz  had been organized some fifteen  light-years from old  Earth, but many of the home  world's less kindly techniques  had been employed. Lack of  complete loyalty to the state  was likely to result in a siege  of treatment that left the subject  suitably \"re-personalized.\"  Kolin had heard of instances  wherein mere unenthusiastic  posture had betrayed  intentions to harbor  treasonable thoughts.\n\n\n \"You will scout in five details  of three persons each,\"  Chief Slichow said. \"Every  hour, each detail will send  one person in to report, and  he will be replaced by one of  the five I shall keep here to  issue rations.\"\n\n\n Kolin permitted himself to  wonder when anyone might  get some rest, but assumed a  mildly willing look. (Too eager  an attitude could arouse  suspicion of disguising an improper  viewpoint.) The maintenance  of a proper viewpoint  was a necessity if the Planetary  State were to survive  the hostile plots of Earth and  the latter's decadent colonies.  That, at least, was the official  line.\n\n\n Kolin found himself in a  group with Jak Ammet, a  third cook, and Eva Yrtok,  powdered foods storekeeper.  Since the crew would be eating  packaged rations during  repairs, Yrtok could be spared  to command a scout detail.\n\n\n Each scout was issued a  rocket pistol and a plastic water  tube. Chief Slichow emphasized  that the keepers of  rations could hardly, in an  emergency, give even the appearance  of favoring themselves  in regard to food. They  would go without. Kolin  maintained a standard expression  as the Chief's sharp  stare measured them.\n\n\n Yrtok, a dark, lean-faced  girl, led the way with a quiet  monosyllable. She carried the  small radio they would be  permitted to use for messages  of utmost urgency. Ammet  followed, and Kolin brought  up the rear. To  reach their assigned  sector, they had to climb  a forbidding ridge of rock  within half a kilometer. Only  a sparse creeper grew along  their way, its elongated leaves  shimmering with bronze-green  reflections against a  stony surface; but when they  topped the ridge a thick forest  was in sight.\n\n\n Yrtok and Ammet paused  momentarily before descending.\n\n\n Kolin shared their sense of  isolation. They would be out  of sight of authority and responsible  for their own actions.  It was a strange sensation.\n\n\n They marched down into  the valley at a brisk pace, becoming  more aware of the  clouds and atmospheric haze.  Distant objects seemed  blurred by the mist, taking on  a somber, brooding grayness.  For all Kolin could tell, he  and the others were isolated  in a world bounded by the  rocky ridge behind them and  a semi-circle of damp trees  and bushes several hundred  meters away. He suspected  that the hills rising mistily  ahead were part of a continuous  slope, but could not be  sure.\n\n\n Yrtok led the way along  the most nearly level ground.  Low creepers became more  plentiful, interspersed with  scrubby thickets of tangled,  spike-armored bushes. Occasionally,  small flying things  flickered among the foliage.  Once, a shrub puffed out an  enormous cloud of tiny  spores.\n\n\n \"Be a job to find anything  edible here,\" grunted Ammet,  and Kolin agreed.\n\n\n Finally, after a longer hike  than he had anticipated, they  approached the edge of the  deceptively distant forest.  Yrtok paused to examine some  purple berries glistening dangerously  on a low shrub. Kolin  regarded the trees with  misgiving.\n\n\n \"Looks as tough to get  through as a tropical jungle,\"  he remarked.\n\n\n \"I think the stuff puts out  shoots that grow back into  the ground to root as they  spread,\" said the woman.  \"Maybe we can find a way  through.\"\n\n\n In two or three minutes,  they reached the abrupt border  of the odd-looking trees.\n\n\n Except for one thick  trunked giant, all of them  were about the same height.  They craned their necks to estimate  the altitude of the  monster, but the top was hidden  by the wide spread of  branches. The depths behind  it looked dark and impenetrable.\n\n\n \"We'd better explore along  the edge,\" decided Yrtok.  \"Ammet, now is the time to  go back and tell the Chief  which way we're\u2014  Ammet!  \"\n\n\n Kolin looked over his shoulder.  Fifty meters away, Ammet  sat beside the bush with  the purple berries, utterly  relaxed.\n\n\n \"He must have tasted  some!\" exclaimed Kolin. \"I'll  see how he is.\"\n\n\n He ran back to the cook and  shook him by the shoulder.  Ammet's head lolled loosely  to one side. His rather heavy  features were vacant, lending  him a doped appearance. Kolin  straightened up and beckoned  to Yrtok.\n\n\n For some reason, he had  trouble attracting her attention.  Then he noticed that she  was kneeling.\n\n\n \"Hope she didn't eat some  stupid thing too!\" he grumbled,  trotting back.\n\n\n As he reached her, whatever  Yrtok was examining  came to life and scooted into  the underbrush with a flash  of greenish fur. All Kolin  saw was that it had several  legs too many.\n\n\n He pulled Yrtok to her  feet. She pawed at him weakly,  eyes as vacant as Ammet's.  When he let go in sudden  horror, she folded gently to  the ground. She lay comfortably  on her side, twitching  one hand as if to brush something  away.\n\n\n When she began to smile  dreamily, Kolin backed away. The  corners of his mouth  felt oddly stiff; they had  involuntarily drawn back to  expose his clenched teeth. He  glanced warily about, but  nothing appeared to threaten  him.\n\n\n \"It's time to end this scout,\"  he told himself. \"It's dangerous.  One good look and I'm  jetting off! What I need is  an easy tree to climb.\"\n\n\n He considered the massive  giant. Soaring thirty or forty  meters into the thin fog and  dwarfing other growth, it  seemed the most promising  choice.\n\n\n At first, Kolin saw no way,  but then the network of vines  clinging to the rugged trunk  suggested a route. He tried  his weight gingerly, then began  to climb.\n\n\n \"I should have brought  Yrtok's radio,\" he muttered.  \"Oh, well, I can take it when  I come down, if she hasn't  snapped out of her spell by  then. Funny \u2026 I wonder if  that green thing bit her.\"\n\n\n Footholds were plentiful  among the interlaced lianas.  Kolin progressed rapidly.  When he reached the first  thick limbs, twice head  height, he felt safer.\n\n\n Later, at what he hoped was  the halfway mark, he hooked  one knee over a branch and  paused to wipe sweat from his  eyes. Peering down, he discovered  the ground to be obscured  by foliage.\n\n\n \"I should have checked  from down there to see how  open the top is,\" he mused.  \"I wonder how the view will  be from up there?\"\n\n\n \"Depends on what you're  looking for, Sonny!\" something  remarked in a soughing wheeze.\n\n\n Kolin, slipping, grabbed  desperately for the branch.  His fingers clutched a handful  of twigs and leaves, which  just barely supported him until  he regained a grip with  the other hand.\n\n\n The branch quivered resentfully  under him.\n\n\n \"Careful, there!\" whooshed  the eerie voice. \"It took me  all summer to grow those!\"\n\n\n Kolin could feel the skin  crawling along his backbone.\n\n\n \"Who  are  you?\" he gasped.\n\n\n The answering sigh of  laughter gave him a distinct  chill despite its suggestion of  amiability.\n\n\n \"Name's Johnny Ashlew.  Kinda thought you'd start  with  what  I am. Didn't figure  you'd ever seen a man grown  into a tree before.\"\n\n\n Kolin looked about, seeing  little but leaves and fog.\n\n\n \"I have to climb down,\" he  told himself in a reasonable  tone. \"It's bad enough that the  other two passed out without  me going space happy too.\"\n\n\n \"What's your hurry?\" demanded  the voice. \"I can talk  to you just as easy all the way  down, you know. Airholes in  my bark\u2014I'm not like an  Earth tree.\"\n\n\n Kolin examined the bark of  the crotch in which he sat. It  did seem to have assorted  holes and hollows in its rough  surface.\n\n\n \"I never saw an Earth tree,\"  he admitted. \"We came from  Haurtoz.\"\n\n\n \"Where's that? Oh, never  mind\u2014some little planet. I  don't bother with them all,  since I came here and found  out I could be anything I  wanted.\"\n\n\n \"What do you mean, anything  you wanted?\" asked  Kolin, testing the firmness of  a vertical vine. \"Just  what I said,\" continued  the voice, sounding  closer in his ear as his  cheek brushed the ridged bark  of the tree trunk. \"And, if  I do have to remind you, it  would be nicer if you said  'Mr. Ashlew,' considering my  age.\"\n\n\n \"Your age? How old\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"Can't really count it in  Earth years any more. Lost  track. I always figured bein'  a tree was a nice, peaceful  life; and when I remembered  how long some of them live,  that settled it. Sonny, this  world ain't all it looks like.\"\n\n\n \"It isn't, Mr. Ashlew?\"  asked Kolin, twisting about  in an effort to see what the  higher branches might hide.\n\n\n \"Nope. Most everything  here is run by the Life\u2014that  is, by the thing that first  grew big enough to do some  thinking, and set its roots  down all over until it had  control. That's the outskirts  of it down below.\"\n\n\n \"The other trees? That jungle?\"\n\n\n \"It's more'n a jungle, Sonny.  When I landed here, along  with the others from the Arcturan Spark , the planet  looked pretty empty to me,  just like it must have to\u2014Watch  it, there, Boy! If I  didn't twist that branch over  in time, you'd be bouncing off  my roots right now!\"\n\n\n \"Th-thanks!\" grunted Kolin,  hanging on grimly.\n\n\n \"Doggone vine!\" commented  the windy whisper. \"  He  ain't one of my crowd. Landed  years later in a ship from  some star towards the center  of the galaxy. You should  have seen his looks before  the Life got in touch with his  mind and set up a mental field  to help him change form. He  looks twice as good as a  vine!\"\n\n\n \"He's very handy,\" agreed  Kolin politely. He groped for  a foothold.\n\n\n \"Well \u2026 matter of fact, I  can't get through to him  much, even with the Life's  mental field helping. Guess  he started living with a different  way of thinking. It  burns me. I thought of being  a tree, and then he came along  to take advantage of it!\"\n\n\n Kolin braced himself securely  to stretch tiring muscles.\n\n\n \"Maybe I'd better stay a  while,\" he muttered. \"I don't  know where I am.\"\n\n\n \"You're about fifty feet  up,\" the sighing voice informed  him. \"You ought to  let me tell you how the Life  helps you change form. You  don't  have  to be a tree.\"\n\n\n \"No?\"\n\n\n \"  Uh  -uh! Some of the boys  that landed with me wanted  to get around and see things.  Lots changed to animals or  birds. One even stayed a man\u2014on  the outside anyway.  Most of them have to change  as the bodies wear out, which  I don't, and some made bad  mistakes tryin' to be things  they saw on other planets.\"\n\n\n \"I wouldn't want to do  that, Mr. Ashlew.\"\n\n\n \"There's just one thing.  The Life don't like taking  chances on word about this  place gettin' around. It sorta  believes in peace and quiet.  You might not get back to  your ship in any form that  could tell tales.\"\n\n\n \"Listen!\" Kolin blurted  out. \"I wasn't so much enjoying  being what I was that  getting back matters to me!\"\n\n\n \"Don't like your home planet,  whatever the name was?\"\n\n\n \"Haurtoz. It's a rotten  place. A Planetary State! You  have to think and even look  the way that's standard thirty  hours a day, asleep or  awake. You get scared to  sleep for fear you might  dream  treason and they'd find  out somehow.\"\n\n\n \"Whooeee! Heard about  them places. Must be tough  just to live.\"\n\n\n Suddenly, Kolin found himself  telling the tree about life  on Haurtoz, and of the officially  announced threats to  the Planetary State's planned  expansion. He dwelt upon the  desperation of having no  place to hide in case of trouble  with the authorities. A  multiple system of such  worlds was agonizing to  imagine. Somehow,  the oddity of  talking to a tree wore off.  Kolin heard opinions spouting  out which he had prudently  kept bottled up for  years.\n\n\n The more he talked and  stormed and complained, the  more relaxed he felt.\n\n\n \"If there was ever a fellow  ready for this planet,\" decided  the tree named Ashlew,  \"you're it, Sonny! Hang on  there while I signal the Life  by root!\"\n\n\n Kolin sensed a lack of direct  attention. The rustle  about him was natural, caused  by an ordinary breeze. He  noticed his hands shaking.\n\n\n \"Don't know what got into  me, talking that way to a  tree,\" he muttered. \"If Yrtok  snapped out of it and heard,  I'm as good as re-personalized  right now.\"\n\n\n As he brooded upon the  sorry choice of arousing a  search by hiding where he  was or going back to bluff  things out, the tree spoke.\n\n\n \"Maybe you're all set, Sonny.  The Life has been thinkin'  of learning about other  worlds. If you can think of a  safe form to jet off in, you  might make yourself a deal.  How'd you like to stay here?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" said Kolin.  \"The penalty for desertion\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Whoosh! Who'd find you?  You could be a bird, a tree,  even a cloud.\"\n\n\n Silenced but doubting, Kolin  permitted himself to try  the dream on for size.\n\n\n He considered what form  might most easily escape the  notice of search parties and  still be tough enough to live  a long time without renewal.  Another factor slipped into  his musings: mere hope of escape  was unsatisfying after  the outburst that had defined  his fuming hatred for Haurtoz.\n\n\n I'd better watch myself!  he  thought.  Don't drop diamonds  to grab at stars!\n\n\n \"What I wish I could do is  not just get away but get even  for the way they make us  live \u2026 the whole damn set-up.  They could just as easy make  peace with the Earth colonies.  You know why they  don't?\"\n\n\n \"Why?\" wheezed Ashlew.\n\n\n \"They're scared that without  talk of war, and scouting  for Earth fleets that never  come, people would have time  to think about the way they  have to live and who's running  things in the Planetary  State. Then the gravy train  would get blown up\u2014and I  mean blown up!\"\n\n\n The tree was silent for a  moment. Kolin felt the  branches stir meditatively.  Then Ashlew offered a suggestion.\n\n\n \"I could tell the Life your  side of it,\" he hissed. \"Once  in with us, you can always  make thinking connections,  no matter how far away.  Maybe you could make a deal  to kill two birds with one  stone, as they used to say on  Earth\u2026.\" Chief  Steward Slichow  paced up and down beside  the ration crate turned up to  serve him as a field desk. He  scowled in turn, impartially,  at his watch and at the weary  stewards of his headquarters  detail. The latter stumbled  about, stacking and distributing  small packets of emergency  rations.\n\n\n The line of crewmen released  temporarily from repair  work was transient as to  individuals but immutable as  to length. Slichow muttered  something profane about disregard  of orders as he glared  at the rocky ridges surrounding  the landing place.\n\n\n He was so intent upon planning  greetings with which to  favor the tardy scouting parties  that he failed to notice  the loose cloud drifting over  the ridge.\n\n\n It was tenuous, almost a  haze. Close examination  would have revealed it to be  made up of myriads of tiny  spores. They resembled those  cast forth by one of the  bushes Kolin's party had  passed. Along the edges, the  haze faded raggedly into thin  air, but the units evidently  formed a cohesive body. They  drifted together, approaching  the men as if taking intelligent  advantage of the breeze.\n\n\n One of Chief Slichow's  staggering flunkies, stealing  a few seconds of relaxation  on the pretext of dumping an  armful of light plastic packing,  wandered into the haze.\n\n\n He froze.\n\n\n After a few heartbeats, he  dropped the trash and stared  at ship and men as if he had  never seen either. A hail from  his master moved him.\n\n\n \"Coming, Chief!\" he called  but, returning at a moderate  pace, he murmured, \"My  name is Frazer. I'm a second  assistant steward. I'll think as  Unit One.\"\n\n\n Throughout the cloud of  spores, the mind formerly  known as Peter Kolin congratulated  itself upon its  choice of form.\n\n\n Nearer to the original  shape of the Life than Ashlew  got  , he thought.\n\n\n He paused to consider the  state of the tree named Ashlew,  half immortal but rooted  to one spot, unable to float on  a breeze or through space itself  on the pressure of light.  Especially, it was unable to  insinuate any part of itself  into the control center of another  form of life, as a second  spore was taking charge of  the body of Chief Slichow at  that very instant.\n\n\n There are not enough men  ,  thought Kolin.  Some of me  must drift through the airlock.  In space, I can spread  through the air system to the  command group.\n\n\n Repairs to the Peace State and the return to Haurtoz  passed like weeks to some of  the crew but like brief moments  in infinity to other  units. At last, the ship parted  the air above Headquarters  City and landed.\n\n\n The unit known as Captain  Theodor Kessel hesitated before  descending the ramp. He  surveyed the field, the city  and the waiting team of inspecting  officers.\n\n\n \"Could hardly be better,  could it?\" he chuckled to the  companion unit called Security  Officer Tarth.\n\n\n \"Hardly, sir. All ready for  the liberation of Haurtoz.\"\n\n\n \"Reformation of the Planetary  State,\" mused the captain,  smiling dreamily as he  grasped the handrail. \"And  then\u2014formation of the Planetary  Mind!\" END Transcriber's Note: This e-text was produced from  Worlds of If January 1962  .

B. Fyfe THE TALKATIVE\n\n TREE Dang vines! Beats all how some plants  have no manners\u2014but what do you expect,  when they used to be men! All  things considered\u2014the  obscure star, the undetermined  damage to the  stellar drive and the way the  small planet's murky atmosphere  defied precision scanners\u2014the  pilot made a reasonably  good landing. Despite  sour feelings for the space  service of Haurtoz, steward  Peter Kolin had to admit that  casualties might have been  far worse.\n\n\n Chief Steward Slichow led  his little command, less two  third-class ration keepers  thought to have been trapped  in the lower hold, to a point  two hundred meters from the  steaming hull of the Peace  State . He lined them up as if  on parade. Kolin made himself  inconspicuous.\n\n\n \"Since the crew will be on  emergency watches repairing  the damage,\" announced the  Chief in clipped, aggressive  tones, \"I have volunteered my  section for preliminary scouting,  as is suitable. It may be  useful to discover temporary  sources in this area of natural  foods.\"\n\n\n Volunteered HIS section!  thought Kolin rebelliously.\n\n\n Like the Supreme Director  of Haurtoz! Being conscripted  into this idiotic space fleet  that never fights is bad  enough without a tin god on  jets like Slichow!\n\n\n Prudently, he did not express  this resentment overtly.\n\n\n His well-schooled features  revealed no trace of the idea\u2014or  of any other idea. The  Planetary State of Haurtoz  had been organized some fifteen  light-years from old  Earth, but many of the home  world's less kindly techniques  had been employed. Lack of  complete loyalty to the state  was likely to result in a siege  of treatment that left the subject  suitably \"re-personalized.\"  Kolin had heard of instances  wherein mere unenthusiastic  posture had betrayed  intentions to harbor  treasonable thoughts.\n\n\n \"You will scout in five details  of three persons each,\"  Chief Slichow said. \"Every  hour, each detail will send  one person in to report, and  he will be replaced by one of  the five I shall keep here to  issue rations.\"\n\n\n Kolin permitted himself to  wonder when anyone might  get some rest, but assumed a  mildly willing look. (Too eager  an attitude could arouse  suspicion of disguising an improper  viewpoint.) The maintenance  of a proper viewpoint  was a necessity if the Planetary  State were to survive  the hostile plots of Earth and  the latter's decadent colonies.  That, at least, was the official  line.\n\n\n Kolin found himself in a  group with Jak Ammet, a  third cook, and Eva Yrtok,  powdered foods storekeeper.  Since the crew would be eating  packaged rations during  repairs, Yrtok could be spared  to command a scout detail.\n\n\n Each scout was issued a  rocket pistol and a plastic water  tube. Chief Slichow emphasized  that the keepers of  rations could hardly, in an  emergency, give even the appearance  of favoring themselves  in regard to food. They  would go without. Kolin  maintained a standard expression  as the Chief's sharp  stare measured them.\n\n\n Yrtok, a dark, lean-faced  girl, led the way with a quiet  monosyllable. She carried the  small radio they would be  permitted to use for messages  of utmost urgency. Ammet  followed, and Kolin brought  up the rear. To  reach their assigned  sector, they had to climb  a forbidding ridge of rock  within half a kilometer. Only  a sparse creeper grew along  their way, its elongated leaves  shimmering with bronze-green  reflections against a  stony surface; but when they  topped the ridge a thick forest  was in sight.\n\n\n Yrtok and Ammet paused  momentarily before descending.\n\n\n Kolin shared their sense of  isolation. They would be out  of sight of authority and responsible  for their own actions.  It was a strange sensation.\n\n\n They marched down into  the valley at a brisk pace, becoming  more aware of the  clouds and atmospheric haze.  Distant objects seemed  blurred by the mist, taking on  a somber, brooding grayness.  For all Kolin could tell, he  and the others were isolated  in a world bounded by the  rocky ridge behind them and  a semi-circle of damp trees  and bushes several hundred  meters away. He suspected  that the hills rising mistily  ahead were part of a continuous  slope, but could not be  sure.\n\n\n Yrtok led the way along  the most nearly level ground.  Low creepers became more  plentiful, interspersed with  scrubby thickets of tangled,  spike-armored bushes. Occasionally,  small flying things  flickered among the foliage.  Once, a shrub puffed out an  enormous cloud of tiny  spores.\n\n\n \"Be a job to find anything  edible here,\" grunted Ammet,  and Kolin agreed.\n\n\n Finally, after a longer hike  than he had anticipated, they  approached the edge of the  deceptively distant forest.  Yrtok paused to examine some  purple berries glistening dangerously  on a low shrub. Kolin  regarded the trees with  misgiving.\n\n\n \"Looks as tough to get  through as a tropical jungle,\"  he remarked.\n\n\n \"I think the stuff puts out  shoots that grow back into  the ground to root as they  spread,\" said the woman.  \"Maybe we can find a way  through.\"\n\n\n In two or three minutes,  they reached the abrupt border  of the odd-looking trees.\n\n\n Except for one thick  trunked giant, all of them  were about the same height.  They craned their necks to estimate  the altitude of the  monster, but the top was hidden  by the wide spread of  branches. The depths behind  it looked dark and impenetrable.\n\n\n \"We'd better explore along  the edge,\" decided Yrtok.  \"Ammet, now is the time to  go back and tell the Chief  which way we're\u2014  Ammet!  \"\n\n\n Kolin looked over his shoulder.  Fifty meters away, Ammet  sat beside the bush with  the purple berries, utterly  relaxed.\n\n\n \"He must have tasted  some!\" exclaimed Kolin. \"I'll  see how he is.\"\n\n\n He ran back to the cook and  shook him by the shoulder.  Ammet's head lolled loosely  to one side. His rather heavy  features were vacant, lending  him a doped appearance. Kolin  straightened up and beckoned  to Yrtok.\n\n\n For some reason, he had  trouble attracting her attention.  Then he noticed that she  was kneeling.\n\n\n \"Hope she didn't eat some  stupid thing too!\" he grumbled,  trotting back.\n\n\n As he reached her, whatever  Yrtok was examining  came to life and scooted into  the underbrush with a flash  of greenish fur. All Kolin  saw was that it had several  legs too many.\n\n\n He pulled Yrtok to her  feet. She pawed at him weakly,  eyes as vacant as Ammet's.  When he let go in sudden  horror, she folded gently to  the ground. She lay comfortably  on her side, twitching  one hand as if to brush something  away.\n\n\n When she began to smile  dreamily, Kolin backed away. The  corners of his mouth  felt oddly stiff; they had  involuntarily drawn back to  expose his clenched teeth. He  glanced warily about, but  nothing appeared to threaten  him.\n\n\n \"It's time to end this scout,\"  he told himself. \"It's dangerous.  One good look and I'm  jetting off! What I need is  an easy tree to climb.\"\n\n\n He considered the massive  giant. Soaring thirty or forty  meters into the thin fog and  dwarfing other growth, it  seemed the most promising  choice.\n\n\n At first, Kolin saw no way,  but then the network of vines  clinging to the rugged trunk  suggested a route. He tried  his weight gingerly, then began  to climb.\n\n\n \"I should have brought  Yrtok's radio,\" he muttered.  \"Oh, well, I can take it when  I come down, if she hasn't  snapped out of her spell by  then. Funny \u2026 I wonder if  that green thing bit her.\"\n\n\n Footholds were plentiful  among the interlaced lianas.  Kolin progressed rapidly.  When he reached the first  thick limbs, twice head  height, he felt safer.\n\n\n Later, at what he hoped was  the halfway mark, he hooked  one knee over a branch and  paused to wipe sweat from his  eyes. Peering down, he discovered  the ground to be obscured  by foliage.\n\n\n \"I should have checked  from down there to see how  open the top is,\" he mused.  \"I wonder how the view will  be from up there?\"\n\n\n \"Depends on what you're  looking for, Sonny!\" something  remarked in a soughing wheeze.\n\n\n Kolin, slipping, grabbed  desperately for the branch.  His fingers clutched a handful  of twigs and leaves, which  just barely supported him until  he regained a grip with  the other hand.\n\n\n The branch quivered resentfully  under him.\n\n\n \"Careful, there!\" whooshed  the eerie voice. \"It took me  all summer to grow those!\"\n\n\n Kolin could feel the skin  crawling along his backbone.\n\n\n \"Who  are  you?\" he gasped.\n\n\n The answering sigh of  laughter gave him a distinct  chill despite its suggestion of  amiability.\n\n\n \"Name's Johnny Ashlew.  Kinda thought you'd start  with  what  I am. Didn't figure  you'd ever seen a man grown  into a tree before.\"\n\n\n Kolin looked about, seeing  little but leaves and fog.\n\n\n \"I have to climb down,\" he  told himself in a reasonable  tone. \"It's bad enough that the  other two passed out without  me going space happy too.\"\n\n\n \"What's your hurry?\" demanded  the voice. \"I can talk  to you just as easy all the way  down, you know. Airholes in  my bark\u2014I'm not like an  Earth tree.\"\n\n\n Kolin examined the bark of  the crotch in which he sat. It  did seem to have assorted  holes and hollows in its rough  surface.\n\n\n \"I never saw an Earth tree,\"  he admitted. \"We came from  Haurtoz.\"\n\n\n \"Where's that? Oh, never  mind\u2014some little planet. I  don't bother with them all,  since I came here and found  out I could be anything I  wanted.\"\n\n\n \"What do you mean, anything  you wanted?\" asked  Kolin, testing the firmness of  a vertical vine. \"Just  what I said,\" continued  the voice, sounding  closer in his ear as his  cheek brushed the ridged bark  of the tree trunk. \"And, if  I do have to remind you, it  would be nicer if you said  'Mr. Ashlew,' considering my  age.\"\n\n\n \"Your age? How old\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"Can't really count it in  Earth years any more. Lost  track. I always figured bein'  a tree was a nice, peaceful  life; and when I remembered  how long some of them live,  that settled it. Sonny, this  world ain't all it looks like.\"\n\n\n \"It isn't, Mr. Ashlew?\"  asked Kolin, twisting about  in an effort to see what the  higher branches might hide.\n\n\n \"Nope. Most everything  here is run by the Life\u2014that  is, by the thing that first  grew big enough to do some  thinking, and set its roots  down all over until it had  control. That's the outskirts  of it down below.\"\n\n\n \"The other trees? That jungle?\"\n\n\n \"It's more'n a jungle, Sonny.  When I landed here, along  with the others from the Arcturan Spark , the planet  looked pretty empty to me,  just like it must have to\u2014Watch  it, there, Boy! If I  didn't twist that branch over  in time, you'd be bouncing off  my roots right now!\"\n\n\n \"Th-thanks!\" grunted Kolin,  hanging on grimly.\n\n\n \"Doggone vine!\" commented  the windy whisper. \"  He  ain't one of my crowd. Landed  years later in a ship from  some star towards the center  of the galaxy. You should  have seen his looks before  the Life got in touch with his  mind and set up a mental field  to help him change form. He  looks twice as good as a  vine!\"\n\n\n \"He's very handy,\" agreed  Kolin politely. He groped for  a foothold.\n\n\n \"Well \u2026 matter of fact, I  can't get through to him  much, even with the Life's  mental field helping. Guess  he started living with a different  way of thinking. It  burns me. I thought of being  a tree, and then he came along  to take advantage of it!\"\n\n\n Kolin braced himself securely  to stretch tiring muscles.\n\n\n \"Maybe I'd better stay a  while,\" he muttered. \"I don't  know where I am.\"\n\n\n \"You're about fifty feet  up,\" the sighing voice informed  him. \"You ought to  let me tell you how the Life  helps you change form. You  don't  have  to be a tree.\"\n\n\n \"No?\"\n\n\n \"  Uh  -uh! Some of the boys  that landed with me wanted  to get around and see things.  Lots changed to animals or  birds. One even stayed a man\u2014on  the outside anyway.  Most of them have to change  as the bodies wear out, which  I don't, and some made bad  mistakes tryin' to be things  they saw on other planets.\"\n\n\n \"I wouldn't want to do  that, Mr. Ashlew.\"\n\n\n \"There's just one thing.  The Life don't like taking  chances on word about this  place gettin' around. It sorta  believes in peace and quiet.  You might not get back to  your ship in any form that  could tell tales.\"\n\n\n \"Listen!\" Kolin blurted  out. \"I wasn't so much enjoying  being what I was that  getting back matters to me!\"\n\n\n \"Don't like your home planet,  whatever the name was?\"\n\n\n \"Haurtoz. It's a rotten  place. A Planetary State! You  have to think and even look  the way that's standard thirty  hours a day, asleep or  awake. You get scared to  sleep for fear you might  dream  treason and they'd find  out somehow.\"\n\n\n \"Whooeee! Heard about  them places. Must be tough  just to live.\"\n\n\n Suddenly, Kolin found himself  telling the tree about life  on Haurtoz, and of the officially  announced threats to  the Planetary State's planned  expansion. He dwelt upon the  desperation of having no  place to hide in case of trouble  with the authorities. A  multiple system of such  worlds was agonizing to  imagine. Somehow,  the oddity of  talking to a tree wore off.  Kolin heard opinions spouting  out which he had prudently  kept bottled up for  years.\n\n\n The more he talked and  stormed and complained, the  more relaxed he felt.\n\n\n \"If there was ever a fellow  ready for this planet,\" decided  the tree named Ashlew,  \"you're it, Sonny! Hang on  there while I signal the Life  by root!\"\n\n\n Kolin sensed a lack of direct  attention. The rustle  about him was natural, caused  by an ordinary breeze. He  noticed his hands shaking.\n\n\n \"Don't know what got into  me, talking that way to a  tree,\" he muttered. \"If Yrtok  snapped out of it and heard,  I'm as good as re-personalized  right now.\"\n\n\n As he brooded upon the  sorry choice of arousing a  search by hiding where he  was or going back to bluff  things out, the tree spoke.\n\n\n \"Maybe you're all set, Sonny.  The Life has been thinkin'  of learning about other  worlds. If you can think of a  safe form to jet off in, you  might make yourself a deal.  How'd you like to stay here?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" said Kolin.  \"The penalty for desertion\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Whoosh! Who'd find you?  You could be a bird, a tree,  even a cloud.\"\n\n\n Silenced but doubting, Kolin  permitted himself to try  the dream on for size.\n\n\n He considered what form  might most easily escape the  notice of search parties and  still be tough enough to live  a long time without renewal.  Another factor slipped into  his musings: mere hope of escape  was unsatisfying after  the outburst that had defined  his fuming hatred for Haurtoz.\n\n\n I'd better watch myself!  he  thought.  Don't drop diamonds  to grab at stars!\n\n\n \"What I wish I could do is  not just get away but get even  for the way they make us  live \u2026 the whole damn set-up.  They could just as easy make  peace with the Earth colonies.  You know why they  don't?\"\n\n\n \"Why?\" wheezed Ashlew.\n\n\n \"They're scared that without  talk of war, and scouting  for Earth fleets that never  come, people would have time  to think about the way they  have to live and who's running  things in the Planetary  State. Then the gravy train  would get blown up\u2014and I  mean blown up!\"\n\n\n The tree was silent for a  moment. Kolin felt the  branches stir meditatively.  Then Ashlew offered a suggestion.\n\n\n \"I could tell the Life your  side of it,\" he hissed. \"Once  in with us, you can always  make thinking connections,  no matter how far away.  Maybe you could make a deal  to kill two birds with one  stone, as they used to say on  Earth\u2026.\" Chief  Steward Slichow  paced up and down beside  the ration crate turned up to  serve him as a field desk. He  scowled in turn, impartially,  at his watch and at the weary  stewards of his headquarters  detail. The latter stumbled  about, stacking and distributing  small packets of emergency  rations.\n\n\n The line of crewmen released  temporarily from repair  work was transient as to  individuals but immutable as  to length. Slichow muttered  something profane about disregard  of orders as he glared  at the rocky ridges surrounding  the landing place.\n\n\n He was so intent upon planning  greetings with which to  favor the tardy scouting parties  that he failed to notice  the loose cloud drifting over  the ridge.\n\n\n It was tenuous, almost a  haze. Close examination  would have revealed it to be  made up of myriads of tiny  spores. They resembled those  cast forth by one of the  bushes Kolin's party had  passed. Along the edges, the  haze faded raggedly into thin  air, but the units evidently  formed a cohesive body. They  drifted together, approaching  the men as if taking intelligent  advantage of the breeze.\n\n\n One of Chief Slichow's  staggering flunkies, stealing  a few seconds of relaxation  on the pretext of dumping an  armful of light plastic packing,  wandered into the haze.\n\n\n He froze.\n\n\n After a few heartbeats, he  dropped the trash and stared  at ship and men as if he had  never seen either. A hail from  his master moved him.\n\n\n \"Coming, Chief!\" he called  but, returning at a moderate  pace, he murmured, \"My  name is Frazer. I'm a second  assistant steward. I'll think as  Unit One.\"\n\n\n Throughout the cloud of  spores, the mind formerly  known as Peter Kolin congratulated  itself upon its  choice of form.\n\n\n Nearer to the original  shape of the Life than Ashlew  got  , he thought.\n\n\n He paused to consider the  state of the tree named Ashlew,  half immortal but rooted  to one spot, unable to float on  a breeze or through space itself  on the pressure of light.  Especially, it was unable to  insinuate any part of itself  into the control center of another  form of life, as a second  spore was taking charge of  the body of Chief Slichow at  that very instant.\n\n\n There are not enough men  ,  thought Kolin.  Some of me  must drift through the airlock.  In space, I can spread  through the air system to the  command group.\n\n\n Repairs to the Peace State and the return to Haurtoz  passed like weeks to some of  the crew but like brief moments  in infinity to other  units. At last, the ship parted  the air above Headquarters  City and landed.\n\n\n The unit known as Captain  Theodor Kessel hesitated before  descending the ramp. He  surveyed the field, the city  and the waiting team of inspecting  officers.\n\n\n \"Could hardly be better,  could it?\" he chuckled to the  companion unit called Security  Officer Tarth.\n\n\n \"Hardly, sir. All ready for  the liberation of Haurtoz.\"\n\n\n \"Reformation of the Planetary  State,\" mused the captain,  smiling dreamily as he  grasped the handrail. \"And  then\u2014formation of the Planetary  Mind!\" END Transcriber's Note: This e-text was produced from  Worlds of If January 1962  .

B. Fyfe THE TALKATIVE\n\n TREE Dang vines! Beats all how some plants  have no manners\u2014but what do you expect,  when they used to be men! All  things considered\u2014the  obscure star, the undetermined  damage to the  stellar drive and the way the  small planet's murky atmosphere  defied precision scanners\u2014the  pilot made a reasonably  good landing. Despite  sour feelings for the space  service of Haurtoz, steward  Peter Kolin had to admit that  casualties might have been  far worse.\n\n\n Chief Steward Slichow led  his little command, less two  third-class ration keepers  thought to have been trapped  in the lower hold, to a point  two hundred meters from the  steaming hull of the Peace  State . He lined them up as if  on parade. Kolin made himself  inconspicuous.\n\n\n \"Since the crew will be on  emergency watches repairing  the damage,\" announced the  Chief in clipped, aggressive  tones, \"I have volunteered my  section for preliminary scouting,  as is suitable. It may be  useful to discover temporary  sources in this area of natural  foods.\"\n\n\n Volunteered HIS section!  thought Kolin rebelliously.\n\n\n Like the Supreme Director  of Haurtoz! Being conscripted  into this idiotic space fleet  that never fights is bad  enough without a tin god on  jets like Slichow!\n\n\n Prudently, he did not express  this resentment overtly.\n\n\n His well-schooled features  revealed no trace of the idea\u2014or  of any other idea. The  Planetary State of Haurtoz  had been organized some fifteen  light-years from old  Earth, but many of the home  world's less kindly techniques  had been employed. Lack of  complete loyalty to the state  was likely to result in a siege  of treatment that left the subject  suitably \"re-personalized.\"  Kolin had heard of instances  wherein mere unenthusiastic  posture had betrayed  intentions to harbor  treasonable thoughts.\n\n\n \"You will scout in five details  of three persons each,\"  Chief Slichow said. \"Every  hour, each detail will send  one person in to report, and  he will be replaced by one of  the five I shall keep here to  issue rations.\"\n\n\n Kolin permitted himself to  wonder when anyone might  get some rest, but assumed a  mildly willing look. (Too eager  an attitude could arouse  suspicion of disguising an improper  viewpoint.) The maintenance  of a proper viewpoint  was a necessity if the Planetary  State were to survive  the hostile plots of Earth and  the latter's decadent colonies.  That, at least, was the official  line.\n\n\n Kolin found himself in a  group with Jak Ammet, a  third cook, and Eva Yrtok,  powdered foods storekeeper.  Since the crew would be eating  packaged rations during  repairs, Yrtok could be spared  to command a scout detail.\n\n\n Each scout was issued a  rocket pistol and a plastic water  tube. Chief Slichow emphasized  that the keepers of  rations could hardly, in an  emergency, give even the appearance  of favoring themselves  in regard to food. They  would go without. Kolin  maintained a standard expression  as the Chief's sharp  stare measured them.\n\n\n Yrtok, a dark, lean-faced  girl, led the way with a quiet  monosyllable. She carried the  small radio they would be  permitted to use for messages  of utmost urgency. Ammet  followed, and Kolin brought  up the rear. To  reach their assigned  sector, they had to climb  a forbidding ridge of rock  within half a kilometer. Only  a sparse creeper grew along  their way, its elongated leaves  shimmering with bronze-green  reflections against a  stony surface; but when they  topped the ridge a thick forest  was in sight.\n\n\n Yrtok and Ammet paused  momentarily before descending.\n\n\n Kolin shared their sense of  isolation. They would be out  of sight of authority and responsible  for their own actions.  It was a strange sensation.\n\n\n They marched down into  the valley at a brisk pace, becoming  more aware of the  clouds and atmospheric haze.  Distant objects seemed  blurred by the mist, taking on  a somber, brooding grayness.  For all Kolin could tell, he  and the others were isolated  in a world bounded by the  rocky ridge behind them and  a semi-circle of damp trees  and bushes several hundred  meters away. He suspected  that the hills rising mistily  ahead were part of a continuous  slope, but could not be  sure.\n\n\n Yrtok led the way along  the most nearly level ground.  Low creepers became more  plentiful, interspersed with  scrubby thickets of tangled,  spike-armored bushes. Occasionally,  small flying things  flickered among the foliage.  Once, a shrub puffed out an  enormous cloud of tiny  spores.\n\n\n \"Be a job to find anything  edible here,\" grunted Ammet,  and Kolin agreed.\n\n\n Finally, after a longer hike  than he had anticipated, they  approached the edge of the  deceptively distant forest.  Yrtok paused to examine some  purple berries glistening dangerously  on a low shrub. Kolin  regarded the trees with  misgiving.\n\n\n \"Looks as tough to get  through as a tropical jungle,\"  he remarked.\n\n\n \"I think the stuff puts out  shoots that grow back into  the ground to root as they  spread,\" said the woman.  \"Maybe we can find a way  through.\"\n\n\n In two or three minutes,  they reached the abrupt border  of the odd-looking trees.\n\n\n Except for one thick  trunked giant, all of them  were about the same height.  They craned their necks to estimate  the altitude of the  monster, but the top was hidden  by the wide spread of  branches. The depths behind  it looked dark and impenetrable.\n\n\n \"We'd better explore along  the edge,\" decided Yrtok.  \"Ammet, now is the time to  go back and tell the Chief  which way we're\u2014  Ammet!  \"\n\n\n Kolin looked over his shoulder.  Fifty meters away, Ammet  sat beside the bush with  the purple berries, utterly  relaxed.\n\n\n \"He must have tasted  some!\" exclaimed Kolin. \"I'll  see how he is.\"\n\n\n He ran back to the cook and  shook him by the shoulder.  Ammet's head lolled loosely  to one side. His rather heavy  features were vacant, lending  him a doped appearance. Kolin  straightened up and beckoned  to Yrtok.\n\n\n For some reason, he had  trouble attracting her attention.  Then he noticed that she  was kneeling.\n\n\n \"Hope she didn't eat some  stupid thing too!\" he grumbled,  trotting back.\n\n\n As he reached her, whatever  Yrtok was examining  came to life and scooted into  the underbrush with a flash  of greenish fur. All Kolin  saw was that it had several  legs too many.\n\n\n He pulled Yrtok to her  feet. She pawed at him weakly,  eyes as vacant as Ammet's.  When he let go in sudden  horror, she folded gently to  the ground. She lay comfortably  on her side, twitching  one hand as if to brush something  away.\n\n\n When she began to smile  dreamily, Kolin backed away. The  corners of his mouth  felt oddly stiff; they had  involuntarily drawn back to  expose his clenched teeth. He  glanced warily about, but  nothing appeared to threaten  him.\n\n\n \"It's time to end this scout,\"  he told himself. \"It's dangerous.  One good look and I'm  jetting off! What I need is  an easy tree to climb.\"\n\n\n He considered the massive  giant. Soaring thirty or forty  meters into the thin fog and  dwarfing other growth, it  seemed the most promising  choice.\n\n\n At first, Kolin saw no way,  but then the network of vines  clinging to the rugged trunk  suggested a route. He tried  his weight gingerly, then began  to climb.\n\n\n \"I should have brought  Yrtok's radio,\" he muttered.  \"Oh, well, I can take it when  I come down, if she hasn't  snapped out of her spell by  then. Funny \u2026 I wonder if  that green thing bit her.\"\n\n\n Footholds were plentiful  among the interlaced lianas.  Kolin progressed rapidly.  When he reached the first  thick limbs, twice head  height, he felt safer.\n\n\n Later, at what he hoped was  the halfway mark, he hooked  one knee over a branch and  paused to wipe sweat from his  eyes. Peering down, he discovered  the ground to be obscured  by foliage.\n\n\n \"I should have checked  from down there to see how  open the top is,\" he mused.  \"I wonder how the view will  be from up there?\"\n\n\n \"Depends on what you're  looking for, Sonny!\" something  remarked in a soughing wheeze.\n\n\n Kolin, slipping, grabbed  desperately for the branch.  His fingers clutched a handful  of twigs and leaves, which  just barely supported him until  he regained a grip with  the other hand.\n\n\n The branch quivered resentfully  under him.\n\n\n \"Careful, there!\" whooshed  the eerie voice. \"It took me  all summer to grow those!\"\n\n\n Kolin could feel the skin  crawling along his backbone.\n\n\n \"Who  are  you?\" he gasped.\n\n\n The answering sigh of  laughter gave him a distinct  chill despite its suggestion of  amiability.\n\n\n \"Name's Johnny Ashlew.  Kinda thought you'd start  with  what  I am. Didn't figure  you'd ever seen a man grown  into a tree before.\"\n\n\n Kolin looked about, seeing  little but leaves and fog.\n\n\n \"I have to climb down,\" he  told himself in a reasonable  tone. \"It's bad enough that the  other two passed out without  me going space happy too.\"\n\n\n \"What's your hurry?\" demanded  the voice. \"I can talk  to you just as easy all the way  down, you know. Airholes in  my bark\u2014I'm not like an  Earth tree.\"\n\n\n Kolin examined the bark of  the crotch in which he sat. It  did seem to have assorted  holes and hollows in its rough  surface.\n\n\n \"I never saw an Earth tree,\"  he admitted. \"We came from  Haurtoz.\"\n\n\n \"Where's that? Oh, never  mind\u2014some little planet. I  don't bother with them all,  since I came here and found  out I could be anything I  wanted.\"\n\n\n \"What do you mean, anything  you wanted?\" asked  Kolin, testing the firmness of  a vertical vine. \"Just  what I said,\" continued  the voice, sounding  closer in his ear as his  cheek brushed the ridged bark  of the tree trunk. \"And, if  I do have to remind you, it  would be nicer if you said  'Mr. Ashlew,' considering my  age.\"\n\n\n \"Your age? How old\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"Can't really count it in  Earth years any more. Lost  track. I always figured bein'  a tree was a nice, peaceful  life; and when I remembered  how long some of them live,  that settled it. Sonny, this  world ain't all it looks like.\"\n\n\n \"It isn't, Mr. Ashlew?\"  asked Kolin, twisting about  in an effort to see what the  higher branches might hide.\n\n\n \"Nope. Most everything  here is run by the Life\u2014that  is, by the thing that first  grew big enough to do some  thinking, and set its roots  down all over until it had  control. That's the outskirts  of it down below.\"\n\n\n \"The other trees? That jungle?\"\n\n\n \"It's more'n a jungle, Sonny.  When I landed here, along  with the others from the Arcturan Spark , the planet  looked pretty empty to me,  just like it must have to\u2014Watch  it, there, Boy! If I  didn't twist that branch over  in time, you'd be bouncing off  my roots right now!\"\n\n\n \"Th-thanks!\" grunted Kolin,  hanging on grimly.\n\n\n \"Doggone vine!\" commented  the windy whisper. \"  He  ain't one of my crowd. Landed  years later in a ship from  some star towards the center  of the galaxy. You should  have seen his looks before  the Life got in touch with his  mind and set up a mental field  to help him change form. He  looks twice as good as a  vine!\"\n\n\n \"He's very handy,\" agreed  Kolin politely. He groped for  a foothold.\n\n\n \"Well \u2026 matter of fact, I  can't get through to him  much, even with the Life's  mental field helping. Guess  he started living with a different  way of thinking. It  burns me. I thought of being  a tree, and then he came along  to take advantage of it!\"\n\n\n Kolin braced himself securely  to stretch tiring muscles.\n\n\n \"Maybe I'd better stay a  while,\" he muttered. \"I don't  know where I am.\"\n\n\n \"You're about fifty feet  up,\" the sighing voice informed  him. \"You ought to  let me tell you how the Life  helps you change form. You  don't  have  to be a tree.\"\n\n\n \"No?\"\n\n\n \"  Uh  -uh! Some of the boys  that landed with me wanted  to get around and see things.  Lots changed to animals or  birds. One even stayed a man\u2014on  the outside anyway.  Most of them have to change  as the bodies wear out, which  I don't, and some made bad  mistakes tryin' to be things  they saw on other planets.\"\n\n\n \"I wouldn't want to do  that, Mr. Ashlew.\"\n\n\n \"There's just one thing.  The Life don't like taking  chances on word about this  place gettin' around. It sorta  believes in peace and quiet.  You might not get back to  your ship in any form that  could tell tales.\"\n\n\n \"Listen!\" Kolin blurted  out. \"I wasn't so much enjoying  being what I was that  getting back matters to me!\"\n\n\n \"Don't like your home planet,  whatever the name was?\"\n\n\n \"Haurtoz. It's a rotten  place. A Planetary State! You  have to think and even look  the way that's standard thirty  hours a day, asleep or  awake. You get scared to  sleep for fear you might  dream  treason and they'd find  out somehow.\"\n\n\n \"Whooeee! Heard about  them places. Must be tough  just to live.\"\n\n\n Suddenly, Kolin found himself  telling the tree about life  on Haurtoz, and of the officially  announced threats to  the Planetary State's planned  expansion. He dwelt upon the  desperation of having no  place to hide in case of trouble  with the authorities. A  multiple system of such  worlds was agonizing to  imagine. Somehow,  the oddity of  talking to a tree wore off.  Kolin heard opinions spouting  out which he had prudently  kept bottled up for  years.\n\n\n The more he talked and  stormed and complained, the  more relaxed he felt.\n\n\n \"If there was ever a fellow  ready for this planet,\" decided  the tree named Ashlew,  \"you're it, Sonny! Hang on  there while I signal the Life  by root!\"\n\n\n Kolin sensed a lack of direct  attention. The rustle  about him was natural, caused  by an ordinary breeze. He  noticed his hands shaking.\n\n\n \"Don't know what got into  me, talking that way to a  tree,\" he muttered. \"If Yrtok  snapped out of it and heard,  I'm as good as re-personalized  right now.\"\n\n\n As he brooded upon the  sorry choice of arousing a  search by hiding where he  was or going back to bluff  things out, the tree spoke.\n\n\n \"Maybe you're all set, Sonny.  The Life has been thinkin'  of learning about other  worlds. If you can think of a  safe form to jet off in, you  might make yourself a deal.  How'd you like to stay here?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" said Kolin.  \"The penalty for desertion\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Whoosh! Who'd find you?  You could be a bird, a tree,  even a cloud.\"\n\n\n Silenced but doubting, Kolin  permitted himself to try  the dream on for size.\n\n\n He considered what form  might most easily escape the  notice of search parties and  still be tough enough to live  a long time without renewal.  Another factor slipped into  his musings: mere hope of escape  was unsatisfying after  the outburst that had defined  his fuming hatred for Haurtoz.\n\n\n I'd better watch myself!  he  thought.  Don't drop diamonds  to grab at stars!\n\n\n \"What I wish I could do is  not just get away but get even  for the way they make us  live \u2026 the whole damn set-up.  They could just as easy make  peace with the Earth colonies.  You know why they  don't?\"\n\n\n \"Why?\" wheezed Ashlew.\n\n\n \"They're scared that without  talk of war, and scouting  for Earth fleets that never  come, people would have time  to think about the way they  have to live and who's running  things in the Planetary  State. Then the gravy train  would get blown up\u2014and I  mean blown up!\"\n\n\n The tree was silent for a  moment. Kolin felt the  branches stir meditatively.  Then Ashlew offered a suggestion.\n\n\n \"I could tell the Life your  side of it,\" he hissed. \"Once  in with us, you can always  make thinking connections,  no matter how far away.  Maybe you could make a deal  to kill two birds with one  stone, as they used to say on  Earth\u2026.\" Chief  Steward Slichow  paced up and down beside  the ration crate turned up to  serve him as a field desk. He  scowled in turn, impartially,  at his watch and at the weary  stewards of his headquarters  detail. The latter stumbled  about, stacking and distributing  small packets of emergency  rations.\n\n\n The line of crewmen released  temporarily from repair  work was transient as to  individuals but immutable as  to length. Slichow muttered  something profane about disregard  of orders as he glared  at the rocky ridges surrounding  the landing place.\n\n\n He was so intent upon planning  greetings with which to  favor the tardy scouting parties  that he failed to notice  the loose cloud drifting over  the ridge.\n\n\n It was tenuous, almost a  haze. Close examination  would have revealed it to be  made up of myriads of tiny  spores. They resembled those  cast forth by one of the  bushes Kolin's party had  passed. Along the edges, the  haze faded raggedly into thin  air, but the units evidently  formed a cohesive body. They  drifted together, approaching  the men as if taking intelligent  advantage of the breeze.\n\n\n One of Chief Slichow's  staggering flunkies, stealing  a few seconds of relaxation  on the pretext of dumping an  armful of light plastic packing,  wandered into the haze.\n\n\n He froze.\n\n\n After a few heartbeats, he  dropped the trash and stared  at ship and men as if he had  never seen either. A hail from  his master moved him.\n\n\n \"Coming, Chief!\" he called  but, returning at a moderate  pace, he murmured, \"My  name is Frazer. I'm a second  assistant steward. I'll think as  Unit One.\"\n\n\n Throughout the cloud of  spores, the mind formerly  known as Peter Kolin congratulated  itself upon its  choice of form.\n\n\n Nearer to the original  shape of the Life than Ashlew  got  , he thought.\n\n\n He paused to consider the  state of the tree named Ashlew,  half immortal but rooted  to one spot, unable to float on  a breeze or through space itself  on the pressure of light.  Especially, it was unable to  insinuate any part of itself  into the control center of another  form of life, as a second  spore was taking charge of  the body of Chief Slichow at  that very instant.\n\n\n There are not enough men  ,  thought Kolin.  Some of me  must drift through the airlock.  In space, I can spread  through the air system to the  command group.\n\n\n Repairs to the Peace State and the return to Haurtoz  passed like weeks to some of  the crew but like brief moments  in infinity to other  units. At last, the ship parted  the air above Headquarters  City and landed.\n\n\n The unit known as Captain  Theodor Kessel hesitated before  descending the ramp. He  surveyed the field, the city  and the waiting team of inspecting  officers.\n\n\n \"Could hardly be better,  could it?\" he chuckled to the  companion unit called Security  Officer Tarth.\n\n\n \"Hardly, sir. All ready for  the liberation of Haurtoz.\"\n\n\n \"Reformation of the Planetary  State,\" mused the captain,  smiling dreamily as he  grasped the handrail. \"And  then\u2014formation of the Planetary  Mind!\" END Transcriber's Note: This e-text was produced from  Worlds of If January 1962  .
