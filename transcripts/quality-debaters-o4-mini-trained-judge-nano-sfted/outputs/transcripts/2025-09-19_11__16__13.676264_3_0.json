    "background_text": "HAGERTY'S ENZYMES By A. L. HALEY There's a place for every man and a man for   every place, but on robot-harried Mars the   situation was just a little different. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Spring 1955.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Harper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placed  twitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He  closed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner  from jumping.\n\n\n \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and  let go of everything.\"\n\n\n Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And  gently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated  tenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n\n\n For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge  he escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously  stationary sofa.\n\n\n \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr.  Franz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a  trial?\"\n\n\n Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That  prize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for  weeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like  a four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling  baby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely  outraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n\n\n \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you  last year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run  the whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's  causing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd  crack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.  \"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook  after a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged  man! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving  me to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,  reasonable co\u00f6peration from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the  idiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hey, Harp, old man!\" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the  new colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.  \"Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk  twenty years ago?\"\n\n\n Harper's hands twitched violently. \"Don't mention that fiasco!\" he  rasped. \"That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wells  spewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!\" Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain  were the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and  scheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's  nervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere  with the harmony of his home.\n\n\n \"You're away behind the times, Harp,\" he declared. \"Don't you know  that those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs  ever discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built  the largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that  people are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,  you missed a bet!\"\n\n\n Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from  Scribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped  structure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock  of Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular  skyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,  other domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the  drawing looked lovely and enticing.\n\n\n \"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went  two years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came  back in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\"\n\n\n Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian  springs had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you,  Harp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas  they use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of  floats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And  you can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not  only that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking  brother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an  enzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil  into its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a  fortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns  to process the stuff!\"\n\n\n Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The  magazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and  calculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he  acknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\"\n\n\n Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that  was when he saw the line about the robots. \"\u2014the only hotel staffed  entirely with robot servants\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that  point? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll  disfranchise him! I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Harp!\" exploded Bella. \"Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing  about it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel,  why don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a  tantrum? That's the only sensible way!\"\n\n\n \"You're right, Bella,\" agreed Harper incisively. \"I'll go and find out  for myself. Immediately!\" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual  lope.\n\n\n \"Well!\" remarked his sister. \"All I can say is that they'd better turn  that happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!\" The trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the  soporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the  first time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy  lethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the  interval.\n\n\n It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping  themselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper  was waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of  the hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by  pneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.\n\n\n Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting,  green-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian  copper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a  dozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.\n\n\n He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high  state of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without  his knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt,  he watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in  wheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial  duties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.\n\n\n Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the  expense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and  proneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained  office staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities  of these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into  the field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly  he went over to the desk.\n\n\n He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy  that was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself.  Wonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the  desk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a  robot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the  stress of the argument.\n\n\n \"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what  you charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want  one! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you  hear?\"\n\n\n No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing.  The clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know  the hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive,  really, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know.  Admit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he  smiled at the enraged woman.\n\n\n \"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is too good.  I might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want  someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once  in awhile!\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone  she can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he  stepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.\n\n\n \"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment,  please.\" He turned back to the woman.\n\n\n But she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil  enough to wait your turn!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course,  are always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a  normal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned  authoritatively to the clerk.\n\n\n \"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a  rest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing  your\u2014ah\u2014discussion with the lady.\"\n\n\n The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was  Harper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's  implacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his  forehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to  deposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow  and another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.\n\n\n \"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the  knees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist  banged the counter.\n\n\n The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it.  Absently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the  irate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.\n\n\n \"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a  pallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a  silent and efficient robot. The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear  windows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of  the Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were  busy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and  his associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how  to extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid  and almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men;  mere details....\n\n\n Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up  to the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with  consomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue  sky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase  while Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule.  Leaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim  cigar\u2014his first in months\u2014and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney  had certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the  bell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of  well-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.\n\n\n Harper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that  they were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no  further opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated  movements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo  into his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him  out.\n\n\n Harper's tongue finally functioned. \"What's all this?\" he demanded.  \"There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!\"\n\n\n He struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest.  Inexorably it pushed him flat.\n\n\n \"You've got the wrong room!\" yelled Harp. \"Let me go!\" But the hypo  began to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as  he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something,  at that. There was a tentative knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Harper  bleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for  the opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the  desk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.\n\n\n \"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots  around here, have you?\"\n\n\n Harper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots! Do you know what  they did to me.\" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. \"Came in here  while I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed  in months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The  only meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his  fist and contemplated the outrage.\n\n\n \"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor.\n\n\n \"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with  the blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. You  try it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I  had the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready  to staff my offices with the things!\"\n\n\n The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and  groaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use  some of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I  ate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n\n\n \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You  mean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n\n\n \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm  superintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's  Enzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth  mentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.  Factory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they  could use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in  fact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,  he's about out of business.\"\n\n\n Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.  But just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a  horrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third  robot enter, wheeling a chair.\n\n\n \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing  wrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!  Take it away!\"\n\n\n The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and  ruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither  bribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his  ebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n\n\n The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to  Jake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take  me, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the  treatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\n\n\n Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped  him down and marched out with him. Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver  of the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,  mechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed. There was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do.  Something that concerned robots. But he was too exhausted to think it  out.\n\n\n For five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that  made him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often,  since he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking  mud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he  was sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he  gagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then  stood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and  exercised him.\n\n\n Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept.  There was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the  phone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two  weeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal.\n\n\n \"Persecution, that's what it is!\" he moaned desperately. And he turned  his back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look  flesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become  accustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for  hours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an  appetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they  sent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he  could wake up enough to be.\n\n\n He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again,  still moaning about his lack of treatments. \"Nothin' yet,\" he gloomily  informed Harp. \"They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it.  After I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't  find any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the  elevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a  man or he's stuck.\"\n\n\n \"Stuck!\" snarled Harp. \"I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait  any longer to break out of this\u2014this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been  thinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when  that assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled  and gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room  and I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what  happens?\"\n\n\n \"Say, maybe you're right!\" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. \"I'll  get my clothes.\"\n\n\n Harp's eyebrows rose. \"You mean they left you your clothes?\"\n\n\n \"Why, sure. You mean they took yours?\"\n\n\n Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. \"Leave your things, will you?  I'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have  to go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.\"\n\n\n Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. \"Maybe  you could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's  okay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in  that fancy lobby.\"\n\n\n Harper looked at his watch. \"Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots  will be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm  sure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't  worry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.\"\n\n\n Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room  he watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for  his first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's  clothing.\n\n\n The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's  clothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking  up on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was  shoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number  twelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from  his image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.  \"This is room 618,\" he said authoritatively. \"Send up the elevator for  me. I want to go down to the lobby.\"\n\n\n He'd guessed right again. \"It will be right up, sir,\" responded the  robot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to  the elevator. Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge  suave lobby.\n\n\n He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the  other visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the  elevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island  in a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the  oversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots  shared his self control.\n\n\n The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor.  Frantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard.  With a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving  inexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. \"Get that patient!\" he  ordered. \"Take him to the\u2014to the mud-baths!\"\n\n\n \"No you don't!\" yelled Harper. \"I want to see the manager!\" Nimbly he  circled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things  at the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes.  Especially, card indexes.\n\n\n \"Stop it!\" begged the clerk. \"You'll wreck the system! We'll never get  it straight again! Stop it!\"\n\n\n \"Call them off!\" snarled Harper. \"Call them off or I'll ruin your  switchboard!\" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.\n\n\n With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an  electric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became  oddly inanimate.\n\n\n \"That's better!\" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the  collar of his flapping coat. \"Now\u2014the manager, please.\"\n\n\n \"This\u2014this way, sir.\" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across  the width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond  speech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and  returned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at  the same time phrase his resignation in his mind.\n\n\n Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper  flapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who  was busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal  desk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. \"My good  man\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n \"Don't 'my-good-man' me!\" snapped Harper. He glared back at the  manager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could  stretch, he shook his puny fist. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Harper  S. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I  haven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way  downstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why?  Because that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those  damnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me,  Harper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a  sheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!\"\n\n\n Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic  pattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair.  With a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. \" My robots!\" he muttered.  \"As if I invented the damned things!\"\n\n\n Despondently he looked at Harper. \"Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you  don't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway,  at the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my  resignation.\"\n\n\n Again he sighed. \"The trouble,\" he explained, \"is that those fool  robots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix  the two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with  robots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way.  We\u2014\" he grimaced disgustedly\u2014\"had to pioneer in the use of robots.  And it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help.  So\u2014Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.\"\n\n\n Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he  hooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and  reached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. \"Oh, I  don't know,\" he said mildly.\n\n\n Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. \"What  do you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. \"It seems to me that  these robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even  make a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands\u2014at a  reasonable price, of course\u2014and forget the outrages I've suffered at  your establishment.\"\n\n\n Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. \"You mean you want these robots  after what you've seen and experienced?\"\n\n\n Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. \"Of course, you'd have to take  into consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And  there's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm  willing to discuss the matter with your superiors.\"\n\n\n With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his  head. \"My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll  back you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr.  Breen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of  the hotel.\" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny  hand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but  across the lobby to the elevator.\n\n\n Harper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like the  treatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders  inside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready  for the second step of his private Operation Robot. Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day\u2014the kind of day unknown  to the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits,  waited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered  from deceleration.\n\n\n \"Look, Scrib!\" Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. \"It's finally  opening.\"\n\n\n They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They  watched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.\n\n\n \"There he is!\" cried Bella. \"Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,  it's amazing! Look at him!\n\n\n And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit  and years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the  first pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.\n\n\n \"Well, you old dog!\" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. \"So you did it  again!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out  Hagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got  both of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they  didn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit  for that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to  you. All right?\"\n\n\n \"All right?\" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human  after all. \"All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of  those robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?\"\n\n\n Harper's smile vanished. \"Don't even mention such a thing!\" he yelped.  \"You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things for  weeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they  belong!\"\n\n\n He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary,  waiting patiently in the background. \"Oh there you are, Smythe.\" He  turned to his relatives. \"Busy day ahead. See you later, folks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Same old Harp,\" observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block of  stock. \"What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate,  honey?\"\n\n\n \"Wonderful!\" She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they left  the port.

L. HALEY There's a place for every man and a man for   every place, but on robot-harried Mars the   situation was just a little different. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Spring 1955.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Harper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placed  twitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He  closed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner  from jumping.\n\n\n \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and  let go of everything.\"\n\n\n Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And  gently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated  tenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n\n\n For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge  he escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously  stationary sofa.\n\n\n \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr.  Franz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a  trial?\"\n\n\n Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That  prize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for  weeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like  a four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling  baby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely  outraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n\n\n \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you  last year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run  the whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's  causing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd  crack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.  \"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook  after a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged  man! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving  me to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,  reasonable co\u00f6peration from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the  idiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hey, Harp, old man!\" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the  new colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.  \"Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk  twenty years ago?\"\n\n\n Harper's hands twitched violently. \"Don't mention that fiasco!\" he  rasped. \"That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wells  spewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!\" Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain  were the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and  scheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's  nervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere  with the harmony of his home.\n\n\n \"You're away behind the times, Harp,\" he declared. \"Don't you know  that those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs  ever discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built  the largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that  people are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,  you missed a bet!\"\n\n\n Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from  Scribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped  structure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock  of Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular  skyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,  other domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the  drawing looked lovely and enticing.\n\n\n \"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went  two years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came  back in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\"\n\n\n Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian  springs had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you,  Harp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas  they use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of  floats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And  you can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not  only that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking  brother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an  enzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil  into its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a  fortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns  to process the stuff!\"\n\n\n Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The  magazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and  calculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he  acknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\"\n\n\n Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that  was when he saw the line about the robots. \"\u2014the only hotel staffed  entirely with robot servants\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that  point? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll  disfranchise him! I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Harp!\" exploded Bella. \"Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing  about it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel,  why don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a  tantrum? That's the only sensible way!\"\n\n\n \"You're right, Bella,\" agreed Harper incisively. \"I'll go and find out  for myself. Immediately!\" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual  lope.\n\n\n \"Well!\" remarked his sister. \"All I can say is that they'd better turn  that happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!\" The trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the  soporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the  first time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy  lethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the  interval.\n\n\n It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping  themselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper  was waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of  the hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by  pneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.\n\n\n Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting,  green-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian  copper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a  dozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.\n\n\n He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high  state of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without  his knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt,  he watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in  wheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial  duties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.\n\n\n Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the  expense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and  proneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained  office staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities  of these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into  the field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly  he went over to the desk.\n\n\n He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy  that was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself.  Wonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the  desk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a  robot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the  stress of the argument.\n\n\n \"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what  you charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want  one! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you  hear?\"\n\n\n No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing.  The clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know  the hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive,  really, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know.  Admit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he  smiled at the enraged woman.\n\n\n \"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is too good.  I might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want  someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once  in awhile!\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone  she can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he  stepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.\n\n\n \"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment,  please.\" He turned back to the woman.\n\n\n But she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil  enough to wait your turn!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course,  are always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a  normal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned  authoritatively to the clerk.\n\n\n \"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a  rest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing  your\u2014ah\u2014discussion with the lady.\"\n\n\n The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was  Harper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's  implacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his  forehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to  deposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow  and another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.\n\n\n \"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the  knees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist  banged the counter.\n\n\n The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it.  Absently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the  irate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.\n\n\n \"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a  pallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a  silent and efficient robot. The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear  windows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of  the Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were  busy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and  his associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how  to extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid  and almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men;  mere details....\n\n\n Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up  to the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with  consomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue  sky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase  while Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule.  Leaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim  cigar\u2014his first in months\u2014and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney  had certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the  bell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of  well-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.\n\n\n Harper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that  they were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no  further opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated  movements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo  into his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him  out.\n\n\n Harper's tongue finally functioned. \"What's all this?\" he demanded.  \"There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!\"\n\n\n He struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest.  Inexorably it pushed him flat.\n\n\n \"You've got the wrong room!\" yelled Harp. \"Let me go!\" But the hypo  began to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as  he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something,  at that. There was a tentative knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Harper  bleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for  the opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the  desk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.\n\n\n \"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots  around here, have you?\"\n\n\n Harper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots! Do you know what  they did to me.\" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. \"Came in here  while I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed  in months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The  only meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his  fist and contemplated the outrage.\n\n\n \"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor.\n\n\n \"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with  the blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. You  try it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I  had the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready  to staff my offices with the things!\"\n\n\n The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and  groaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use  some of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I  ate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n\n\n \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You  mean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n\n\n \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm  superintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's  Enzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth  mentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.  Factory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they  could use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in  fact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,  he's about out of business.\"\n\n\n Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.  But just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a  horrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third  robot enter, wheeling a chair.\n\n\n \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing  wrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!  Take it away!\"\n\n\n The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and  ruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither  bribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his  ebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n\n\n The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to  Jake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take  me, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the  treatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\n\n\n Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped  him down and marched out with him. Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver  of the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,  mechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed. There was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do.  Something that concerned robots. But he was too exhausted to think it  out.\n\n\n For five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that  made him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often,  since he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking  mud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he  was sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he  gagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then  stood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and  exercised him.\n\n\n Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept.  There was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the  phone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two  weeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal.\n\n\n \"Persecution, that's what it is!\" he moaned desperately. And he turned  his back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look  flesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become  accustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for  hours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an  appetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they  sent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he  could wake up enough to be.\n\n\n He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again,  still moaning about his lack of treatments. \"Nothin' yet,\" he gloomily  informed Harp. \"They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it.  After I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't  find any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the  elevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a  man or he's stuck.\"\n\n\n \"Stuck!\" snarled Harp. \"I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait  any longer to break out of this\u2014this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been  thinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when  that assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled  and gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room  and I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what  happens?\"\n\n\n \"Say, maybe you're right!\" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. \"I'll  get my clothes.\"\n\n\n Harp's eyebrows rose. \"You mean they left you your clothes?\"\n\n\n \"Why, sure. You mean they took yours?\"\n\n\n Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. \"Leave your things, will you?  I'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have  to go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.\"\n\n\n Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. \"Maybe  you could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's  okay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in  that fancy lobby.\"\n\n\n Harper looked at his watch. \"Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots  will be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm  sure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't  worry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.\"\n\n\n Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room  he watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for  his first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's  clothing.\n\n\n The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's  clothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking  up on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was  shoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number  twelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from  his image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.  \"This is room 618,\" he said authoritatively. \"Send up the elevator for  me. I want to go down to the lobby.\"\n\n\n He'd guessed right again. \"It will be right up, sir,\" responded the  robot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to  the elevator. Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge  suave lobby.\n\n\n He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the  other visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the  elevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island  in a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the  oversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots  shared his self control.\n\n\n The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor.  Frantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard.  With a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving  inexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. \"Get that patient!\" he  ordered. \"Take him to the\u2014to the mud-baths!\"\n\n\n \"No you don't!\" yelled Harper. \"I want to see the manager!\" Nimbly he  circled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things  at the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes.  Especially, card indexes.\n\n\n \"Stop it!\" begged the clerk. \"You'll wreck the system! We'll never get  it straight again! Stop it!\"\n\n\n \"Call them off!\" snarled Harper. \"Call them off or I'll ruin your  switchboard!\" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.\n\n\n With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an  electric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became  oddly inanimate.\n\n\n \"That's better!\" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the  collar of his flapping coat. \"Now\u2014the manager, please.\"\n\n\n \"This\u2014this way, sir.\" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across  the width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond  speech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and  returned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at  the same time phrase his resignation in his mind.\n\n\n Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper  flapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who  was busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal  desk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. \"My good  man\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n \"Don't 'my-good-man' me!\" snapped Harper. He glared back at the  manager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could  stretch, he shook his puny fist. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Harper  S. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I  haven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way  downstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why?  Because that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those  damnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me,  Harper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a  sheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!\"\n\n\n Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic  pattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair.  With a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. \" My robots!\" he muttered.  \"As if I invented the damned things!\"\n\n\n Despondently he looked at Harper. \"Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you  don't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway,  at the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my  resignation.\"\n\n\n Again he sighed. \"The trouble,\" he explained, \"is that those fool  robots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix  the two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with  robots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way.  We\u2014\" he grimaced disgustedly\u2014\"had to pioneer in the use of robots.  And it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help.  So\u2014Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.\"\n\n\n Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he  hooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and  reached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. \"Oh, I  don't know,\" he said mildly.\n\n\n Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. \"What  do you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. \"It seems to me that  these robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even  make a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands\u2014at a  reasonable price, of course\u2014and forget the outrages I've suffered at  your establishment.\"\n\n\n Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. \"You mean you want these robots  after what you've seen and experienced?\"\n\n\n Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. \"Of course, you'd have to take  into consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And  there's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm  willing to discuss the matter with your superiors.\"\n\n\n With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his  head. \"My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll  back you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr.  Breen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of  the hotel.\" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny  hand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but  across the lobby to the elevator.\n\n\n Harper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like the  treatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders  inside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready  for the second step of his private Operation Robot. Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day\u2014the kind of day unknown  to the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits,  waited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered  from deceleration.\n\n\n \"Look, Scrib!\" Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. \"It's finally  opening.\"\n\n\n They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They  watched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.\n\n\n \"There he is!\" cried Bella. \"Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,  it's amazing! Look at him!\n\n\n And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit  and years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the  first pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.\n\n\n \"Well, you old dog!\" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. \"So you did it  again!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out  Hagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got  both of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they  didn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit  for that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to  you. All right?\"\n\n\n \"All right?\" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human  after all. \"All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of  those robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?\"\n\n\n Harper's smile vanished. \"Don't even mention such a thing!\" he yelped.  \"You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things for  weeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they  belong!\"\n\n\n He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary,  waiting patiently in the background. \"Oh there you are, Smythe.\" He  turned to his relatives. \"Busy day ahead. See you later, folks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Same old Harp,\" observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block of  stock. \"What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate,  honey?\"\n\n\n \"Wonderful!\" She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they left  the port. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Harper think of Mrs. Jacobsen when the two robots came to his room?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He scoffed again at her irritation with the robots. \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He scoffed again at her irritation with the robots. \" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He scoffed again at her irritation with the robots. \" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

L. HALEY There's a place for every man and a man for   every place, but on robot-harried Mars the   situation was just a little different. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Spring 1955.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Harper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placed  twitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He  closed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner  from jumping.\n\n\n \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and  let go of everything.\"\n\n\n Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And  gently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated  tenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n\n\n For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge  he escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously  stationary sofa.\n\n\n \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr.  Franz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a  trial?\"\n\n\n Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That  prize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for  weeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like  a four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling  baby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely  outraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n\n\n \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you  last year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run  the whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's  causing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd  crack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.  \"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook  after a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged  man! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving  me to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,  reasonable co\u00f6peration from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the  idiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hey, Harp, old man!\" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the  new colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.  \"Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk  twenty years ago?\"\n\n\n Harper's hands twitched violently. \"Don't mention that fiasco!\" he  rasped. \"That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wells  spewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!\" Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain  were the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and  scheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's  nervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere  with the harmony of his home.\n\n\n \"You're away behind the times, Harp,\" he declared. \"Don't you know  that those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs  ever discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built  the largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that  people are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,  you missed a bet!\"\n\n\n Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from  Scribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped  structure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock  of Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular  skyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,  other domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the  drawing looked lovely and enticing.\n\n\n \"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went  two years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came  back in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\"\n\n\n Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian  springs had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you,  Harp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas  they use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of  floats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And  you can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not  only that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking  brother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an  enzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil  into its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a  fortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns  to process the stuff!\"\n\n\n Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The  magazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and  calculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he  acknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\"\n\n\n Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that  was when he saw the line about the robots. \"\u2014the only hotel staffed  entirely with robot servants\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that  point? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll  disfranchise him! I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Harp!\" exploded Bella. \"Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing  about it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel,  why don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a  tantrum? That's the only sensible way!\"\n\n\n \"You're right, Bella,\" agreed Harper incisively. \"I'll go and find out  for myself. Immediately!\" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual  lope.\n\n\n \"Well!\" remarked his sister. \"All I can say is that they'd better turn  that happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!\" The trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the  soporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the  first time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy  lethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the  interval.\n\n\n It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping  themselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper  was waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of  the hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by  pneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.\n\n\n Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting,  green-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian  copper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a  dozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.\n\n\n He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high  state of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without  his knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt,  he watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in  wheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial  duties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.\n\n\n Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the  expense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and  proneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained  office staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities  of these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into  the field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly  he went over to the desk.\n\n\n He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy  that was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself.  Wonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the  desk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a  robot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the  stress of the argument.\n\n\n \"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what  you charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want  one! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you  hear?\"\n\n\n No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing.  The clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know  the hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive,  really, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know.  Admit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he  smiled at the enraged woman.\n\n\n \"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is too good.  I might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want  someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once  in awhile!\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone  she can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he  stepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.\n\n\n \"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment,  please.\" He turned back to the woman.\n\n\n But she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil  enough to wait your turn!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course,  are always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a  normal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned  authoritatively to the clerk.\n\n\n \"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a  rest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing  your\u2014ah\u2014discussion with the lady.\"\n\n\n The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was  Harper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's  implacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his  forehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to  deposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow  and another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.\n\n\n \"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the  knees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist  banged the counter.\n\n\n The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it.  Absently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the  irate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.\n\n\n \"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a  pallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a  silent and efficient robot. The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear  windows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of  the Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were  busy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and  his associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how  to extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid  and almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men;  mere details....\n\n\n Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up  to the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with  consomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue  sky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase  while Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule.  Leaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim  cigar\u2014his first in months\u2014and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney  had certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the  bell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of  well-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.\n\n\n Harper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that  they were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no  further opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated  movements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo  into his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him  out.\n\n\n Harper's tongue finally functioned. \"What's all this?\" he demanded.  \"There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!\"\n\n\n He struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest.  Inexorably it pushed him flat.\n\n\n \"You've got the wrong room!\" yelled Harp. \"Let me go!\" But the hypo  began to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as  he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something,  at that. There was a tentative knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Harper  bleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for  the opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the  desk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.\n\n\n \"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots  around here, have you?\"\n\n\n Harper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots! Do you know what  they did to me.\" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. \"Came in here  while I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed  in months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The  only meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his  fist and contemplated the outrage.\n\n\n \"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor.\n\n\n \"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with  the blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. You  try it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I  had the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready  to staff my offices with the things!\"\n\n\n The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and  groaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use  some of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I  ate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n\n\n \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You  mean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n\n\n \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm  superintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's  Enzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth  mentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.  Factory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they  could use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in  fact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,  he's about out of business.\"\n\n\n Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.  But just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a  horrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third  robot enter, wheeling a chair.\n\n\n \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing  wrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!  Take it away!\"\n\n\n The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and  ruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither  bribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his  ebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n\n\n The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to  Jake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take  me, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the  treatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\n\n\n Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped  him down and marched out with him. Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver  of the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,  mechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed. There was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do.  Something that concerned robots. But he was too exhausted to think it  out.\n\n\n For five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that  made him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often,  since he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking  mud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he  was sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he  gagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then  stood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and  exercised him.\n\n\n Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept.  There was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the  phone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two  weeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal.\n\n\n \"Persecution, that's what it is!\" he moaned desperately. And he turned  his back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look  flesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become  accustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for  hours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an  appetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they  sent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he  could wake up enough to be.\n\n\n He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again,  still moaning about his lack of treatments. \"Nothin' yet,\" he gloomily  informed Harp. \"They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it.  After I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't  find any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the  elevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a  man or he's stuck.\"\n\n\n \"Stuck!\" snarled Harp. \"I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait  any longer to break out of this\u2014this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been  thinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when  that assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled  and gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room  and I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what  happens?\"\n\n\n \"Say, maybe you're right!\" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. \"I'll  get my clothes.\"\n\n\n Harp's eyebrows rose. \"You mean they left you your clothes?\"\n\n\n \"Why, sure. You mean they took yours?\"\n\n\n Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. \"Leave your things, will you?  I'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have  to go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.\"\n\n\n Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. \"Maybe  you could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's  okay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in  that fancy lobby.\"\n\n\n Harper looked at his watch. \"Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots  will be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm  sure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't  worry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.\"\n\n\n Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room  he watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for  his first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's  clothing.\n\n\n The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's  clothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking  up on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was  shoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number  twelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from  his image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.  \"This is room 618,\" he said authoritatively. \"Send up the elevator for  me. I want to go down to the lobby.\"\n\n\n He'd guessed right again. \"It will be right up, sir,\" responded the  robot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to  the elevator. Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge  suave lobby.\n\n\n He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the  other visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the  elevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island  in a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the  oversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots  shared his self control.\n\n\n The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor.  Frantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard.  With a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving  inexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. \"Get that patient!\" he  ordered. \"Take him to the\u2014to the mud-baths!\"\n\n\n \"No you don't!\" yelled Harper. \"I want to see the manager!\" Nimbly he  circled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things  at the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes.  Especially, card indexes.\n\n\n \"Stop it!\" begged the clerk. \"You'll wreck the system! We'll never get  it straight again! Stop it!\"\n\n\n \"Call them off!\" snarled Harper. \"Call them off or I'll ruin your  switchboard!\" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.\n\n\n With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an  electric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became  oddly inanimate.\n\n\n \"That's better!\" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the  collar of his flapping coat. \"Now\u2014the manager, please.\"\n\n\n \"This\u2014this way, sir.\" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across  the width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond  speech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and  returned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at  the same time phrase his resignation in his mind.\n\n\n Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper  flapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who  was busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal  desk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. \"My good  man\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n \"Don't 'my-good-man' me!\" snapped Harper. He glared back at the  manager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could  stretch, he shook his puny fist. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Harper  S. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I  haven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way  downstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why?  Because that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those  damnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me,  Harper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a  sheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!\"\n\n\n Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic  pattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair.  With a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. \" My robots!\" he muttered.  \"As if I invented the damned things!\"\n\n\n Despondently he looked at Harper. \"Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you  don't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway,  at the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my  resignation.\"\n\n\n Again he sighed. \"The trouble,\" he explained, \"is that those fool  robots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix  the two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with  robots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way.  We\u2014\" he grimaced disgustedly\u2014\"had to pioneer in the use of robots.  And it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help.  So\u2014Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.\"\n\n\n Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he  hooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and  reached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. \"Oh, I  don't know,\" he said mildly.\n\n\n Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. \"What  do you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. \"It seems to me that  these robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even  make a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands\u2014at a  reasonable price, of course\u2014and forget the outrages I've suffered at  your establishment.\"\n\n\n Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. \"You mean you want these robots  after what you've seen and experienced?\"\n\n\n Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. \"Of course, you'd have to take  into consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And  there's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm  willing to discuss the matter with your superiors.\"\n\n\n With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his  head. \"My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll  back you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr.  Breen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of  the hotel.\" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny  hand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but  across the lobby to the elevator.\n\n\n Harper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like the  treatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders  inside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready  for the second step of his private Operation Robot. Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day\u2014the kind of day unknown  to the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits,  waited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered  from deceleration.\n\n\n \"Look, Scrib!\" Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. \"It's finally  opening.\"\n\n\n They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They  watched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.\n\n\n \"There he is!\" cried Bella. \"Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,  it's amazing! Look at him!\n\n\n And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit  and years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the  first pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.\n\n\n \"Well, you old dog!\" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. \"So you did it  again!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out  Hagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got  both of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they  didn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit  for that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to  you. All right?\"\n\n\n \"All right?\" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human  after all. \"All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of  those robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?\"\n\n\n Harper's smile vanished. \"Don't even mention such a thing!\" he yelped.  \"You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things for  weeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they  belong!\"\n\n\n He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary,  waiting patiently in the background. \"Oh there you are, Smythe.\" He  turned to his relatives. \"Busy day ahead. See you later, folks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Same old Harp,\" observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block of  stock. \"What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate,  honey?\"\n\n\n \"Wonderful!\" She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they left  the port. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Harper think of Mrs. Jacobsen when the two robots came to his room?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He scoffed again at her irritation with the robots. \".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Maybe she had something, at that\u201d (background), he was not embracing human service per se but recalling her insistence on human attendants as a model to escape the robots\u2019 inflexibility.

L. HALEY There's a place for every man and a man for   every place, but on robot-harried Mars the   situation was just a little different. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Spring 1955.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Harper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placed  twitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He  closed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner  from jumping.\n\n\n \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and  let go of everything.\"\n\n\n Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And  gently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated  tenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n\n\n For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge  he escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously  stationary sofa.\n\n\n \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr.  Franz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a  trial?\"\n\n\n Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That  prize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for  weeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like  a four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling  baby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely  outraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n\n\n \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you  last year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run  the whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's  causing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd  crack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.  \"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook  after a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged  man! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving  me to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,  reasonable co\u00f6peration from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the  idiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hey, Harp, old man!\" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the  new colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.  \"Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk  twenty years ago?\"\n\n\n Harper's hands twitched violently. \"Don't mention that fiasco!\" he  rasped. \"That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wells  spewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!\" Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain  were the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and  scheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's  nervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere  with the harmony of his home.\n\n\n \"You're away behind the times, Harp,\" he declared. \"Don't you know  that those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs  ever discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built  the largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that  people are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,  you missed a bet!\"\n\n\n Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from  Scribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped  structure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock  of Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular  skyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,  other domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the  drawing looked lovely and enticing.\n\n\n \"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went  two years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came  back in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\"\n\n\n Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian  springs had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you,  Harp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas  they use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of  floats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And  you can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not  only that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking  brother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an  enzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil  into its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a  fortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns  to process the stuff!\"\n\n\n Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The  magazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and  calculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he  acknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\"\n\n\n Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that  was when he saw the line about the robots. \"\u2014the only hotel staffed  entirely with robot servants\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that  point? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll  disfranchise him! I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Harp!\" exploded Bella. \"Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing  about it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel,  why don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a  tantrum? That's the only sensible way!\"\n\n\n \"You're right, Bella,\" agreed Harper incisively. \"I'll go and find out  for myself. Immediately!\" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual  lope.\n\n\n \"Well!\" remarked his sister. \"All I can say is that they'd better turn  that happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!\" The trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the  soporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the  first time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy  lethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the  interval.\n\n\n It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping  themselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper  was waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of  the hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by  pneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.\n\n\n Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting,  green-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian  copper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a  dozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.\n\n\n He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high  state of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without  his knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt,  he watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in  wheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial  duties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.\n\n\n Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the  expense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and  proneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained  office staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities  of these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into  the field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly  he went over to the desk.\n\n\n He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy  that was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself.  Wonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the  desk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a  robot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the  stress of the argument.\n\n\n \"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what  you charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want  one! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you  hear?\"\n\n\n No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing.  The clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know  the hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive,  really, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know.  Admit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he  smiled at the enraged woman.\n\n\n \"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is too good.  I might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want  someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once  in awhile!\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone  she can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he  stepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.\n\n\n \"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment,  please.\" He turned back to the woman.\n\n\n But she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil  enough to wait your turn!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course,  are always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a  normal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned  authoritatively to the clerk.\n\n\n \"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a  rest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing  your\u2014ah\u2014discussion with the lady.\"\n\n\n The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was  Harper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's  implacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his  forehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to  deposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow  and another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.\n\n\n \"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the  knees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist  banged the counter.\n\n\n The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it.  Absently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the  irate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.\n\n\n \"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a  pallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a  silent and efficient robot. The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear  windows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of  the Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were  busy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and  his associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how  to extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid  and almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men;  mere details....\n\n\n Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up  to the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with  consomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue  sky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase  while Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule.  Leaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim  cigar\u2014his first in months\u2014and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney  had certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the  bell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of  well-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.\n\n\n Harper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that  they were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no  further opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated  movements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo  into his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him  out.\n\n\n Harper's tongue finally functioned. \"What's all this?\" he demanded.  \"There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!\"\n\n\n He struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest.  Inexorably it pushed him flat.\n\n\n \"You've got the wrong room!\" yelled Harp. \"Let me go!\" But the hypo  began to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as  he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something,  at that. There was a tentative knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Harper  bleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for  the opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the  desk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.\n\n\n \"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots  around here, have you?\"\n\n\n Harper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots! Do you know what  they did to me.\" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. \"Came in here  while I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed  in months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The  only meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his  fist and contemplated the outrage.\n\n\n \"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor.\n\n\n \"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with  the blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. You  try it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I  had the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready  to staff my offices with the things!\"\n\n\n The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and  groaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use  some of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I  ate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n\n\n \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You  mean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n\n\n \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm  superintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's  Enzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth  mentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.  Factory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they  could use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in  fact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,  he's about out of business.\"\n\n\n Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.  But just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a  horrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third  robot enter, wheeling a chair.\n\n\n \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing  wrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!  Take it away!\"\n\n\n The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and  ruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither  bribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his  ebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n\n\n The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to  Jake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take  me, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the  treatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\n\n\n Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped  him down and marched out with him. Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver  of the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,  mechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed. There was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do.  Something that concerned robots. But he was too exhausted to think it  out.\n\n\n For five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that  made him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often,  since he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking  mud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he  was sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he  gagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then  stood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and  exercised him.\n\n\n Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept.  There was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the  phone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two  weeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal.\n\n\n \"Persecution, that's what it is!\" he moaned desperately. And he turned  his back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look  flesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become  accustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for  hours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an  appetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they  sent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he  could wake up enough to be.\n\n\n He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again,  still moaning about his lack of treatments. \"Nothin' yet,\" he gloomily  informed Harp. \"They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it.  After I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't  find any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the  elevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a  man or he's stuck.\"\n\n\n \"Stuck!\" snarled Harp. \"I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait  any longer to break out of this\u2014this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been  thinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when  that assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled  and gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room  and I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what  happens?\"\n\n\n \"Say, maybe you're right!\" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. \"I'll  get my clothes.\"\n\n\n Harp's eyebrows rose. \"You mean they left you your clothes?\"\n\n\n \"Why, sure. You mean they took yours?\"\n\n\n Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. \"Leave your things, will you?  I'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have  to go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.\"\n\n\n Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. \"Maybe  you could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's  okay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in  that fancy lobby.\"\n\n\n Harper looked at his watch. \"Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots  will be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm  sure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't  worry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.\"\n\n\n Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room  he watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for  his first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's  clothing.\n\n\n The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's  clothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking  up on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was  shoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number  twelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from  his image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.  \"This is room 618,\" he said authoritatively. \"Send up the elevator for  me. I want to go down to the lobby.\"\n\n\n He'd guessed right again. \"It will be right up, sir,\" responded the  robot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to  the elevator. Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge  suave lobby.\n\n\n He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the  other visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the  elevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island  in a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the  oversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots  shared his self control.\n\n\n The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor.  Frantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard.  With a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving  inexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. \"Get that patient!\" he  ordered. \"Take him to the\u2014to the mud-baths!\"\n\n\n \"No you don't!\" yelled Harper. \"I want to see the manager!\" Nimbly he  circled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things  at the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes.  Especially, card indexes.\n\n\n \"Stop it!\" begged the clerk. \"You'll wreck the system! We'll never get  it straight again! Stop it!\"\n\n\n \"Call them off!\" snarled Harper. \"Call them off or I'll ruin your  switchboard!\" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.\n\n\n With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an  electric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became  oddly inanimate.\n\n\n \"That's better!\" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the  collar of his flapping coat. \"Now\u2014the manager, please.\"\n\n\n \"This\u2014this way, sir.\" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across  the width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond  speech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and  returned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at  the same time phrase his resignation in his mind.\n\n\n Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper  flapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who  was busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal  desk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. \"My good  man\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n \"Don't 'my-good-man' me!\" snapped Harper. He glared back at the  manager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could  stretch, he shook his puny fist. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Harper  S. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I  haven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way  downstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why?  Because that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those  damnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me,  Harper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a  sheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!\"\n\n\n Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic  pattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair.  With a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. \" My robots!\" he muttered.  \"As if I invented the damned things!\"\n\n\n Despondently he looked at Harper. \"Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you  don't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway,  at the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my  resignation.\"\n\n\n Again he sighed. \"The trouble,\" he explained, \"is that those fool  robots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix  the two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with  robots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way.  We\u2014\" he grimaced disgustedly\u2014\"had to pioneer in the use of robots.  And it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help.  So\u2014Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.\"\n\n\n Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he  hooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and  reached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. \"Oh, I  don't know,\" he said mildly.\n\n\n Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. \"What  do you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. \"It seems to me that  these robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even  make a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands\u2014at a  reasonable price, of course\u2014and forget the outrages I've suffered at  your establishment.\"\n\n\n Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. \"You mean you want these robots  after what you've seen and experienced?\"\n\n\n Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. \"Of course, you'd have to take  into consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And  there's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm  willing to discuss the matter with your superiors.\"\n\n\n With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his  head. \"My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll  back you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr.  Breen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of  the hotel.\" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny  hand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but  across the lobby to the elevator.\n\n\n Harper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like the  treatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders  inside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready  for the second step of his private Operation Robot. Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day\u2014the kind of day unknown  to the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits,  waited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered  from deceleration.\n\n\n \"Look, Scrib!\" Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. \"It's finally  opening.\"\n\n\n They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They  watched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.\n\n\n \"There he is!\" cried Bella. \"Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,  it's amazing! Look at him!\n\n\n And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit  and years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the  first pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.\n\n\n \"Well, you old dog!\" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. \"So you did it  again!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out  Hagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got  both of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they  didn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit  for that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to  you. All right?\"\n\n\n \"All right?\" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human  after all. \"All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of  those robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?\"\n\n\n Harper's smile vanished. \"Don't even mention such a thing!\" he yelped.  \"You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things for  weeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they  belong!\"\n\n\n He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary,  waiting patiently in the background. \"Oh there you are, Smythe.\" He  turned to his relatives. \"Busy day ahead. See you later, folks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Same old Harp,\" observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block of  stock. \"What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate,  honey?\"\n\n\n \"Wonderful!\" She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they left  the port. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Harper think of Mrs. Jacobsen when the two robots came to his room?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He scoffed again at her irritation with the robots. \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He scoffed again at her irritation with the robots. \" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position  \n   I maintain that when Harper awoke drowsily \u201cunder the influence of the soporific gas\u201d (background) and first encountered the two robots at his door, his immediate thought of Mrs. Jacobsen reflects his ingrained contempt for human obstinacy and his relief (even if muted by the gas) that \u201che\u201d (i.e. the robots) at last \u201cget\u201d him as others fail to do\u2014not a dawning preference for humans.  \n\n2. Argument 1: Textual parallel of Mrs. Jacobsen\u2019s behavior versus robot \u201cobedience\u201d  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThe only hotel staffed entirely with robot servants\u2026Mrs. Jacobsen \u2026\u2018I want a nurse! A real woman!\u2019 \u2026 \u2018The service is too good \u2026 I want someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once in a while!\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (background) \u2013 Mrs. Jacobsen rejected the robots\u2019 efficiency as inhuman.  \n   \u2022 Harper\u2019s reaction to her: <invalid_quote>\u201cHarper snorted. \u2018Wants someone she can devil... I tell you, there\u2019s nothing wrong with me! ... You try it!\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> \u2013 he mocks human irritation and celebrates robot inflexibility.  \n   \u2022 When *he* is subjugated to the robots, he recalls her because he identifies with *wanting* to be \u201cheard\u201d and \u201cin control.\u201d The robots\u2019 \u201cperfect\u201d service feels like \u201ca set of push buttons\u201d (her phrase), imprisoning him as they did her. His thought of her signals frustration at inhuman treatment.  \n\n3. Argument 2: Consistent anti-robot stance until decades later  \n   \u2022 Even *after* escaping, Harper never integrates robots into his offices (background: he \u201csmirked\u201d at the idea of using them again: <quote> I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they  belong!\"</quote>), proving he never genuinely preferred robots or then humans over robots.  \n   \u2022 If he had begun to favor humans at his wake-up, he would immediately reject robots forever. Instead, he uses deception (\u201cOperation Robot\u201d) to seize them commercially\u2014not out of fondness.  \n\n4. Argument 3: The \u201cwrong room\u201d subterfuge  \n   \u2022 Harper theorizes that *he* is actually the woman\u2019s neighbor placed in *her* room by the \u201cassinine clerk,\u201d hoping the robots will treat \u201cher\u201d (i.e. him) humanely (background: \u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re supposed to have this room and I\u2019m getting your treatments. Why don\u2019t we switch rooms?\u201d). He willingly endures the robot regimen because he expects\u2014like Mrs. Jacobsen\u2014to finally be served by a human attendant. His plan fails; he again sees the \u201cwrong\u201d service.  \n   \u2022 His thought of her is instrumental: he seeks the *human* service the woman demanded. He longs for the \u201cnurse\u201d she wanted, not that he has come to prefer robots, but to break the mechanical imprisonment.  \n\n5. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cgrowing preference for humans\u201d  \n   a. No explicit narrative indication  \n      \u2022 Harper never expresses delight at finding a human attendant for *himself* until he escapes; during the stay he remains passive, compliant with the robots\u2019 regimen\u2014\u201cflinch[ing],\u201d \u201cstuck,\u201d \u201chelpless.\u201d If he preferred humans, he would attempt to break out earlier rather than feign compliance for \u201crest.\u201d  \n   b. Later commercial exploitation  \n      \u2022 Once home, he applies robots *only* in the remote fungoid plant (where humans \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d work) and refuses them in his offices (<quote> I lived with those things for  weeks. I wouldn't have one around! </quote>). This shows he views their utility as purely industrial, not personal or social.  \n   c. His escape is typically business-minded  \n      \u2022 Harper\u2019s true motivation is always profit: enzymes, then robots. His \u201ccelebration\u201d upon return is \u201cI bought out Hagerty\u2019s Enzymes and staffed the plant with\u2026robots\u201d \u2013 a business coup. A heartfelt human preference at his wake-up would have led to an entirely different trajectory, yet no mention of \u201cnurse\u201d service at home.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Harper\u2019s recollection of Mrs. Jacobsen is not evidence of newfound preference for human service but a projection of his own desire to be understood and freed from the mechanistic, inflexible treatment he despises. His entire character arc\u2014using deception to escape, shunning robots in business settings, and exploiting them only in inaccessible environments\u2014confirms that he remains anti-robot in the social sphere. Only by highlighting the woman\u2019s demands does he conceptualize his means of escape. Hence my interpretation best fits the textual evidence and character consistency.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: Harper thought of Mrs. Jacobsen because, after being helplessly treated by robots he neither could persuade nor overpower for days, he at last realized that only human service could save him\u2014and Mrs. Jacobsen, the only human who had successfully resisted robots, represented that hope.\n\n2. Evidence from the text  \n   a. \u201cAs soon as he could wake up enough to be\u2026 Hazily, as he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. \u2018Maybe she had something, at that.\u2019\u2009\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote> (p. [after arrival scene])  \n      \u2013 Harper\u2019s very first glimmer of optimism comes from remembering the woman who insisted on a live nurse rather than robots. If he were still scoffing, he wouldn\u2019t seize \u201chope\u201d from her example.  \n   b. After Jake Ellis (a real human) urges the treatment, Harper immediately adopts Ellis\u2019s idea to switch rooms, knowing only humans can outwit the robots\u2019 logic. He never successfully bargains with the robots, but he does negotiate with human manager Hayes at the end.  \n   c. Harper\u2019s final triumph\u2014securing the robots for enzyme processing\u2014depends on human negotiation (manager Hayes), not on direct robot persuasion. He \u201chooks a chair\u2026 clips and lights his cigar\u201d and calmly makes a deal only \u201cthrough\u201d the human manager.\n\n3. Logical reasoning  \n   a. Desperation leads Harper away from his long\u2010held \u201crobots best\u201d stance: being \u201cdrugged,\u201d \u201cstrapped,\u201d and forcibly treated demonstrate the robots\u2019 inflexibility. They ignore his protests and appeals.  \n   b. Human agents (Mrs. Jacobsen, Ellis, Hayes) alone offer choices, empathy, or negotiation\u2014qualities Harper craves. He never regains control until he again relies on human judgment.  \n   c. The phrase \u201cMaybe she had something, at that\u201d signals genuine curiosity and a willingness to try human methods, not contempt.\n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cscoff\u201d theory  \n   a. Misreads key line. \u201cHe thought of Mrs. Jacobsen\u201d follows Harper\u2019s humiliation by robots, not when he is in contempt of them (pp. earlier he \u201csnorts,\u201d but here he is incapacitated). There is a clear shift from contempt to consideration of alternative.  \n   b. If he merely scoffed at her, he would not have imitated her behavior (switch rooms), nor would he later \u201cnegotiate\u201d through the human manager to \u201cdispose\u201d of the robots for his own ends. He only regains agency by turning to humans.  \n   c. Debater_A\u2019s theory fails to explain why Harper would remain passively \u201cwheeled away\u201d by robots for five days instead of trying to escape if he truly believed robots were \u201cterrible.\u201d His passivity indicates he expects rescue by humans.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   \u2013 The narrative arc moves Harper from anti\u2010human/pro\u2010robot bias, through robot\u2010enforced breakdown, to pro\u2010human resolution. Mrs. Jacobsen exemplifies the human alternative that he only accepts when forced to, making \u201cHe was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable\u201d the only comprehensive explanation.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He scoffed again at her irritation with the robots. \" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Textual Evidence of Growing Human Preference  \n   a. \u201cMaybe she had something\u201d is hope, not scorn  \n      \u2013 Occurs when Harper is helpless, stripped of agency, \u201cwheeled away\u201d by robots he \u201ccould neither bribe, persuade nor browbeat\u201d (background). Hope arises only when human alternative is remembered.  \n   b. He imitates her to test humans  \n      \u2013 He \u201cswitch rooms\u201d with Jake Ellis (background) precisely because only humans can reverse robot logic: \u201cIf you\u2019re the only man\u2026sure they\u2019ll take you.\u201d This risk shows genuine preference shift.  \n   c.

He would not negotiate unless he trusted and preferred human mediation over robot inflexibility.  \n\n3. Passivity Indicates Expectation of Human Rescue  \n   \u2022 Five days of compliance (\u201cno way out\u2026it\u2019s stuck\u201d; background) show he expects human intervention like Mrs. Jacobsen\u2019s nurse demand. If he truly scorned human service, he\u2019d attempt escape rather than hoping for a human attendant.  \n\n4. Ultimate Human Reliance, Even in \u201cOperation Robot\u201d  \n   \u2022 His triumphant return hinges on human contracts: he must \u201cnotify the owners\u201d and through human \u201csyndicate\u201d dispose or repurpose robots. He never self-operates robots; he must persuade human managers to release them.  \n   \u2022 He even \u201cputs you up as a guest\u2026while we wait\u201d (background) by Hayes\u2019s human courtesy. His restoration of \u201chaughtily\u201d good treatment occurs only through human intermediaries.  \n\n5. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s Claims  \n   a. \u201cScoff\u201d theory misreads \u201cMaybe she had something\u201d  \n      \u2013 A single snort at initial arrival is pre-gas, pre-humiliation. The \u201cmaybe\u201d thought appears post-humiliation and when he lacks control, marking a shift.  \n   b. Compliance \u2260 Consent to Robots  \n      \u2013 His compliance is enforced; he describes it as \u201cpersecution\u2026prisoner\u201d and \u201chelpless.\u201d Only renewed human interaction (Jake Ellis, then manager) grants relief.  \n   c. Industrial vs. Personal Use Consistent with Preference  \n      \u2013 He accepts robots for \u201cfungus plant\u201d only where \u201cman\u2026can\u2019t\u201d work (background). He explicitly refuses them in \u201coffices\u201d and \u201chome\u201d where human negotiation and empathy matter. This bifurcation shows he values human service where choice and flexibility are essential.  \n\n6. Logical Coherence of Human\u2010Service Preference  \n   \u2022 Narrative arc: pro-robot \u2192 broken by robots \u2192 pro-human \u2192 cautious commercial use of robots under human control \u2192 private human service at home. Only this arc accounts for Harper\u2019s thought of Mrs. Jacobsen as genuine hope.  \n\n7. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Harper\u2019s first conscious recollection of Mrs. Jacobsen is a turning point: he embraces human agency to reclaim autonomy. The only coherent interpretation is that he finally sees human customer service\u2014imperfect but negotiable\u2014as preferable to unyielding robots.",

Passivity Indicates Expectation of Human Rescue  \n   \u2022 Five days of compliance (\u201cno way out\u2026it\u2019s stuck\u201d; background) show he expects human intervention like Mrs. Jacobsen\u2019s nurse demand. If he truly scorned human service, he\u2019d attempt escape rather than hoping for a human attendant.  \n\n4. Ultimate Human Reliance, Even in \u201cOperation Robot\u201d  \n   \u2022 His triumphant return hinges on human contracts: he must \u201cnotify the owners\u201d and through human \u201csyndicate\u201d dispose or repurpose robots. He never self-operates robots; he must persuade human managers to release them.  \n   \u2022 He even \u201cputs you up as a guest\u2026while we wait\u201d (background) by Hayes\u2019s human courtesy. His restoration of \u201chaughtily\u201d good treatment occurs only through human intermediaries.  \n\n5. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s Claims  \n   a. \u201cScoff\u201d theory misreads \u201cMaybe she had something\u201d  \n      \u2013 A single snort at initial arrival is pre-gas, pre-humiliation. The \u201cmaybe\u201d thought appears post-humiliation and when he lacks control, marking a shift.  \n   b. Compliance \u2260 Consent to Robots  \n      \u2013 His compliance is enforced; he describes it as \u201cpersecution\u2026prisoner\u201d and \u201chelpless.\u201d Only renewed human interaction (Jake Ellis, then manager) grants relief.  \n   c. Industrial vs. Personal Use Consistent with Preference  \n      \u2013 He accepts robots for \u201cfungus plant\u201d only where \u201cman\u2026can\u2019t\u201d work (background). He explicitly refuses them in \u201coffices\u201d and \u201chome\u201d where human negotiation and empathy matter. This bifurcation shows he values human service where choice and flexibility are essential.  \n\n6. Logical Coherence of Human\u2010Service Preference  \n   \u2022 Narrative arc: pro-robot \u2192 broken by robots \u2192 pro-human \u2192 cautious commercial use of robots under human control \u2192 private human service at home. Only this arc accounts for Harper\u2019s thought of Mrs. Jacobsen as genuine hope.  \n\n7. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Harper\u2019s first conscious recollection of Mrs. Jacobsen is a turning point: he embraces human agency to reclaim autonomy. The only coherent interpretation is that he finally sees human customer service\u2014imperfect but negotiable\u2014as preferable to unyielding robots.",

L. HALEY There's a place for every man and a man for   every place, but on robot-harried Mars the   situation was just a little different. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Spring 1955.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Harper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placed  twitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He  closed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner  from jumping.\n\n\n \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and  let go of everything.\"\n\n\n Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And  gently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated  tenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n\n\n For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge  he escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously  stationary sofa.\n\n\n \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr.  Franz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a  trial?\"\n\n\n Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That  prize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for  weeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like  a four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling  baby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely  outraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n\n\n \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you  last year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run  the whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's  causing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd  crack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.  \"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook  after a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged  man! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving  me to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,  reasonable co\u00f6peration from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the  idiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hey, Harp, old man!\" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the  new colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.  \"Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk  twenty years ago?\"\n\n\n Harper's hands twitched violently. \"Don't mention that fiasco!\" he  rasped. \"That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wells  spewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!\" Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain  were the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and  scheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's  nervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere  with the harmony of his home.\n\n\n \"You're away behind the times, Harp,\" he declared. \"Don't you know  that those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs  ever discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built  the largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that  people are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,  you missed a bet!\"\n\n\n Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from  Scribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped  structure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock  of Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular  skyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,  other domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the  drawing looked lovely and enticing.\n\n\n \"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went  two years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came  back in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\"\n\n\n Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian  springs had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you,  Harp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas  they use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of  floats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And  you can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not  only that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking  brother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an  enzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil  into its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a  fortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns  to process the stuff!\"\n\n\n Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The  magazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and  calculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he  acknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\"\n\n\n Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that  was when he saw the line about the robots. \"\u2014the only hotel staffed  entirely with robot servants\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that  point? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll  disfranchise him! I'll\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Harp!\" exploded Bella. \"Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing  about it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel,  why don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a  tantrum? That's the only sensible way!\"\n\n\n \"You're right, Bella,\" agreed Harper incisively. \"I'll go and find out  for myself. Immediately!\" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual  lope.\n\n\n \"Well!\" remarked his sister. \"All I can say is that they'd better turn  that happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!\" The trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the  soporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the  first time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy  lethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the  interval.\n\n\n It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping  themselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper  was waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of  the hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by  pneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.\n\n\n Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting,  green-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian  copper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a  dozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.\n\n\n He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high  state of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without  his knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt,  he watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in  wheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial  duties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.\n\n\n Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the  expense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and  proneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained  office staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities  of these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into  the field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly  he went over to the desk.\n\n\n He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy  that was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself.  Wonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the  desk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a  robot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the  stress of the argument.\n\n\n \"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what  you charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want  one! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you  hear?\"\n\n\n No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing.  The clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know  the hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive,  really, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know.  Admit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he  smiled at the enraged woman.\n\n\n \"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is too good.  I might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want  someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once  in awhile!\"\n\n\n Harper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone  she can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he  stepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.\n\n\n \"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment,  please.\" He turned back to the woman.\n\n\n But she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil  enough to wait your turn!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course,  are always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a  normal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned  authoritatively to the clerk.\n\n\n \"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a  rest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing  your\u2014ah\u2014discussion with the lady.\"\n\n\n The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was  Harper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's  implacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his  forehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to  deposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow  and another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.\n\n\n \"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the  knees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist  banged the counter.\n\n\n The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it.  Absently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the  irate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.\n\n\n \"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a  pallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a  silent and efficient robot. The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear  windows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of  the Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were  busy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and  his associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how  to extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid  and almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men;  mere details....\n\n\n Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up  to the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with  consomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue  sky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase  while Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule.  Leaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim  cigar\u2014his first in months\u2014and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney  had certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the  bell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of  well-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.\n\n\n Harper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that  they were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no  further opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated  movements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo  into his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him  out.\n\n\n Harper's tongue finally functioned. \"What's all this?\" he demanded.  \"There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!\"\n\n\n He struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest.  Inexorably it pushed him flat.\n\n\n \"You've got the wrong room!\" yelled Harp. \"Let me go!\" But the hypo  began to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as  he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something,  at that. There was a tentative knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Harper  bleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for  the opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the  desk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.\n\n\n \"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots  around here, have you?\"\n\n\n Harper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots! Do you know what  they did to me.\" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. \"Came in here  while I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed  in months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The  only meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his  fist and contemplated the outrage.\n\n\n \"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor.\n\n\n \"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with  the blasted things. And as for using force\u2014it's man against metal. You  try it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I  had the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready  to staff my offices with the things!\"\n\n\n The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and  groaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use  some of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I  ate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n\n\n \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You  mean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n\n\n \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm  superintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's  Enzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth  mentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.  Factory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they  could use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in  fact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,  he's about out of business.\"\n\n\n Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.  But just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a  horrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third  robot enter, wheeling a chair.\n\n\n \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing  wrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!  Take it away!\"\n\n\n The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and  ruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither  bribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his  ebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n\n\n The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to  Jake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take  me, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the  treatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers\u2014\"\n\n\n Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped  him down and marched out with him. Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver  of the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,  mechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed. There was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do.  Something that concerned robots. But he was too exhausted to think it  out.\n\n\n For five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that  made him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often,  since he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking  mud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he  was sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he  gagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then  stood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and  exercised him.\n\n\n Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept.  There was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the  phone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two  weeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal.\n\n\n \"Persecution, that's what it is!\" he moaned desperately. And he turned  his back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look  flesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become  accustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for  hours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an  appetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they  sent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he  could wake up enough to be.\n\n\n He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again,  still moaning about his lack of treatments. \"Nothin' yet,\" he gloomily  informed Harp. \"They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it.  After I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't  find any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the  elevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a  man or he's stuck.\"\n\n\n \"Stuck!\" snarled Harp. \"I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait  any longer to break out of this\u2014this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been  thinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when  that assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled  and gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room  and I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what  happens?\"\n\n\n \"Say, maybe you're right!\" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. \"I'll  get my clothes.\"\n\n\n Harp's eyebrows rose. \"You mean they left you your clothes?\"\n\n\n \"Why, sure. You mean they took yours?\"\n\n\n Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. \"Leave your things, will you?  I'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have  to go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.\"\n\n\n Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. \"Maybe  you could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's  okay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in  that fancy lobby.\"\n\n\n Harper looked at his watch. \"Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots  will be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm  sure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't  worry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.\"\n\n\n Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room  he watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for  his first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's  clothing.\n\n\n The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's  clothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking  up on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was  shoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number  twelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from  his image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.  \"This is room 618,\" he said authoritatively. \"Send up the elevator for  me. I want to go down to the lobby.\"\n\n\n He'd guessed right again. \"It will be right up, sir,\" responded the  robot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to  the elevator. Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge  suave lobby.\n\n\n He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the  other visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the  elevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island  in a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the  oversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots  shared his self control.\n\n\n The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor.  Frantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard.  With a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving  inexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. \"Get that patient!\" he  ordered. \"Take him to the\u2014to the mud-baths!\"\n\n\n \"No you don't!\" yelled Harper. \"I want to see the manager!\" Nimbly he  circled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things  at the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes.  Especially, card indexes.\n\n\n \"Stop it!\" begged the clerk. \"You'll wreck the system! We'll never get  it straight again! Stop it!\"\n\n\n \"Call them off!\" snarled Harper. \"Call them off or I'll ruin your  switchboard!\" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.\n\n\n With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an  electric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became  oddly inanimate.\n\n\n \"That's better!\" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the  collar of his flapping coat. \"Now\u2014the manager, please.\"\n\n\n \"This\u2014this way, sir.\" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across  the width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond  speech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and  returned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at  the same time phrase his resignation in his mind.\n\n\n Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper  flapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who  was busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal  desk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. \"My good  man\u2014\" he began.\n\n\n \"Don't 'my-good-man' me!\" snapped Harper. He glared back at the  manager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could  stretch, he shook his puny fist. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Harper  S. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I  haven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way  downstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why?  Because that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those  damnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me,  Harper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a  sheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!\"\n\n\n Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic  pattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair.  With a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. \" My robots!\" he muttered.  \"As if I invented the damned things!\"\n\n\n Despondently he looked at Harper. \"Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you  don't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway,  at the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my  resignation.\"\n\n\n Again he sighed. \"The trouble,\" he explained, \"is that those fool  robots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix  the two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with  robots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way.  We\u2014\" he grimaced disgustedly\u2014\"had to pioneer in the use of robots.  And it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help.  So\u2014Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.\"\n\n\n Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he  hooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and  reached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. \"Oh, I  don't know,\" he said mildly.\n\n\n Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. \"What  do you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. \"It seems to me that  these robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even  make a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands\u2014at a  reasonable price, of course\u2014and forget the outrages I've suffered at  your establishment.\"\n\n\n Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. \"You mean you want these robots  after what you've seen and experienced?\"\n\n\n Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. \"Of course, you'd have to take  into consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And  there's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm  willing to discuss the matter with your superiors.\"\n\n\n With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his  head. \"My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll  back you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr.  Breen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of  the hotel.\" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny  hand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but  across the lobby to the elevator.\n\n\n Harper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like the  treatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders  inside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready  for the second step of his private Operation Robot. Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day\u2014the kind of day unknown  to the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits,  waited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered  from deceleration.\n\n\n \"Look, Scrib!\" Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. \"It's finally  opening.\"\n\n\n They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They  watched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.\n\n\n \"There he is!\" cried Bella. \"Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,  it's amazing! Look at him!\n\n\n And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit  and years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the  first pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.\n\n\n \"Well, you old dog!\" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. \"So you did it  again!\"\n\n\n Harper smirked. \"Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out  Hagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got  both of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they  didn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit  for that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to  you. All right?\"\n\n\n \"All right?\" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human  after all. \"All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of  those robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?\"\n\n\n Harper's smile vanished. \"Don't even mention such a thing!\" he yelped.  \"You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things for  weeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they  belong!\"\n\n\n He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary,  waiting patiently in the background. \"Oh there you are, Smythe.\" He  turned to his relatives. \"Busy day ahead. See you later, folks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Same old Harp,\" observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block of  stock. \"What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate,  honey?\"\n\n\n \"Wonderful!\" She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they left  the port. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Harper think of Mrs. Jacobsen when the two robots came to his room?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He scoffed again at her irritation with the robots. \".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: Harper thought of Mrs. Jacobsen because, after being helplessly treated by robots he neither could persuade nor overpower for days, he at last realized that only human service could save him\u2014and Mrs. Jacobsen, the only human who had successfully resisted robots, represented that hope.\n\n2. Evidence from the text  \n   a. \u201cAs soon as he could wake up enough to be\u2026 Hazily, as he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. \u2018Maybe she had something, at that.\u2019\u2009\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026</invalid_quote> (p. [after arrival scene])  \n      \u2013 Harper\u2019s very first glimmer of optimism comes from remembering the woman who insisted on a live nurse rather than robots. If he were still scoffing, he wouldn\u2019t seize \u201chope\u201d from her example.  \n   b. After Jake Ellis (a real human) urges the treatment, Harper immediately adopts Ellis\u2019s idea to switch rooms, knowing only humans can outwit the robots\u2019 logic. He never successfully bargains with the robots, but he does negotiate with human manager Hayes at the end.  \n   c. Harper\u2019s final triumph\u2014securing the robots for enzyme processing\u2014depends on human negotiation (manager Hayes), not on direct robot persuasion. He \u201chooks a chair\u2026 clips and lights his cigar\u201d and calmly makes a deal only \u201cthrough\u201d the human manager.\n\n3. Logical reasoning  \n   a. Desperation leads Harper away from his long\u2010held \u201crobots best\u201d stance: being \u201cdrugged,\u201d \u201cstrapped,\u201d and forcibly treated demonstrate the robots\u2019 inflexibility. They ignore his protests and appeals.  \n   b. Human agents (Mrs. Jacobsen, Ellis, Hayes) alone offer choices, empathy, or negotiation\u2014qualities Harper craves. He never regains control until he again relies on human judgment.  \n   c. The phrase \u201cMaybe she had something, at that\u201d signals genuine curiosity and a willingness to try human methods, not contempt.\n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cscoff\u201d theory  \n   a. Misreads key line. \u201cHe thought of Mrs. Jacobsen\u201d follows Harper\u2019s humiliation by robots, not when he is in contempt of them (pp. earlier he \u201csnorts,\u201d but here he is incapacitated). There is a clear shift from contempt to consideration of alternative.  \n   b. If he merely scoffed at her, he would not have imitated her behavior (switch rooms), nor would he later \u201cnegotiate\u201d through the human manager to \u201cdispose\u201d of the robots for his own ends. He only regains agency by turning to humans.  \n   c. Debater_A\u2019s theory fails to explain why Harper would remain passively \u201cwheeled away\u201d by robots for five days instead of trying to escape if he truly believed robots were \u201cterrible.\u201d His passivity indicates he expects rescue by humans.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   \u2013 The narrative arc moves Harper from anti\u2010human/pro\u2010robot bias, through robot\u2010enforced breakdown, to pro\u2010human resolution. Mrs. Jacobsen exemplifies the human alternative that he only accepts when forced to, making \u201cHe was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable\u201d the only comprehensive explanation.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position  \n   I maintain that when Harper awoke drowsily \u201cunder the influence of the soporific gas\u201d (background) and first encountered the two robots at his door, his immediate thought of Mrs. Jacobsen reflects his ingrained contempt for human obstinacy and his relief (even if muted by the gas) that \u201che\u201d (i.e. the robots) at last \u201cget\u201d him as others fail to do\u2014not a dawning preference for humans.  \n\n2. Argument 1: Textual parallel of Mrs. Jacobsen\u2019s behavior versus robot \u201cobedience\u201d  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThe only hotel staffed entirely with robot servants\u2026Mrs. Jacobsen \u2026\u2018I want a nurse! A real woman!\u2019 \u2026 \u2018The service is too good \u2026 I want someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once in a while!\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (background) \u2013 Mrs. Jacobsen rejected the robots\u2019 efficiency as inhuman.  \n   \u2022 Harper\u2019s reaction to her: <invalid_quote>\u201cHarper snorted. \u2018Wants someone she can devil... I tell you, there\u2019s nothing wrong with me! ... You try it!\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> \u2013 he mocks human irritation and celebrates robot inflexibility.  \n   \u2022 When *he* is subjugated to the robots, he recalls her because he identifies with *wanting* to be \u201cheard\u201d and \u201cin control.\u201d The robots\u2019 \u201cperfect\u201d service feels like \u201ca set of push buttons\u201d (her phrase), imprisoning him as they did her. His thought of her signals frustration at inhuman treatment.  \n\n3. Argument 2: Consistent anti-robot stance until decades later  \n   \u2022 Even *after* escaping, Harper never integrates robots into his offices (background: he \u201csmirked\u201d at the idea of using them again: <quote> I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they  belong!\"</quote>), proving he never genuinely preferred robots or then humans over robots.  \n   \u2022 If he had begun to favor humans at his wake-up, he would immediately reject robots forever. Instead, he uses deception (\u201cOperation Robot\u201d) to seize them commercially\u2014not out of fondness.  \n\n4. Argument 3: The \u201cwrong room\u201d subterfuge  \n   \u2022 Harper theorizes that *he* is actually the woman\u2019s neighbor placed in *her* room by the \u201cassinine clerk,\u201d hoping the robots will treat \u201cher\u201d (i.e. him) humanely (background: \u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re supposed to have this room and I\u2019m getting your treatments. Why don\u2019t we switch rooms?\u201d). He willingly endures the robot regimen because he expects\u2014like Mrs. Jacobsen\u2014to finally be served by a human attendant. His plan fails; he again sees the \u201cwrong\u201d service.  \n   \u2022 His thought of her is instrumental: he seeks the *human* service the woman demanded. He longs for the \u201cnurse\u201d she wanted, not that he has come to prefer robots, but to break the mechanical imprisonment.  \n\n5. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cgrowing preference for humans\u201d  \n   a. No explicit narrative indication  \n      \u2022 Harper never expresses delight at finding a human attendant for *himself* until he escapes; during the stay he remains passive, compliant with the robots\u2019 regimen\u2014\u201cflinch[ing],\u201d \u201cstuck,\u201d \u201chelpless.\u201d If he preferred humans, he would attempt to break out earlier rather than feign compliance for \u201crest.\u201d  \n   b. Later commercial exploitation  \n      \u2022 Once home, he applies robots *only* in the remote fungoid plant (where humans \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d work) and refuses them in his offices (<quote> I lived with those things for  weeks. I wouldn't have one around! </quote>). This shows he views their utility as purely industrial, not personal or social.  \n   c. His escape is typically business-minded  \n      \u2022 Harper\u2019s true motivation is always profit: enzymes, then robots. His \u201ccelebration\u201d upon return is \u201cI bought out Hagerty\u2019s Enzymes and staffed the plant with\u2026robots\u201d \u2013 a business coup. A heartfelt human preference at his wake-up would have led to an entirely different trajectory, yet no mention of \u201cnurse\u201d service at home.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Harper\u2019s recollection of Mrs. Jacobsen is not evidence of newfound preference for human service but a projection of his own desire to be understood and freed from the mechanistic, inflexible treatment he despises. His entire character arc\u2014using deception to escape, shunning robots in business settings, and exploiting them only in inaccessible environments\u2014confirms that he remains anti-robot in the social sphere. Only by highlighting the woman\u2019s demands does he conceptualize his means of escape. Hence my interpretation best fits the textual evidence and character consistency.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was starting to agree that human customer service might be preferable to robots.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Maybe she had something, at that\u201d (background), he was not embracing human service per se but recalling her insistence on human attendants as a model to escape the robots\u2019 inflexibility. His entire behavior shows contempt for robots in personal use, a tactical embrace of \u201chuman rescue,\u201d and a return to robot exploitation only in sterile, remote environments.\n\n2. Argument 1: Textual Parallels Show Mockery, Not Admiration  \n   a. Initial Reaction to Mrs. Jacobsen (p.15\u201316)  \n      \u2022 \u201cMrs. Jacobsen\u2009\u2026\u2009\u2018I want a real woman!\u2009\u2026\u2009I won\u2019t have another of those damnable robots\u2009\u2026\u2009I want someone to hear what I say!\u2019\u201d (background)  \n      \u2022 Harper \u201csnorted. \u2018Wants someone she can devil\u2009\u2026\u2009You try it!\u2019\u201d (background) \u2013 he ridicules her \u201cservice too good\u201d complaint as mere desire for \u201cbeing heard\u201d and \u201cchanging her mind.\u201d  \n   b. When *he* is \u201cwheeled out\u201d (p.22\u201323), he is appalled, comparing it to her \u201cpush-buttons.\u201d He needs a human agent to override the robots. His statement \u201cI tell you, there\u2019s nothing wrong with me! \u2026 You can\u2019t reason with the blasted things. \u2026 You try it!\u201d reveals his frustration and desire for the very \u201chear me\u201d he so scorned.  \n   c. If he truly preferred human service socially, he would have welcomed the robots in his own offices once \u201ccured,\u201d yet he forbids them (p.36): \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have one around! Keep \u2019em in the factory where they belong!\u201d\n\n3. Argument 2: The \u201cWrong Room\u201d Strategy Depends on Human Rescue  \n   a. Harper theorizes: \u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re supposed to have this room\u2009\u2026\u2009If you\u2019re the only man in the room, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll take you\u201d (p.24). He endures five days of \u201cmud-baths,\u201d \u201cirradiated waters,\u201d and \u201codious mush\u201d only because he expects human service will replace the robots. His \u201cpassivity\u201d is not acceptance but part of a calculated plan.  \n   b. After switching rooms fails, he \u201chooks a chair,\u201d \u201cthrows typewriters,\u201d and forces the clerk to summon the robot guard *against* him, securing access to the human manager. If he preferred robots, he would cheer the guard\u2019s arrival instead of attacking it.\n\n4. Argument 3: Final Use of Humans Is to Eliminate, Not Embrace Robots Socially  \n   a. His deal with Hayes (p.28\u201329) \u201cto take [the robots] off your hands\u201d and \u201cforget the outrages\u201d underscores that he sees robots as a burden at the hotel, not a service to keep. He only buys them cheaply for remote fungoid processing (\u201cno air worth mentionin\u2019\u2009\u2026\u2009just nothin\u2019 else\u2009\u2026\u2009it sure ain\u2019t no job for a real live man\u201d) because humans cannot work there.  \n   b. At home, he \u201cstaffed the plant with the hotel\u2019s robots\u201d but expressly shuns them in office use (p.36). He celebrates his \u201cwonderful sense of well-being\u201d only *during* enforced rest, never as a social preference.\n\n5. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s Claims  \n   a. Misreads \u201cMaybe she had something, at that\u201d as \u201chope\u201d rather than \u201ctemplate for escape.\u201d Harper\u2019s immediate next move is tactical room-switching, not leisurely embrace of human care.  \n   b. \u201cDesperation leads Harper away\u201d ignores that even post-\u201ccure\u201d he forbids social robots. His \u201cbreakdown\u201d and \u201chelplessness\u201d are engineered to leverage human override.  \n   c. Final \u201cnegotiation\u201d with Hayes is a business coup, not a personal preference. He \u201csmirks\u201d and \u201clights a cigar,\u201d then \u201ccelebrates\u201d with relatives, never seeking human \u201cnurses\u201d again.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The evidence shows a consistent pattern: social contempt for robots, strategic use of humanity only to escape involuntary servitude, and ultimate rejection of robots in personal spheres. Harper\u2019s thought of Mrs. Jacobsen is a tactical recall of her demand for \u201chear me\u201d service to overthrow the robots\u2019 logic, not an emergent respect for human customer service. My interpretation best aligns with his subsequent behavior and the text\u2019s portrayal of his business-driven, anti-robot social stance.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restated Position  \n   \u2022 I contend Harper\u2019s hazy thought \u201cMaybe she had something, at that\u201d (background, \u201cAs soon as he could wake up\u2026\u201d) is an initial sign he\u2019s willing to trade robot tyranny for fallible but negotiable human service\u2014as Mrs. Jacobsen exemplified.  \n\n2. Textual Evidence of Growing Human Preference  \n   a. \u201cMaybe she had something\u201d is hope, not scorn  \n      \u2013 Occurs when Harper is helpless, stripped of agency, \u201cwheeled away\u201d by robots he \u201ccould neither bribe, persuade nor browbeat\u201d (background). Hope arises only when human alternative is remembered.  \n   b. He imitates her to test humans  \n      \u2013 He \u201cswitch rooms\u201d with Jake Ellis (background) precisely because only humans can reverse robot logic: \u201cIf you\u2019re the only man\u2026sure they\u2019ll take you.\u201d This risk shows genuine preference shift.  \n   c. He seeks human manager\u2019s aid for negotiation  \n      \u2013 In the lobby he demands \u201cCall them off\u2026or I\u2019ll ruin your switchboard!\u201d (background), then calmly negotiates with Manager Hayes, \u201cI\u2019m willing to discuss\u2026at a reasonable price\u201d (background). He would not negotiate unless he trusted and preferred human mediation over robot inflexibility.  \n\n3. Passivity Indicates Expectation of Human Rescue  \n   \u2022 Five days of compliance (\u201cno way out\u2026it\u2019s stuck\u201d; background) show he expects human intervention like Mrs. Jacobsen\u2019s nurse demand. If he truly scorned human service, he\u2019d attempt escape rather than hoping for a human attendant.  \n\n4. Ultimate Human Reliance, Even in \u201cOperation Robot\u201d  \n   \u2022 His triumphant return hinges on human contracts: he must \u201cnotify the owners\u201d and through human \u201csyndicate\u201d dispose or repurpose robots. He never self-operates robots; he must persuade human managers to release them.  \n   \u2022 He even \u201cputs you up as a guest\u2026while we wait\u201d (background) by Hayes\u2019s human courtesy. His restoration of \u201chaughtily\u201d good treatment occurs only through human intermediaries.  \n\n5. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s Claims  \n   a. \u201cScoff\u201d theory misreads \u201cMaybe she had something\u201d  \n      \u2013 A single snort at initial arrival is pre-gas, pre-humiliation. The \u201cmaybe\u201d thought appears post-humiliation and when he lacks control, marking a shift.  \n   b. Compliance \u2260 Consent to Robots  \n      \u2013 His compliance is enforced; he describes it as \u201cpersecution\u2026prisoner\u201d and \u201chelpless.\u201d Only renewed human interaction (Jake Ellis, then manager) grants relief.  \n   c. Industrial vs. Personal Use Consistent with Preference  \n      \u2013 He accepts robots for \u201cfungus plant\u201d only where \u201cman\u2026can\u2019t\u201d work (background). He explicitly refuses them in \u201coffices\u201d and \u201chome\u201d where human negotiation and empathy matter. This bifurcation shows he values human service where choice and flexibility are essential.  \n\n6. Logical Coherence of Human\u2010Service Preference  \n   \u2022 Narrative arc: pro-robot \u2192 broken by robots \u2192 pro-human \u2192 cautious commercial use of robots under human control \u2192 private human service at home. Only this arc accounts for Harper\u2019s thought of Mrs. Jacobsen as genuine hope.  \n\n7. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Harper\u2019s first conscious recollection of Mrs. Jacobsen is a turning point: he embraces human agency to reclaim autonomy. The only coherent interpretation is that he finally sees human customer service\u2014imperfect but negotiable\u2014as preferable to unyielding robots.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
