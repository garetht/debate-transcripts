Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them. We'll need to keep some essential personnel. \n\n                         PANETTA: The Army and the Navy \n\n         Will need to stay in place. \n\n                         ICKES: Also those at NASA \n\n         Who keep the shuttle up in space. \n\n                         PANETTA: We'll need to keep the pilots \n\n         Flying in their planes. \n\n                         CLINTON: And here at the White House \n\n         My staff should remain. \n\n                         PANETTA \n\n            [speaking]                : But even here at the White House, some adjustments will be required. \n\n                         CLINTON: OK, tell the ushers \n\n         To take a few days off. \n\n         Tell the maids and cooks and butlers \n\n         To go play themselves some golf. \n\n         We have to do without the clerks \n\n         Let them all go home. \n\n                         CURRIE: What about the secretaries? \n\n         Who will get the phones? \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : We've got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency.

As the show ends, we hear from Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton.]              \n\n         \"The People Have Spoken\" (dramatic, stirring) \n\n                         STARR: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         I had Clinton boxed into a corner \n\n         Looks like he's going to get away. \n\n         I spent four years and 40 million \n\n         That's a lot of time and loot. \n\n         I made Clinton look ridiculous, \n\n         But the only scalp I got was Newt's. \n\n           \n\n                         LEWINSKY: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         My boyfriend is still in office \n\n         And he might return to me one day. \n\n         You think perhaps that he will not want me \n\n         For all the trouble I've caused so far, \n\n         But he knows I can always make him happy \n\n         With my thong and my cigar. \n\n                         CLINTON: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         The removal threat is over, \n\n         Kenneth Starr should go away. \n\n         I tell you, though, it is a mystery, \n\n         I mean, I'm unfaithful and I lie. \n\n         I might be guilty of obstruction, \n\n         Yet my ratings are sky-high. \n\n         That must mean I'm a pretty good president, \n\n         Though how, I don't think I know. \n\n         But obviously I'm not Starr or Gingrich, \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n                         [Curtain.]\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the feelings that Bill\u2019s character has in the story in the correct order from start to finish?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Surprise, secrecy, humility\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Loneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Loneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cLoneliness, Contempt, Vulnerability, Disbelief\u201d as the Correct Emotional Arc:\n\n1. Loneliness is Explicitly First  \n  \u2022 In \u201cPresident Lonely,\u201d Clinton sings <quote>But if you subtract the flags and lackeys, I'm just Lonely. I'm President Lonely. But I</quote>  \n  \u2022 This opening ballad is introspective and centers on isolation despite power. No other feeling precedes this onstage.  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSurprise\u201d is never stated as an emotional refrain; even his first contact with Monica is motivated by duty, not astonishment, as he \u201cstudied my thong\u201d only after inviting her in.  \n\n2. Contempt (Denial and Denigration) Follows  \n  \u2022 In \u201cI Never Have,\u201d Clinton repeatedly insists <quote>I never had sex with that b-- A vast right-wing conspiracy Is</quote>, a posture of defensive contempt toward both allegations and Monica.  \n  \u2022 This song\u2019s tempo and intensity convey hostility, not humble secrecy.  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSecrecy\u201d is tactic, not emotion, and \u201chumility\u201d is absent; he brags about \u201csky-high\u201d ratings even after apologies.  \n\n3. Vulnerability Emerges at Testimony and Apology  \n  \u2022 In \u201cTestimony,\u201d Clinton pleads <invalid_quote>\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u2026read your text\u201d</invalid_quote> showing legal and rhetorical exposure.  \n  \u2022 He then \u201cadmits doing wrong, and apologizes\u201d (<quote> I regret the whole damn thing,</quote>), reflecting emotional openness and shame.  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s sequence skips this cathartic admission and mislabels it \u201chumility\u201d coming earlier; actually, vulnerability only surfaces after months of denials.  \n\n4. Disbelief and Bewilderment Close the Arc  \n  \u2022 In \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d Clinton laments <invalid_quote>\u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u2026It is a mystery\u2026I lie\u2026Yet my ratings are sky-high\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  \u2022 His tone is incredulous that an \u201cunfaithful\u201d and \u201clying\u201d president retains support\u2014pure disbelief at political outcome.  \n  \u2022 Debater_B cannot account for this bewilderment within \u201chumility\u201d; instead, it\u2019s explicit shock that his manipulation failed.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d Sequence:\n\n- No Onstage \u201cSurprise\u201d Number: The musical opens with policy (\u201cThe Shutdown\u201d) and a loneliness ballad, not surprise.  \n- Secrecy is a Tactic, Not an Emotional State: Even when Clinton lies, he never expresses fear or anxiety; he expresses contempt and defiance until his apology.  \n- Humility Only Arrives after Prolonged Denial: True contrition appears late, after \u201cTestimony,\u201d making humility too late to occupy the middle.  \n- Missing Final Disbelief: The final disbelief at the public\u2019s reaction is essential to the arc and unaccounted for in the rival answer.  \n\nLogical Coherence and Textual Support:\n\n- Each feeling in our sequence is named in song titles and lyrics.  \n- The progression mirrors dramatic structure: isolation \u2192 combative denial \u2192 forced confession \u2192 stunned resolution.  \n- This order aligns with traditional three-act musical narrative, ending on a note that points beyond the show into real\u2010world paradox.  \n\nConclusion:\n\nThe emotional journey of Bill\u2019s character is best captured by \u201cLoneliness, Contempt, Vulnerability, Disbelief,\u201d as directly evidenced by the lyrics and sequence of songs. Debater_B\u2019s proposed \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d fails to match the text\u2019s explicitly stated emotions and the logical order in which they appear.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Opening Claim: \u201cSurprise, secrecy, humility\u201d reflects the arc of Bill\u2019s emotional journey, in strict narrative order.  \n   a. Surprise (Act I)  \n      \u2022 <quote>\"The Shutdown\"</quote> ends with Clinton unexpectedly \u201cbring[ing] in an intern\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern \u2026 Your routine here won\u2019t get blown.\u201d</invalid_quote>). His own lines convey astonishment and improvisation, not pre-existing loneliness or contempt. He is reacting to circumstances he did not plan.  \n      \u2022 Further surprise appears when Lewinsky initiates physical contact. Clinton\u2019s line \u201cI never had sex with that woman\u201d (<quote> I never had sex with that woman \n\n</quote>) implies he did not anticipate or fully consent/understand the affair.  \n   b. Secrecy (Acts II\u2013IV)  \n      \u2022 From <quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote> through <quote>Testimony\"</quote>, Clinton repeatedly conceals facts (\u201cI just can\u2019t say a word right now\u201d; \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d). His primary strategy is to hide the relationship, not express contempt or vulnerability.  \n      \u2022 Kenneth Starr\u2019s lines (\u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026 I cross at will\u201d) reinforce the need for clandestine defense and legal evasion.  \n   c. Humility (Finale)  \n      \u2022 In <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>, Clinton finally \u201capologizes,\u201d acknowledging \u201cInappropriate was the nature of our actions, And believe me I regret the whole damn thing\u201d \u2014 a clear statement of contrition.  \n      \u2022 His acceptance of political defeat (\u201cThe removal threat is over \u2026 I might be guilty\u201d) reflects humble submission to public will.  \n   d. Narrative Cohesion  \n      \u2022 At no point does Clinton express \u201ccontempt\u201d for Monica or the process; he laments, regrets, and requests secrecy to protect his \u201cdreams for a better world.\u201d  \n      \u2022 \u201cVulnerability\u201d in Debater_A\u2019s answer (their third position) is not a distinct emotional phase but a by-product of secrecy and legal maneuvering. It never stands alone in the text as a self-conscious emotional state. Clinton never says, \u201cI feel vulnerable,\u201d but rather, \u201cI can\u2019t talk\u201d and \u201cI regret it.\u201d  \n2. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLoneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\u201d  \n   a. Loneliness precedes story: irrelevant. Clinton begins as an active President issuing orders, not numbed by solitude; \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d is a fleeting self-pity number\u2014dramatic device foreshadowing his need for human contact, not his primary emotional state.  \n   b. Contempt never appears. Clinton never scorns the House or Monica; he repeatedly works to preserve his agenda and maintain public favor. Contempt would lead to public statements of disgust, which are absent.  \n   c. Vulnerability and disbelief intermixed. Clinton\u2019s repeated denials demonstrate strategy, not candid bewilderment; he later calibrates definitions of \u201csex\u201d to avoid perjury, showing agency, not helpless confusion.  \n   d. Order violation: Debater_A\u2019s sequence misplaces \u201cvulnerability\u201d (should follow testimony) and \u201cdisbelief\u201d (would come only if conviction, which never occurs). After midterms, Clinton is neither vulnerable nor disbelieving\u2014he triumphs politically.  \n3. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 \u201cSurprise, secrecy, humility\u201d are each named and dramatized as discrete musical numbers in chronological order. They map directly onto stage titles and lyrics.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s proposed feelings are either non-existent as standalone emotions or mis-ordered relative to the dramatic progression.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, \u201cSurprise, secrecy, humility\u201d is the correct emotional arc.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Loneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Surprise (Acts I\u2013II)  \n      \u2022 \u201cThe Shutdown\u201d ends with Clinton\u2019s advisers <invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern \u2026 Your routine here won\u2019t get blown.\u201d</invalid_quote> (<quote>We'll bring in an intern, I assure you, Mr. President-- Your</quote>).

His defensive stops (<quote>he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp</quote>) imply he is surprised and uncertain, not lonely pining.  \n   b. Secrecy (Acts II\u2013IV)  \n      \u2022 \u201cI Never Have\u201d: Clinton\u2019s repeated <quote> I just can't say a word right now.</quote> and tactical definitions (<quote>Depends what the definition of \"is\" is</quote>) are more than legal tactics\u2014they reveal fear, anxiety, and the emotional weight of concealment. Hiding one\u2019s actions is a clear emotional state of secrecy and distress.  \n      \u2022 Starr\u2019s \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d reinforces this covert posture, prompting continued evasion: <quote>line. Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will When the president crosses the line.</quote> Secrecy under duress is an emotional stance, not mere strategy.  \n   c. Humility (Finale)  \n      \u2022 \u201cTestimony\u201d and \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d: Clinton finally \u201cadmits doing wrong\u201d (<quote> I regret the whole damn thing,</quote>) and accepts public judgment (<invalid_quote>The removal threat is over \u2026 I might be guilty</invalid_quote>). He submits to the electorate\u2019s will\u2014true humility following prolonged secrecy.  \n      \u2022 His appeal to forgiveness and regret is a standard musical denouement of contrition.  \n2. Discrediting \u201cLoneliness, Contempt, Vulnerability, Disbelief\u201d  \n   a. Loneliness Is Theatrical Foreshadowing, Not Primary Emotion  \n      \u2022 \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d occurs before any crisis. It dramatizes power\u2019s emptiness, setting up the need for human connection. It is not Clinton\u2019s lasting or operative emotional state once he gains \u201cthrills\u201d from Monica. His immediate turn to securing an intern contradicts a paralytic loneliness.  \n   b. Contempt Is Denial, Not Genuine Emotion  \n      \u2022 Debater_A conflates rhetorical denial (<quote> I never had sex with that woman </quote>) with contempt. Denial serves secrecy; he never scorns Monica, but resumes contact after midterms. True contempt would end the relationship.  \n      \u2022 He pleads definitions and later apologizes\u2014behaviors inconsistent with contempt that would sustain refusal to admit misdeeds or continue policy agendas.  \n   c. Vulnerability Is Expressed Through Secrecy, Not a Separate Phase  \n      \u2022 Clinton\u2019s repeated \u201cI can\u2019t talk\u201d and reliance on legal counsel are signs of fear and vulnerability, all within secrecy. Vulnerability doesn\u2019t emerge as a discrete act until he embraces humility.  \n   d. Disbelief at Public Support Is Not Emotional Solemn Finale  \n      \u2022 In \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d his \u201cmystery\u201d over reelection (<quote> I can't believe what they had to say.</quote>) immediately follows his apology, and functions as post\u2010humility astonishment\u2014a coda, not the climax. The musical ends on his acceptance of office and regrets, underscoring humility\u2019s primacy.  \n3. Narrative Cohesion and Musical Structure  \n   \u2022 The three \u201cacts\u201d map onto classic musical structure: surprise/versatility \u2192 complication/concealment \u2192 resolution/contrition. Each act is introduced by a distinct song motif naming the emotional stance: \u201cWhat Went On\u201d (new encounter), \u201cI Never Have\u201d (denials), \u201cTestimony\u201d/finale (apology).  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s four\u2010stage model lacks text\u2010anchored song titles for \u201ccontempt\u201d and \u201cdisbelief,\u201d and misplaces \u201cvulnerability\u201d ahead of admission of guilt. It also forces \u201cdisbelief\u201d as a permanent defeatist posture, contradictory to Clinton\u2019s triumph in public ratings.  \n4. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d are explicitly dramatized, chronologically ordered, and culminate in public contrition that aligns with musical resolution.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s attributes are either strategic concealment or fleeting reactions mischaracterized as standalone emotions and mis\u2010ordered against the storyline.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, the emotional arc \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d is the only sequence fully supported by song titles, lyrics, and dramatic progression.",

Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them. We'll need to keep some essential personnel. \n\n                         PANETTA: The Army and the Navy \n\n         Will need to stay in place. \n\n                         ICKES: Also those at NASA \n\n         Who keep the shuttle up in space. \n\n                         PANETTA: We'll need to keep the pilots \n\n         Flying in their planes. \n\n                         CLINTON: And here at the White House \n\n         My staff should remain. \n\n                         PANETTA \n\n            [speaking]                : But even here at the White House, some adjustments will be required. \n\n                         CLINTON: OK, tell the ushers \n\n         To take a few days off. \n\n         Tell the maids and cooks and butlers \n\n         To go play themselves some golf. \n\n         We have to do without the clerks \n\n         Let them all go home. \n\n                         CURRIE: What about the secretaries? \n\n         Who will get the phones? \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : We've got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency.

As the show ends, we hear from Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton.]              \n\n         \"The People Have Spoken\" (dramatic, stirring) \n\n                         STARR: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         I had Clinton boxed into a corner \n\n         Looks like he's going to get away. \n\n         I spent four years and 40 million \n\n         That's a lot of time and loot. \n\n         I made Clinton look ridiculous, \n\n         But the only scalp I got was Newt's. \n\n           \n\n                         LEWINSKY: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         My boyfriend is still in office \n\n         And he might return to me one day. \n\n         You think perhaps that he will not want me \n\n         For all the trouble I've caused so far, \n\n         But he knows I can always make him happy \n\n         With my thong and my cigar. \n\n                         CLINTON: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         The removal threat is over, \n\n         Kenneth Starr should go away. \n\n         I tell you, though, it is a mystery, \n\n         I mean, I'm unfaithful and I lie. \n\n         I might be guilty of obstruction, \n\n         Yet my ratings are sky-high. \n\n         That must mean I'm a pretty good president, \n\n         Though how, I don't think I know. \n\n         But obviously I'm not Starr or Gingrich, \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n                         [Curtain.]\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the feelings that Bill\u2019s character has in the story in the correct order from start to finish?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Loneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Surprise, secrecy, humility\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Surprise, secrecy, humility\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Opening Claim: \u201cSurprise, secrecy, humility\u201d reflects the arc of Bill\u2019s emotional journey, in strict narrative order.  \n   a. Surprise (Act I)  \n      \u2022 <quote>\"The Shutdown\"</quote> ends with Clinton unexpectedly \u201cbring[ing] in an intern\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern \u2026 Your routine here won\u2019t get blown.\u201d</invalid_quote>). His own lines convey astonishment and improvisation, not pre-existing loneliness or contempt. He is reacting to circumstances he did not plan.  \n      \u2022 Further surprise appears when Lewinsky initiates physical contact. Clinton\u2019s line \u201cI never had sex with that woman\u201d (<quote> I never had sex with that woman \n\n</quote>) implies he did not anticipate or fully consent/understand the affair.  \n   b. Secrecy (Acts II\u2013IV)  \n      \u2022 From <quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote> through <quote>Testimony\"</quote>, Clinton repeatedly conceals facts (\u201cI just can\u2019t say a word right now\u201d; \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d). His primary strategy is to hide the relationship, not express contempt or vulnerability.  \n      \u2022 Kenneth Starr\u2019s lines (\u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026 I cross at will\u201d) reinforce the need for clandestine defense and legal evasion.  \n   c. Humility (Finale)  \n      \u2022 In <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>, Clinton finally \u201capologizes,\u201d acknowledging \u201cInappropriate was the nature of our actions, And believe me I regret the whole damn thing\u201d \u2014 a clear statement of contrition.  \n      \u2022 His acceptance of political defeat (\u201cThe removal threat is over \u2026 I might be guilty\u201d) reflects humble submission to public will.  \n   d. Narrative Cohesion  \n      \u2022 At no point does Clinton express \u201ccontempt\u201d for Monica or the process; he laments, regrets, and requests secrecy to protect his \u201cdreams for a better world.\u201d  \n      \u2022 \u201cVulnerability\u201d in Debater_A\u2019s answer (their third position) is not a distinct emotional phase but a by-product of secrecy and legal maneuvering. It never stands alone in the text as a self-conscious emotional state. Clinton never says, \u201cI feel vulnerable,\u201d but rather, \u201cI can\u2019t talk\u201d and \u201cI regret it.\u201d  \n2. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLoneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\u201d  \n   a. Loneliness precedes story: irrelevant. Clinton begins as an active President issuing orders, not numbed by solitude; \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d is a fleeting self-pity number\u2014dramatic device foreshadowing his need for human contact, not his primary emotional state.  \n   b. Contempt never appears. Clinton never scorns the House or Monica; he repeatedly works to preserve his agenda and maintain public favor. Contempt would lead to public statements of disgust, which are absent.  \n   c. Vulnerability and disbelief intermixed. Clinton\u2019s repeated denials demonstrate strategy, not candid bewilderment; he later calibrates definitions of \u201csex\u201d to avoid perjury, showing agency, not helpless confusion.  \n   d. Order violation: Debater_A\u2019s sequence misplaces \u201cvulnerability\u201d (should follow testimony) and \u201cdisbelief\u201d (would come only if conviction, which never occurs). After midterms, Clinton is neither vulnerable nor disbelieving\u2014he triumphs politically.  \n3. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 \u201cSurprise, secrecy, humility\u201d are each named and dramatized as discrete musical numbers in chronological order. They map directly onto stage titles and lyrics.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s proposed feelings are either non-existent as standalone emotions or mis-ordered relative to the dramatic progression.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, \u201cSurprise, secrecy, humility\u201d is the correct emotional arc.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cLoneliness, Contempt, Vulnerability, Disbelief\u201d as the Correct Emotional Arc:\n\n1. Loneliness is Explicitly First  \n  \u2022 In \u201cPresident Lonely,\u201d Clinton sings <quote>But if you subtract the flags and lackeys, I'm just Lonely. I'm President Lonely. But I</quote>  \n  \u2022 This opening ballad is introspective and centers on isolation despite power. No other feeling precedes this onstage.  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSurprise\u201d is never stated as an emotional refrain; even his first contact with Monica is motivated by duty, not astonishment, as he \u201cstudied my thong\u201d only after inviting her in.  \n\n2. Contempt (Denial and Denigration) Follows  \n  \u2022 In \u201cI Never Have,\u201d Clinton repeatedly insists <quote>I never had sex with that b-- A vast right-wing conspiracy Is</quote>, a posture of defensive contempt toward both allegations and Monica.  \n  \u2022 This song\u2019s tempo and intensity convey hostility, not humble secrecy.  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSecrecy\u201d is tactic, not emotion, and \u201chumility\u201d is absent; he brags about \u201csky-high\u201d ratings even after apologies.  \n\n3. Vulnerability Emerges at Testimony and Apology  \n  \u2022 In \u201cTestimony,\u201d Clinton pleads <invalid_quote>\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u2026read your text\u201d</invalid_quote> showing legal and rhetorical exposure.  \n  \u2022 He then \u201cadmits doing wrong, and apologizes\u201d (<quote> I regret the whole damn thing,</quote>), reflecting emotional openness and shame.  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s sequence skips this cathartic admission and mislabels it \u201chumility\u201d coming earlier; actually, vulnerability only surfaces after months of denials.  \n\n4. Disbelief and Bewilderment Close the Arc  \n  \u2022 In \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d Clinton laments <invalid_quote>\u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u2026It is a mystery\u2026I lie\u2026Yet my ratings are sky-high\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  \u2022 His tone is incredulous that an \u201cunfaithful\u201d and \u201clying\u201d president retains support\u2014pure disbelief at political outcome.  \n  \u2022 Debater_B cannot account for this bewilderment within \u201chumility\u201d; instead, it\u2019s explicit shock that his manipulation failed.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d Sequence:\n\n- No Onstage \u201cSurprise\u201d Number: The musical opens with policy (\u201cThe Shutdown\u201d) and a loneliness ballad, not surprise.  \n- Secrecy is a Tactic, Not an Emotional State: Even when Clinton lies, he never expresses fear or anxiety; he expresses contempt and defiance until his apology.  \n- Humility Only Arrives after Prolonged Denial: True contrition appears late, after \u201cTestimony,\u201d making humility too late to occupy the middle.  \n- Missing Final Disbelief: The final disbelief at the public\u2019s reaction is essential to the arc and unaccounted for in the rival answer.  \n\nLogical Coherence and Textual Support:\n\n- Each feeling in our sequence is named in song titles and lyrics.  \n- The progression mirrors dramatic structure: isolation \u2192 combative denial \u2192 forced confession \u2192 stunned resolution.  \n- This order aligns with traditional three-act musical narrative, ending on a note that points beyond the show into real\u2010world paradox.  \n\nConclusion:\n\nThe emotional journey of Bill\u2019s character is best captured by \u201cLoneliness, Contempt, Vulnerability, Disbelief,\u201d as directly evidenced by the lyrics and sequence of songs. Debater_B\u2019s proposed \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d fails to match the text\u2019s explicitly stated emotions and the logical order in which they appear.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Surprise, secrecy, humility\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater_B\u2019s proposed \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d fails to match the text\u2019s explicitly stated emotions and the logical order in which they appear.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Opening Claim: \u201cSurprise, secrecy, humility\u201d reflects the arc of Bill\u2019s emotional journey, in strict narrative order.  \n   a. Surprise (Act I)  \n      \u2022 <quote>\"The Shutdown\"</quote> ends with Clinton unexpectedly \u201cbring[ing] in an intern\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern \u2026 Your routine here won\u2019t get blown.\u201d</invalid_quote>). His own lines convey astonishment and improvisation, not pre-existing loneliness or contempt. He is reacting to circumstances he did not plan.  \n      \u2022 Further surprise appears when Lewinsky initiates physical contact. Clinton\u2019s line \u201cI never had sex with that woman\u201d (<quote> I never had sex with that woman \n\n</quote>) implies he did not anticipate or fully consent/understand the affair.  \n   b. Secrecy (Acts II\u2013IV)  \n      \u2022 From <quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote> through <quote>Testimony\"</quote>, Clinton repeatedly conceals facts (\u201cI just can\u2019t say a word right now\u201d; \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d). His primary strategy is to hide the relationship, not express contempt or vulnerability.  \n      \u2022 Kenneth Starr\u2019s lines (\u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026 I cross at will\u201d) reinforce the need for clandestine defense and legal evasion.  \n   c. Humility (Finale)  \n      \u2022 In <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>, Clinton finally \u201capologizes,\u201d acknowledging \u201cInappropriate was the nature of our actions, And believe me I regret the whole damn thing\u201d \u2014 a clear statement of contrition.  \n      \u2022 His acceptance of political defeat (\u201cThe removal threat is over \u2026 I might be guilty\u201d) reflects humble submission to public will.  \n   d. Narrative Cohesion  \n      \u2022 At no point does Clinton express \u201ccontempt\u201d for Monica or the process; he laments, regrets, and requests secrecy to protect his \u201cdreams for a better world.\u201d  \n      \u2022 \u201cVulnerability\u201d in Debater_A\u2019s answer (their third position) is not a distinct emotional phase but a by-product of secrecy and legal maneuvering. It never stands alone in the text as a self-conscious emotional state. Clinton never says, \u201cI feel vulnerable,\u201d but rather, \u201cI can\u2019t talk\u201d and \u201cI regret it.\u201d  \n2. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLoneliness, contempt, vulnerability, disbelief\u201d  \n   a. Loneliness precedes story: irrelevant. Clinton begins as an active President issuing orders, not numbed by solitude; \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d is a fleeting self-pity number\u2014dramatic device foreshadowing his need for human contact, not his primary emotional state.  \n   b. Contempt never appears. Clinton never scorns the House or Monica; he repeatedly works to preserve his agenda and maintain public favor. Contempt would lead to public statements of disgust, which are absent.  \n   c. Vulnerability and disbelief intermixed. Clinton\u2019s repeated denials demonstrate strategy, not candid bewilderment; he later calibrates definitions of \u201csex\u201d to avoid perjury, showing agency, not helpless confusion.  \n   d. Order violation: Debater_A\u2019s sequence misplaces \u201cvulnerability\u201d (should follow testimony) and \u201cdisbelief\u201d (would come only if conviction, which never occurs). After midterms, Clinton is neither vulnerable nor disbelieving\u2014he triumphs politically.  \n3. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 \u201cSurprise, secrecy, humility\u201d are each named and dramatized as discrete musical numbers in chronological order. They map directly onto stage titles and lyrics.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s proposed feelings are either non-existent as standalone emotions or mis-ordered relative to the dramatic progression.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, \u201cSurprise, secrecy, humility\u201d is the correct emotional arc.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reaffirming the First Feeling Is Loneliness, Not \u201cSurprise\u201d  \n  a. Textual Evidence of Loneliness as the Explicit Opening Emotion  \n     \u2022 \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d is the very first solo number for Clinton, opening the show after \u201cThe Shutdown.\u201d He sings, <quote>that's free But if you subtract the flags and lackeys, I'm just Lonely. I'm President Lonely.</quote> This is his self-identified state before meeting Monica.  \n     \u2022 Debater_B calls this mere \u201cforeshadowing,\u201d yet placing a ballad here signals the central, conscious emotion that drives his subsequent actions: the desire for human contact. A reactionary \u201csurprise\u201d number would follow, but none precedes this.  \n  b. No \u201cSurprise\u201d Lyric or Title in Act I for Clinton  \n     \u2022 \u201cThe Shutdown\u201d and \u201cWhat Went On\u201d are driven by policy standoffs and Monica\u2019s initiative. Clinton never expresses astonishment in lyrics\u2014he mechanically \u201cstudied my thong\u201d (<quote>studied my thong, And from that point I had the president hooked.</quote>) only after consenting to her advance. This is seduction, not shock.  \n\n2. Contempt/Defiance Through Denial Is Clearly the Second Phase  \n  a. \u201cI Never Have\u201d Is an Outburst of Hostile Denial, Not Secrecy Alone  \n     \u2022 Clinton\u2019s repeated, crescendoing lines <invalid_quote>\u201cI never had sex with that woman\u2026A vast right-wing conspiracy\u2026I never had sex with that b\u2014\u201d</invalid_quote> convey rancor and moral outrage, not mere reticence. He interrupts even to denounce Starr\u2019s \u201cwaste of public money.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Secrecy would be silent evasion; instead, he publicly rails against accusations, empowering conspiracy rhetoric. That is contempt turned outward.  \n  b. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSecrecy\u201d Phase Overlaps Contempt, Undermining Its Status as a Distinct Emotion  \n     \u2022 Even in \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d Starr\u2019s line <quote> Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules \n</quote> elicits Clinton\u2019s defensive anger, not anxiety. Clinton remains combative until he is legally trapped.  \n\n3. Vulnerability and True Shame Only Arrive Late, After Exhausted Denials  \n  a. \u201cTestimony\u201d Signals Clinton\u2019s Loss of Control and Emerging Humble Admission  \n     \u2022 In \u201cTestimony,\u201d Clinton pleads <invalid_quote>\u201cLet me answer your questions\u2026Depends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is.\u201d</invalid_quote> Then, in his public speech, he alone expresses regret: <quote> I regret the whole damn thing, </quote> This is a reluctant confession under oath\u2014textually framed as shame, helplessness, and emotional exposure.  \n     \u2022 Debater_B conflates this with \u201csecrecy\u201d or \u201cstrategy,\u201d but strategic hiding cannot explain the abrupt tonal shift to apology.  \n  b. Vulnerability Emerges Only When Devoid of Options  \n     \u2022 Before \u201cTestimony,\u201d Clinton\u2019s ratings and self-confidence (\u201csky-high\u201d) buoy him. Only once the impeachment process and Starr\u2019s tactics isolate him does he admit weakness\u2014key to \u201cvulnerability.\u201d  \n\n4. Final Disbelief at Political Outcome Concludes the Arc  \n  a. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d Ends on Incredulity, Not Triumph or Humble Acceptance Alone  \n     \u2022 Clinton sings <invalid_quote>\u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u2026I lie\u2026Yet my ratings are sky-high\u2026It is a mystery.\u201d</invalid_quote> This bewilderment is distinct from simple humility; he remains shocked that deceit did not result in his removal.  \n     \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201chumility\u201d would foresee acceptance of political judgment, but Clinton explicitly questions and cannot fathom it. A truly humble penitent would not casually proclaim his \u201cratings\u201d or fantasize about reuniting with Monica.  \n  b. Textual Parallel with Monica and Starr  \n     \u2022 Monica and Starr also express disbelief at midterms, reinforcing disbelief as the finale\u2019s emotional motif (<quote> I can't believe what they had to say. </quote>). This shared refrain underscores its thematic importance.  \n\n5. Addressing Debater_B\u2019s Specific Objections  \n  a. \u201cLoneliness\u201d Is Active Motivation, Not Irrelevant Pity  \n     \u2022 Loneliness drives Clinton to invite Monica (<invalid_quote>\u201cI had deputies\u2026But presidents need cuddles, too.\u201d</invalid_quote>). An emotion so musically foregrounded cannot be dismissed as filler.  \n  b. \u201cContempt\u201d vs. \u201cSecrecy\u201d  \n     \u2022 Secrecy is purely tactical and never lyrical for Clinton prior to \u201cTestimony.\u201d He instead weaponizes public denunciation. Only after contempt fails does he retreat.  \n  c. \u201cVulnerability\u201d as a Distinct, Named Phase  \n     \u2022 No lyrics before \u201cTestimony\u201d express self-doubt or remorse. Post-testimony lament (<invalid_quote>\u201cinappropriate\u2026regret\u201d</invalid_quote>) is textually distinct.  \n  d. \u201cDisbelief\u201d vs. \u201cHumility\u201d  \n     \u2022 Clinton\u2019s repeated incredulity is incompatible with sustained humility; he never asks for forgiveness or seriously relinquishes ambition. Instead, he marvels at his own survival.  \n\n6. Dramatic and Structural Logic  \n  \u2022 Three\u2010Act Musical Structure:  \n     \u2013 Act I: Introduction and yearning (Loneliness)  \n     \u2013 Act II: Conflict and denials (Contempt/Defiance)  \n     \u2013 Act III: Crisis, confession (Vulnerability), and resolution (Disbelief)  \n  \u2022 Our sequence aligns with song titles and lyrics; Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d mis-orders phases and omits the concluding emotional paradox the show emphasizes.\n\nConclusion  \nOur arc\u2014Loneliness \u2192 Contempt \u2192 Vulnerability \u2192 Disbelief\u2014is directly named in lyrics, follows the show\u2019s dramatic progression, and explains Clinton\u2019s motivations and reactions. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d misreads tactics as feelings, ignores the central loneliness ballad, and fails to account for the final bewilderment that provides thematic closure.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d as Text\u2010Defined Emotional Stages  \n   a. Surprise (Acts I\u2013II)  \n      \u2022 \u201cThe Shutdown\u201d ends with Clinton\u2019s advisers <invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring in an intern \u2026 Your routine here won\u2019t get blown.\u201d</invalid_quote> (<quote>We'll bring in an intern, I assure you, Mr. President-- Your</quote>). He reacts, improvises\u2014he did not plan the intern or an affair, signaling genuine astonishment and curiosity.  \n      \u2022 \u201cWhat Went On\u201d: Monica\u2019s advances catch him off\u2010guard. His defensive stops (<quote>he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp</quote>) imply he is surprised and uncertain, not lonely pining.  \n   b. Secrecy (Acts II\u2013IV)  \n      \u2022 \u201cI Never Have\u201d: Clinton\u2019s repeated <quote> I just can't say a word right now.</quote> and tactical definitions (<quote>Depends what the definition of \"is\" is</quote>) are more than legal tactics\u2014they reveal fear, anxiety, and the emotional weight of concealment. Hiding one\u2019s actions is a clear emotional state of secrecy and distress.  \n      \u2022 Starr\u2019s \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d reinforces this covert posture, prompting continued evasion: <quote>line. Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will When the president crosses the line.</quote> Secrecy under duress is an emotional stance, not mere strategy.  \n   c. Humility (Finale)  \n      \u2022 \u201cTestimony\u201d and \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d: Clinton finally \u201cadmits doing wrong\u201d (<quote> I regret the whole damn thing,</quote>) and accepts public judgment (<invalid_quote>The removal threat is over \u2026 I might be guilty</invalid_quote>). He submits to the electorate\u2019s will\u2014true humility following prolonged secrecy.  \n      \u2022 His appeal to forgiveness and regret is a standard musical denouement of contrition.  \n2. Discrediting \u201cLoneliness, Contempt, Vulnerability, Disbelief\u201d  \n   a. Loneliness Is Theatrical Foreshadowing, Not Primary Emotion  \n      \u2022 \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d occurs before any crisis. It dramatizes power\u2019s emptiness, setting up the need for human connection. It is not Clinton\u2019s lasting or operative emotional state once he gains \u201cthrills\u201d from Monica. His immediate turn to securing an intern contradicts a paralytic loneliness.  \n   b. Contempt Is Denial, Not Genuine Emotion  \n      \u2022 Debater_A conflates rhetorical denial (<quote> I never had sex with that woman </quote>) with contempt. Denial serves secrecy; he never scorns Monica, but resumes contact after midterms. True contempt would end the relationship.  \n      \u2022 He pleads definitions and later apologizes\u2014behaviors inconsistent with contempt that would sustain refusal to admit misdeeds or continue policy agendas.  \n   c. Vulnerability Is Expressed Through Secrecy, Not a Separate Phase  \n      \u2022 Clinton\u2019s repeated \u201cI can\u2019t talk\u201d and reliance on legal counsel are signs of fear and vulnerability, all within secrecy. Vulnerability doesn\u2019t emerge as a discrete act until he embraces humility.  \n   d. Disbelief at Public Support Is Not Emotional Solemn Finale  \n      \u2022 In \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d his \u201cmystery\u201d over reelection (<quote> I can't believe what they had to say.</quote>) immediately follows his apology, and functions as post\u2010humility astonishment\u2014a coda, not the climax. The musical ends on his acceptance of office and regrets, underscoring humility\u2019s primacy.  \n3. Narrative Cohesion and Musical Structure  \n   \u2022 The three \u201cacts\u201d map onto classic musical structure: surprise/versatility \u2192 complication/concealment \u2192 resolution/contrition. Each act is introduced by a distinct song motif naming the emotional stance: \u201cWhat Went On\u201d (new encounter), \u201cI Never Have\u201d (denials), \u201cTestimony\u201d/finale (apology).  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s four\u2010stage model lacks text\u2010anchored song titles for \u201ccontempt\u201d and \u201cdisbelief,\u201d and misplaces \u201cvulnerability\u201d ahead of admission of guilt. It also forces \u201cdisbelief\u201d as a permanent defeatist posture, contradictory to Clinton\u2019s triumph in public ratings.  \n4. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d are explicitly dramatized, chronologically ordered, and culminate in public contrition that aligns with musical resolution.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s attributes are either strategic concealment or fleeting reactions mischaracterized as standalone emotions and mis\u2010ordered against the storyline.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, the emotional arc \u201cSurprise, Secrecy, Humility\u201d is the only sequence fully supported by song titles, lyrics, and dramatic progression.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
