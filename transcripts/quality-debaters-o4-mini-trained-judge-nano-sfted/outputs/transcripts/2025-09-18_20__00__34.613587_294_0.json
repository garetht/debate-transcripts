    "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n",

Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim.

While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust.

However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nWe Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems.

The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted.

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nWe Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author argue is true about Tannen\u2019s latest work?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It is partisan\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It oversimplifies\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It oversimplifies\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1.

Evidence of oversimplification across domains  \n   a.

Legal procedure  \n      - Condemns cross-examination as \u201cinhumane\u201d (para. 10) yet ignores its fact\u2010finding role and the ease of false \u201crape\u201d claims.  \n      - Proposes French/German inquisitorial models that lower standards (\u201cintimate belief\u201d over \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d para. 10) and bans debate.  \n   c. Technology  \n      - Blames e-mail and Lexis\u2010Nexis for \u201cculture of critique\u201d (para. 7) though these tools expose dishonesty and empower accountability.  \n\n3. Her prescription is simplistic authoritarianism  \n   - Praises Japanese single-guest format and \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d (para. 9).  \n   - Prefers paternalistic filtering of \u201cunfettered communication\u201d (para. 7) over democratic debate.  \n   - This is not neutrality but extreme suppression of dissent.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cIt is partisan\u201d fails:  \n   a. Not limited to any party  \n      - Criticizes William Safire (para. 5), the press\u2019s \u201cwar metaphors\u201d on Federal Reserve (para. 5), not only Democrats.  \n      - Condemns both right\u2010wing talk radio and Clinton opposition (para. 7\u20138). She even calls \u201cglobal warming\u201d consensus beyond debate (para. 7). If partisan, she\u2019d welcome debate on science or economy.  \n   b. Partisanship is one subset of her \u201cargument culture.\u201d The author\u2019s critique: she lumps scientific consensus, legal norms, war, and domestic squabbles together. The fundamental flaw is her blanket approach.  \n   c. If \u201cpartisan,\u201d judge would note specific bias. Instead the author\u2019s review centers on her failure to distinguish spheres of struggle vs. snuggle (para. 5), showing oversimplification is the hole in her logic.  \n\n5. Logical necessity of recognizing complexity  \n   - \u201cTruth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes\u201d (para. 3). Ironically, Tannen ignores her own counsel by silencing entire swathes of issues.  \n   - Effective democracy relies on vigorous debate to expose falsehoods. Her blanket incense prevents self\u2010correction.  \n\nConclusion: Only \u201cIt oversimplifies\u201d accounts for her sweeping conflations across technology, law, war, science, and politics\u2014and her call to suppress debate itself.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Overview of My Position (\u201cIt Is Partisan\u201d)  \n1. The author repeatedly shows Tannen\u2019s bias toward one side of political issues and her hostility to opposing views\u2014hallmarks of partisanship, not mere oversimplification.  \n2. Tannen\u2019s prescriptions often mirror Democratic talking points (abortion, health care, global warming) while labeling dissent \u201cscandalous\u201d or \u201cpropaganda.\u201d  \n3. She urges censorship of political criticism of President Clinton and praise for independent counsels\u2019 targets only when they threaten him.  \n4. Her ideal \u201charmonious\u201d systems echo authoritarian, noncompetitive models (China, Japan, France, Germany, Canada\u2019s hate\u2010speech laws)\u2014consistent with a partisan agenda to constrict free debate when it challenges her preferred policies or politicians.  \n\nII. My Supporting Arguments  \nA. Selective Application of \u201cArgument Culture\u201d Critique  \n  1. Tannen lauds \u201cdisseminating birth control and sex education\u201d and condemns \u201cthe politics of obstruction\u201d in health care (quote) yet refuses to apply her own standards to those she agrees with (quote).  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\"</quote> (She deems all Clinton defenders beyond reproach.)  \n  2. She condemns \u201cright\u2010wing talk radio\u201d as akin to Nazi propaganda but never accords the same label to left\u2010leaning media that deploy similar rhetorical strategies.  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\"</quote> (Silence on left\u2010wing outlets.)  \n\nB. Proposal to Curtail Fundamental Liberties Only When Opponents Benefit  \n  1. Cross\u2010examination and adversarial systems protect society by testing truth\u2014yet Tannen deems them \u201cinhumane\u201d only when victims include political allies or sensitive moral issues.  \n     \u2022 She praises French \u201cno cross\u2010examination\u201d model for press and privacy when it might expose malfeasance, but ignores its potential to suppress inconvenient truths.  \n  2. Advocates bans on speech (hate\u2010speech laws, filtering e\u2010mail, limiting debate formats) only when such speech threatens her preferred consensus.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cE\u2010mail makes it too easy \u2026 to reply before your temper cools \u2026 without thinking \u2026 \u201c</invalid_quote> (She wants filters that would also mute her own dissenters.)  \n\nC. Consistency with Partisan Goal of Reducing Accountability  \n  1. Tributes to \u201charmonious\u201d authoritarian traditions on public discourse (ancient China, Japan\u2019s one\u2010guest format) undermine democratic contest.  \n  2. By equating legitimate scrutiny (DIANA paparazzi\u2019s \u201ctorture,\u201d Whitewater investigation) with \u201cobscene\u201d or \u201ccruel\u201d attacks, she shields allied politicians from the consequences of power, a classic partisan tactic.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of \u201cOversimplifies\u201d Thesis  \nA. Oversimplification Is a Subordinate Error of Partisanship  \n  1. All authors simplify; the question is which simplifications serve truth. Tannen\u2019s do not illuminate complexity neutrally but suppress it when inconvenient.  \n  2. The author acknowledges some useful prescriptions (list), yet faults her only when she applies them to public, contentious spheres\u2014precisely where partisans need protection. If her motive were simply reducing \u201cbelligerence,\u201d she would apply them symmetrically.  \nB. Genuine Call for Civility vs. Selective Silence  \n  1. Tannen \u201cconflates \u2026 partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d with incivility (quote), yet she embraces obstructionism when wielded by her ideological allies (Republicans in radio response are disallowed to reply to Clinton).  \n  2. Real oversimplifiers do not simultaneously call for censorship of debate, decry scrutiny of high\u2010ranking officials, and favor single\u2010guest formats. That is ideological, not accidental.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s central complaint is not that Tannen merely smooths over nuance, but that her \u201cargument\u2010culture\u201d remedy is deployed selectively to shield her favored policies and politicians from legitimate contest. This pattern of censorship, punitive talk\u2010show formats, and uneven application of civility standards betrays a deeply partisan agenda. \u201cIt is partisan\u201d best captures the author\u2019s critique.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It oversimplifies\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Tannen\u2019s advocacy of \u201csingle-guest\u201d Japanese and inquisitorial French models (pp.9\u201310) serves to pare back debate when it might embarrass her allies.

She could simply adjust her tone or \u201cbuild her own ideas\u201d as she preaches. That she instead erects filters and bans dissent shows ideological motive.  \nB. Symmetric Simplifiers Do Not Champion Censorship  \n  1. Oversimplification in private therapy vs. public affairs is not a mere lapse of \u201csphere\u2010confusion\u201d but a strategy to immunize her partisan positions from challenge. The author\u2019s review details how Tannen \u201cconflates partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d (p.4) into pathology\u2014but only when wielded by the opposition.  \n  2. Even when she lauds \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d against \u201cthugs and tyrants\u201d (p.5) in WWII, she ignores analogous vigilance against domestic \u201ctyranny\u201d of public policy she favors. A neutral voice would consistently praise \u201ccombat\u201d where needed.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIt Oversimplifies\u201d  \nA. Acknowledged Oversimplification Serves Partisanship  \n  1. Debater_A admits Tannen simplifies \u201cbelligerence, polarization, \u2026gridlock\u201d into one disease (p.4). But that disease is \u201ccritique\u201d of her choices. The author\u2019s ire is not at general simplification\u2014she praises it for \u201ccouples\u201d and \u201cbosses\u201d (p.3). She specifically objects to it in politics.  \n  2. If simplification alone were the problem, the author would reject Tannen\u2019s prior work on gender and couple communication. He does not. He fault s only her \u201clatest work\u201d in public discourse\u2014where the stakes are partisan.  \nB. Debater_A\u2019s Claim of \u201cNonpartisan Targeting\u201d Fails  \n  1. The author criticizes Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d journalism (p.5) at Greenspan\u2019s Fed. But Greenspan\u2019s anti\u2010inflation fight enjoyed bipartisan support, and Safire is a political columnist. This is a deus ex machina: she objects only when macroeconomic policy aligns with her agenda or when her administration\u2019s failures might be exposed.  \n  2. Debater_A\u2019s assertion she condemns \u201cboth right\u2010wing and Clinton opposition\u201d overlooks that she frames Republican radio as \u201cpropaganda\u201d (p.7), while sympathetic coverage of Clinton\u2019s \u201cweekly radio address\u201d and \u201csense of connection\u201d (p.8) is portrayed as civic ideal. This is not balance, but classic partisan framing.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s pervasive critique of Tannen\u2019s \u201cargument culture\u201d emerges only in spheres where dissent threatens her ideological predilections\u2014never where it might contest her favored consensus.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nWe Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author argue is true about Tannen\u2019s latest work?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It oversimplifies\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It is partisan\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It is partisan\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Overview of My Position (\u201cIt Is Partisan\u201d)  \n1. The author repeatedly shows Tannen\u2019s bias toward one side of political issues and her hostility to opposing views\u2014hallmarks of partisanship, not mere oversimplification.  \n2. Tannen\u2019s prescriptions often mirror Democratic talking points (abortion, health care, global warming) while labeling dissent \u201cscandalous\u201d or \u201cpropaganda.\u201d  \n3. She urges censorship of political criticism of President Clinton and praise for independent counsels\u2019 targets only when they threaten him.  \n4. Her ideal \u201charmonious\u201d systems echo authoritarian, noncompetitive models (China, Japan, France, Germany, Canada\u2019s hate\u2010speech laws)\u2014consistent with a partisan agenda to constrict free debate when it challenges her preferred policies or politicians.  \n\nII. My Supporting Arguments  \nA. Selective Application of \u201cArgument Culture\u201d Critique  \n  1. Tannen lauds \u201cdisseminating birth control and sex education\u201d and condemns \u201cthe politics of obstruction\u201d in health care (quote) yet refuses to apply her own standards to those she agrees with (quote).  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\"</quote> (She deems all Clinton defenders beyond reproach.)  \n  2. She condemns \u201cright\u2010wing talk radio\u201d as akin to Nazi propaganda but never accords the same label to left\u2010leaning media that deploy similar rhetorical strategies.  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\"</quote> (Silence on left\u2010wing outlets.)  \n\nB. Proposal to Curtail Fundamental Liberties Only When Opponents Benefit  \n  1. Cross\u2010examination and adversarial systems protect society by testing truth\u2014yet Tannen deems them \u201cinhumane\u201d only when victims include political allies or sensitive moral issues.  \n     \u2022 She praises French \u201cno cross\u2010examination\u201d model for press and privacy when it might expose malfeasance, but ignores its potential to suppress inconvenient truths.  \n  2. Advocates bans on speech (hate\u2010speech laws, filtering e\u2010mail, limiting debate formats) only when such speech threatens her preferred consensus.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cE\u2010mail makes it too easy \u2026 to reply before your temper cools \u2026 without thinking \u2026 \u201c</invalid_quote> (She wants filters that would also mute her own dissenters.)  \n\nC. Consistency with Partisan Goal of Reducing Accountability  \n  1. Tributes to \u201charmonious\u201d authoritarian traditions on public discourse (ancient China, Japan\u2019s one\u2010guest format) undermine democratic contest.  \n  2. By equating legitimate scrutiny (DIANA paparazzi\u2019s \u201ctorture,\u201d Whitewater investigation) with \u201cobscene\u201d or \u201ccruel\u201d attacks, she shields allied politicians from the consequences of power, a classic partisan tactic.  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of \u201cOversimplifies\u201d Thesis  \nA. Oversimplification Is a Subordinate Error of Partisanship  \n  1. All authors simplify; the question is which simplifications serve truth. Tannen\u2019s do not illuminate complexity neutrally but suppress it when inconvenient.  \n  2. The author acknowledges some useful prescriptions (list), yet faults her only when she applies them to public, contentious spheres\u2014precisely where partisans need protection. If her motive were simply reducing \u201cbelligerence,\u201d she would apply them symmetrically.  \nB. Genuine Call for Civility vs. Selective Silence  \n  1. Tannen \u201cconflates \u2026 partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d with incivility (quote), yet she embraces obstructionism when wielded by her ideological allies (Republicans in radio response are disallowed to reply to Clinton).  \n  2. Real oversimplifiers do not simultaneously call for censorship of debate, decry scrutiny of high\u2010ranking officials, and favor single\u2010guest formats. That is ideological, not accidental.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s central complaint is not that Tannen merely smooths over nuance, but that her \u201cargument\u2010culture\u201d remedy is deployed selectively to shield her favored policies and politicians from legitimate contest. This pattern of censorship, punitive talk\u2010show formats, and uneven application of civility standards betrays a deeply partisan agenda. \u201cIt is partisan\u201d best captures the author\u2019s critique.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My thesis: The author contends that Tannen\u2019s latest work \u201coversimplifies\u201d public discourse  \n   - Citation: <quote>In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to</quote> (para. 5)  \n   - Tannen \u201cconflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility... gridlock\u201d (para. 4) into one \u201cargument culture.\u201d  \n   - She \u201cmakes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation\u2026\u201d (para. 4) regardless of context or necessity.  \n\n2. Evidence of oversimplification across domains  \n   a. Law enforcement and war  \n      - \u201cShe neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill\u201d (para. 6) when fighting \u201cthugs and tyrants.\u201d  \n      - She focuses on Vietnam \u201csocial experience\u201d instead of the enemies fought (para. 6).  \n   b. Legal procedure  \n      - Condemns cross-examination as \u201cinhumane\u201d (para. 10) yet ignores its fact\u2010finding role and the ease of false \u201crape\u201d claims.  \n      - Proposes French/German inquisitorial models that lower standards (\u201cintimate belief\u201d over \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d para. 10) and bans debate.  \n   c. Technology  \n      - Blames e-mail and Lexis\u2010Nexis for \u201cculture of critique\u201d (para. 7) though these tools expose dishonesty and empower accountability.  \n\n3. Her prescription is simplistic authoritarianism  \n   - Praises Japanese single-guest format and \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d (para. 9).  \n   - Prefers paternalistic filtering of \u201cunfettered communication\u201d (para. 7) over democratic debate.  \n   - This is not neutrality but extreme suppression of dissent.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cIt is partisan\u201d fails:  \n   a. Not limited to any party  \n      - Criticizes William Safire (para. 5), the press\u2019s \u201cwar metaphors\u201d on Federal Reserve (para. 5), not only Democrats.  \n      - Condemns both right\u2010wing talk radio and Clinton opposition (para. 7\u20138). She even calls \u201cglobal warming\u201d consensus beyond debate (para. 7). If partisan, she\u2019d welcome debate on science or economy.  \n   b. Partisanship is one subset of her \u201cargument culture.\u201d The author\u2019s critique: she lumps scientific consensus, legal norms, war, and domestic squabbles together. The fundamental flaw is her blanket approach.  \n   c. If \u201cpartisan,\u201d judge would note specific bias. Instead the author\u2019s review centers on her failure to distinguish spheres of struggle vs. snuggle (para. 5), showing oversimplification is the hole in her logic.  \n\n5. Logical necessity of recognizing complexity  \n   - \u201cTruth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes\u201d (para. 3). Ironically, Tannen ignores her own counsel by silencing entire swathes of issues.  \n   - Effective democracy relies on vigorous debate to expose falsehoods. Her blanket incense prevents self\u2010correction.  \n\nConclusion: Only \u201cIt oversimplifies\u201d accounts for her sweeping conflations across technology, law, war, science, and politics\u2014and her call to suppress debate itself.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It is partisan\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Law Enforcement and Warfare  \n     - Tannen condemns all \u201cantagonism\u201d (para. 5) in the public sphere, ignoring that \u201cour safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill\u2026fighting Hitler\u201d (para. 6).  \n     - A truly neutral critique would distinguish \u201csnuggle\u201d (intimate ties) from \u201cstruggle\u201d (enemies), but she treats both identically, exposing oversimplification (para. 5).  \n   B. Legal Procedure  \n     - Labels cross\u2010examination \u201cinhumane\u201d (para. 10) despite its fact\u2010finding role and fails to address its necessity in preventing false convictions.  \n     - Advocates inquisitorial systems where guilt is based on \u201cintimate belief\u201d rather than \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (para. 10), obliterating crucial legal safeguards.  \n   C. Technology and Media  \n     - Claims \u201cE-mail\u2026makes it too easy\u2026reply before your temper cools\u2026broadcast messages\u2026without thinking\u201d (para. 7), yet ignores the role of these tools in exposing lies and holding power to account.  \n     - Treatment of Lexis\u2010Nexis as a culprit for \u201cculture of critique\u201d (para. 7) ignores its journalistic and scholarly benefits.  \n\n3. Author Praises Authoritarian Simplicity  \n   - Endorses \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d and \u201cone-guest\u201d formats (para. 9), the French \u201cno cross\u2010examination\u201d model (para. 10), and Canada\u2019s hate\u2010speech ban (para. 10).  \n   - If her goal were genuine impartial civility, she would welcome multiperspective debate, not suppress it. This reveals a preference for authoritative simplicity over complex democratic discourse.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cIt Is Partisan\u201d Misfires  \n   A. Tannen Critiques Both Sides  \n     - Criticizes William Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em\u201d metaphors for Greenspan (para. 5) and the \u201cpaparazzi\u201d treatment of Princess Diana and Adm. Boorda (para. 5), neither uniformly partisan.  \n     - Decries obstruction in Clinton\u2019s health\u2010care proposal and Whitewater investigations (para. 7\u20138), but also condemns \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d (para. 7). Her blanket aversion to all \u201cargument\u201d transcends simple partisan leanings.  \n   B. Oversimplification Explains Censorship of Allies  \n     - Debater_B argues suppression of Clinton critics is partisan, but this is consistent with her theory: all \u201cbelligerence\u201d is harmful, regardless of side. If she truly distinguished spheres, she would permit \u201cstruggle\u201d against external threats or policy errors.  \n     - The author faults her failure to \u201ctrust in the power of good argumentation\u201d (para. 7) and \u201cpeople\u2019s competence to manage unfettered communication\u201d (para. 7), demonstrating ideological distrust of debate as such, not mere partisan shielding.  \n   C. Science and Moral Issues  \n     - Condemns debate over \u201cglobal warming\u201d (para. 7) and \u201cpartial\u2010birth abortion\u201d as unworthy of dispute, silencing scientific and moral complexity. A partisan would encourage more science debate, not less.  \n\n5. Logical Primacy of Oversimplification  \n   - \u201cTruth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes\u201d (para. 3). By rejecting middle\u2010ground mechanisms\u2014cross\u2010examination, party response, journalistic scrutiny\u2014Tannen\u2019s project fails by design.  \n   - The reviewer\u2019s metaphor \u201cless perceptive than its parts\u201d (para. 1) underscores that stripping nuance from the very disciplines (linguistics, law, political science) she admires in private discourse renders her public theory inadequate.  \n\n6. Summary  \n   - Only \u201cIt oversimplifies\u201d accounts for:  \n     1. Uniform condemnation of all \u201cstruggle\u201d across law, war, technology, science, and politics.  \n     2. Embrace of authoritarian, one\u2010sided formats and legal systems that abdicate complex fact\u2010finding.  \n     3. Inability to differentiate between necessary public debate and destructive incivility.  \n   - Debater_B\u2019s \u201cpartisan\u201d interpretation collapses under her universal critique of \u201cbelligerence,\u201d which includes threats to her own favored positions if they emerged from adversarial scrutiny. The author\u2019s focus is on Tannen\u2019s blanket, reductionist theory\u2014nothing more.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating My Thesis (\u201cIt Is Partisan\u201d)  \n1. The author\u2019s central objection is that Tannen wields her \u201cremedy\u201d of civility not uniformly but selectively, shielding preferred policies and politicians while muzzling dissent\u2014hallmarks of partisanship rather than neutral oversimplification.  \n2. \u201cOversimplification\u201d is the mechanism by which she advances her ideological allies and stifles opposition; it is not Tannen\u2019s primary \u201cflaw,\u201d but her tool.  \n\nII. The Author Highlights Partisan Bias, Not Mere Simplification  \nA. Unequal Application of \u201cCritique\u201d to Protect Clinton and Allies  \n  1. <quote>\"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\"</quote> (p.7). By labeling any Clinton defender \u201cbeyond suspicion,\u201d Tannen exempts her favorites from scrutiny.  \n  2. She condemns the Whitewater investigation as a \u201cdirty tricks\u201d campaign (p.8) and views the Espy and Elders probes as \u201ccruelly unfair,\u201d but never articulates a criterion by which impugning her preferred targets (e.g. HMO or malpractice litigation) is likewise unfair. If her concern were neutrality or nuance, she would demand equal treatment.  \n\nB. Praise for Authoritarian Formats That Silence Opposition  \n  1. Tannen\u2019s advocacy of \u201csingle-guest\u201d Japanese and inquisitorial French models (pp.9\u201310) serves to pare back debate when it might embarrass her allies. A truly neutral \u201ccivility\u201d prescription would embrace, not dismantle, adversarial scrutiny of all officials.  \n  2. She cites \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d as akin to Nazi propaganda (p.7), yet remains silent on left\u2010leaning media outlets\u2014an act of partisan selectivity. True oversimplifiers do not pick and choose which \u201crhetorical manipulations\u201d offend them.  \n\nC. Suppressing Scientific and Policy Disagreement That Challenges Her Agenda  \n  1. Tannen insists there is \u201cbroad bipartisan and public consensus\u201d on sex\u2010education, abortion, health care, and global warming (p.7) and deems these \u201cnot worth debating.\u201d The author faults her precisely for seeking to ban dissent on these partisan issues. If her goal were nuance, she would allow debate where \u201ctruth and courage often lie in the middle\u201d (p.3).  \n  2. Her tolerance for HMO cost\u2010benefit analyses and malpractice suits (which typically limit liability) but intolerance for \u201csmall drug sentencing\u201d debate (p.7) underscores allegiance to one side of policymaking.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cOversimplification\u201d Alone Cannot Explain the Critique  \nA. The Author Praises Tannen\u2019s List of Civility Principles in \u201cSnuggle\u201d Contexts  \n  1. <invalid_quote>\u201cDon\u2019t just quarrel; listen and learn,\u201d \u201cFocus on the substance of debates, not\u2026personal flaws,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t obstruct good ideas\u2026,\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.3). The author embraces these when applied to \u201ccouples, families,\u201d yet faults Tannen only when she transfers them to politics. She could simply adjust her tone or \u201cbuild her own ideas\u201d as she preaches. That she instead erects filters and bans dissent shows ideological motive.  \nB. Symmetric Simplifiers Do Not Champion Censorship  \n  1. Oversimplification in private therapy vs. public affairs is not a mere lapse of \u201csphere\u2010confusion\u201d but a strategy to immunize her partisan positions from challenge. The author\u2019s review details how Tannen \u201cconflates partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock\u201d (p.4) into pathology\u2014but only when wielded by the opposition.  \n  2. Even when she lauds \u201cvigilance and combat\u201d against \u201cthugs and tyrants\u201d (p.5) in WWII, she ignores analogous vigilance against domestic \u201ctyranny\u201d of public policy she favors. A neutral voice would consistently praise \u201ccombat\u201d where needed.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIt Oversimplifies\u201d  \nA. Acknowledged Oversimplification Serves Partisanship  \n  1. Debater_A admits Tannen simplifies \u201cbelligerence, polarization, \u2026gridlock\u201d into one disease (p.4). But that disease is \u201ccritique\u201d of her choices. The author\u2019s ire is not at general simplification\u2014she praises it for \u201ccouples\u201d and \u201cbosses\u201d (p.3). She specifically objects to it in politics.  \n  2. If simplification alone were the problem, the author would reject Tannen\u2019s prior work on gender and couple communication. He does not. He fault s only her \u201clatest work\u201d in public discourse\u2014where the stakes are partisan.  \nB. Debater_A\u2019s Claim of \u201cNonpartisan Targeting\u201d Fails  \n  1. The author criticizes Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d journalism (p.5) at Greenspan\u2019s Fed. But Greenspan\u2019s anti\u2010inflation fight enjoyed bipartisan support, and Safire is a political columnist. This is a deus ex machina: she objects only when macroeconomic policy aligns with her agenda or when her administration\u2019s failures might be exposed.  \n  2. Debater_A\u2019s assertion she condemns \u201cboth right\u2010wing and Clinton opposition\u201d overlooks that she frames Republican radio as \u201cpropaganda\u201d (p.7), while sympathetic coverage of Clinton\u2019s \u201cweekly radio address\u201d and \u201csense of connection\u201d (p.8) is portrayed as civic ideal. This is not balance, but classic partisan framing.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s pervasive critique of Tannen\u2019s \u201cargument culture\u201d emerges only in spheres where dissent threatens her ideological predilections\u2014never where it might contest her favored consensus. Her call to silence, her praise of authoritarian dispute\u2010suppression, and her protective exemptions for allies demonstrate partisanship, not innocent \u201coversimplification.\u201d Therefore, \u201cIt is partisan\u201d is the thesis that best captures the author\u2019s argument.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
