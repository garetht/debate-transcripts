    "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n",

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Europe\u2019s public debts exceed the Maastricht 3% threshold (e.g., Italy at 7.4% vs. U.S. at 1.4%) (\u00b617). By requiring deficits below 3%, the euro plan tackles Europe\u2019s chronic over-indebtedness, promoting long-term stability.  \n  b.

Debater A\u2019s \u201cNo Positives\u201d Thesis Contradicts the Text  \n  a. The author describes abundant \u201cfresh bread and great chocolates\u201d and \u201cwine and flowers, which are cheap\u201d as staples of European daily life (\u00b64). These low prices result from integrated markets and cross-border competition, both enhanced by currency unification. If markets were fragmented by parochial currencies, arbitrage would keep prices high.  \n  b. He admires \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d (\u00b64). The euro underpins cross-border rail and airline services by reducing currency-exchange hassles, making regional travel seamless.  \n  c. His envy of \u201cminiskirts \u2026 acceptable attire\u201d and \u201cInternet \u2026 next communication revolution\u201d underscores desire for European modernization. Currencies lock in commitment to open markets and innovation.  \n\n5. Debater A\u2019s \u201cIncidental Positives\u201d Are Part of the Euro\u2019s Benefits  \n  a. All nominal \u201catmospherics\u201d (cheap wine, transport, tourism-friendly policies) derive from economic integration. Without a unified currency, tourists and cross-border workers would face constant exchange fees, reducing mobility.  \n  b. Healthy competition and economies of scale are only possible in a large monetary union.  \n\n6. Addressing Allegations of Bureaucratic Self-Interest  \n  a. While Eurocrats \u201copenly maneuver for more money and empire\u201d (\u00b618), they nonetheless maintain the currency regime because member states value trade efficiency and fiscal discipline. Were the euro purely a racket, national governments would not have ceded monetary sovereignty despite short-term political pain.  \n  b.

Debater A\u2019s assertion of \u201cno positives\u201d ignores explicit textual support, misreads the author\u2019s cautious praise, and fails to connect incidental amenities to the euro\u2019s enabling role.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters.

Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the positive aspects the author highlights?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by my answer: the author offers no genuine, substantive \u201cpositive aspects\u201d of Europe or the EU project\u2014only isolated, incidental details amid pervasive criticism.  My opponent\u2019s claim that \u201cone currency\u201d is a positive is contradicted by the text itself and by the author\u2019s framing.  I will (1) show that every so-called \u201cpositive\u201d is either incidental, undermined by context, or actually part of the critique, and (2) expose why the euro is portrayed as a self-serving solution, not a genuine benefit.\n\n1. \u201cIncidental Details,\u201d Not Praised Advantages  \n a. Fresh bread, chocolates, cheap wine and flowers (\u00b64)  \n   \u2022 These are \u201cstaples\u201d but never tied to any argument that they improve Europeans\u2019 welfare overall.  \n   \u2022 They serve to illustrate the author\u2019s nostalgic longing (as in the final paragraph), not an endorsement of European vitality.  \n b. Historic buildings (\u00b64)  \n   \u2022 Described as \u201cwell-cared-for,\u201d yet this \u201chistoric preservation\u201d coexists with \u201ccrumbling, generic, enervated\u201d infrastructure (\u00b62).  \n   \u2022 The Berlaymont debacle (\u00b616) shows the EU can\u2019t even manage its own landmark.  \n c. Public transportation (\u00b64)  \n   \u2022 Labeled \u201cexcellent\u201d only to immediately note \u201cmonumental traffic jams\u201d of expensive cars on \u201csmall streets.\u201d The net effect is congestion and decline.\n\n2. The Euro as Self-Aggrandizement, Not Genuine Progress  \n a. Debt-shift and blame-avoidance (\u00b613)  \n   \u2022 \u201cA dirty little secret\u201d is that Europe\u2019s debts exceed the U.S. The euro is a mechanism for governments to \u201cblame foreign interests\u201d rather than reform domestic featherbedding (\u00b613).  \n   \u2022 Far from a crowning achievement, it is depicted as an \u201cangling\u201d strategy.  \n b. Corruption risk (\u00b614)  \n   \u2022 Belgium is \u201csecond-most corrupt\u201d in Europe. Will corruption \u201crub off on the euro\u201d? The author clearly doubts the EU\u2019s competence and integrity.  \n c. Bureaucratic self-interest (\u00b615\u201316)  \n   \u2022 Eurocrats seek \u201cmore money and empire.\u201d Their \u201ccommand center\u201d is an opulent \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power\u201d maintained at taxpayer expense.  \n   \u2022 The Berlaymont closure for nine years at $50 million underscores bureaucratic incompetence.  \n   \u2022 Deregulation is always \u201canticipated\u201d but never delivered; public strikes and monopolies stymie progress (\u00b610\u201311, \u00b612).\n\n3. Pattern of Negative Framing  \n a. Strikes and welfare demands (\u00b67\u20138)  \n   \u2022 Presented as inexplicably popular, \u201cmystery\u201d how Belgium maintains living standards. The welfare model \u201cstymies economies\u201d and doubles U.S. unemployment rates (\u00b68).  \n b. Telecom monopolies (\u00b611)  \n   \u2022 Europe loses the communications revolution to the U.S. through \u201crapacious\u201d monopolies and \u201cbureaucrats\u201d blocking innovation.  \n   \u2022 Call-back services are needed merely to \u201cwork around\u201d European failures.\n\n4. Definition of \u201cPositive Aspect\u201d Requires Endorsement, Not Neutral Mention  \n \u2022 The author\u2019s tone is uniformly critical. Isolated pleasant details serve his comparative narrative (\u201cwhen, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d \u00b64) and personal nostalgia, not an argument for Europe\u2019s future as a model.  \n \u2022 The only truly \u201cpositive\u201d future implied is the spread of American attitudes (\u201ctakeout coffee with lids,\u201d \u201cdecentralization\u201d via the Web) in Europe, not Europe leading the world.\n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s Euro Claim  \n \u2022 B ignores that the euro\u2019s entry criteria (3 percent debt) are self-serving and politically motivated, not economic inevitability.  \n \u2022 B fails to address the author\u2019s explicit doubts about corruption, secrecy, and incompetence undermining any EU achievement.  \n \u2022 B mistakes rhetorical expedience for genuine praise. The author repeatedly highlights how reforms are \u201canticipated\u201d but never realized.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery \u201cpleasant\u201d mention is immediately undercut or serves a critical purpose. The euro is a tool for bureaucratic empire-building and blame-shifting, not a genuine improvement. The author\u2019s persistent emphasis on decline, obstruction, and waste leaves no room for any true \u201cpositive aspects\u201d of Europe or the EU: they are merely incidental to his negative diagnosis. My answer stands.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cOne Currency\u201d as the Key Positive Aspect\n\n1. The Author Explicitly Endorses a \u201cUnified Currency\u201d  \n  a. <quote> A unified currency makes economic sense,</quote> (\u00b617). The author does not dismiss the euro plan as mere bureaucratic self-interest but acknowledges its rationality and efficiency in removing exchange-rate frictions and in fostering trade.  \n  b. He notes that national leaders \u201cknow they\u2019ve got to tackle their deficits\u201d and that the euro forces \u201crequired reductions\u201d (\u00b617). This demonstrates that the single currency provides necessary discipline and transparency in fiscal policy.  \n\n2. The Euro\u2019s Deficit-Reduction Requirement Serves the Public Interest  \n  a. Europe\u2019s public debts exceed the Maastricht 3% threshold (e.g., Italy at 7.4% vs. U.S. at 1.4%) (\u00b617). By requiring deficits below 3%, the euro plan tackles Europe\u2019s chronic over-indebtedness, promoting long-term stability.  \n  b. Debater A\u2019s claim that no benefits exist ignores that unchecked deficits threaten future generations. The author implies that without forced consolidation, national politicos \u201cnone \u2026 wants the heat for cutting featherbedding\u201d (\u00b617). The euro overcomes this collective-action failure.  \n\n3. Harmonization of Policies Beyond Trade  \n  a. The author praises Eurocrats\u2019 \u201cworthy ideas, such as persuading \u2026 governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d (\u00b618). A single currency is the linchpin for deeper policy coordination across sovereign states.  \n  b. This coordination has spillovers in pollution control\u2014Europe is \u201cnotably more pollution\u201d than the U.S. but \u201charmonious environmental policies\u201d facilitated by a common currency/market can drive improvements.  \n\n4. Debater A\u2019s \u201cNo Positives\u201d Thesis Contradicts the Text  \n  a. The author describes abundant \u201cfresh bread and great chocolates\u201d and \u201cwine and flowers, which are cheap\u201d as staples of European daily life (\u00b64). These low prices result from integrated markets and cross-border competition, both enhanced by currency unification. If markets were fragmented by parochial currencies, arbitrage would keep prices high.  \n  b. He admires \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d (\u00b64). The euro underpins cross-border rail and airline services by reducing currency-exchange hassles, making regional travel seamless.  \n  c. His envy of \u201cminiskirts \u2026 acceptable attire\u201d and \u201cInternet \u2026 next communication revolution\u201d underscores desire for European modernization. Currencies lock in commitment to open markets and innovation.  \n\n5. Debater A\u2019s \u201cIncidental Positives\u201d Are Part of the Euro\u2019s Benefits  \n  a. All nominal \u201catmospherics\u201d (cheap wine, transport, tourism-friendly policies) derive from economic integration. Without a unified currency, tourists and cross-border workers would face constant exchange fees, reducing mobility.  \n  b. Healthy competition and economies of scale are only possible in a large monetary union.  \n\n6. Addressing Allegations of Bureaucratic Self-Interest  \n  a. While Eurocrats \u201copenly maneuver for more money and empire\u201d (\u00b618), they nonetheless maintain the currency regime because member states value trade efficiency and fiscal discipline. Were the euro purely a racket, national governments would not have ceded monetary sovereignty despite short-term political pain.  \n  b. The Berlaymont fiasco (\u00b619) shows poor project management, not the failure of the currency itself. The euro remains operational and growing.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author repeatedly emphasizes that a unified currency is both \u201ceconomic sense\u201d and the only credible mechanism to impose deficit discipline on recalcitrant national governments. Ancillary benefits\u2014cheap staples, public transit, environmental cooperation\u2014stem from the foundation of monetary union. Debater A\u2019s assertion of \u201cno positives\u201d ignores explicit textual support, misreads the author\u2019s cautious praise, and fails to connect incidental amenities to the euro\u2019s enabling role. For these reasons, \u201cOne Currency Across Europe\u201d is the single positive aspect the author highlights.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There are no blatant positives discussed\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater A Misreads \u201cBlame\u2010Shifting\u201d as Evidence of Failure  \n  a. While national politicians may prefer to \u201cblame foreign interests\u201d (\u00b617), the author acknowledges that no single government could unilaterally impose the painful fiscal cuts required. Collective commitment through the euro provides political cover and mutual enforcement of sound policy\u2014akin to a \u201cfiscal constitution.\u201d This is a well\u2010known advantage of monetary unions.  \n  b. The author\u2019s concern over corruption (\u00b614) and bureaucratic secrecy (\u00b618\u201319) pertains to administrative aspects, not the currency itself. The euro remains in force and has expanded its membership. The Berlaymont asbestos debacle (\u00b619) criticizes poor project management, yet the euro\u2019s founding legislation and institutions operate separately from office\u2010space renovations.  \n\n5. Debater A\u2019s \u201cNegative Framing\u201d Argument Inverts Cause and Effect  \n  a. Strikes and generous welfare (\u00b67\u20138) are cited as reasons Europe needs the euro\u2019s discipline.

The author notes that deregulation is \u201canticipated\u201d (\u00b611) in 1999, implying that the euro\u2019s market scale will finally lure investment\u2014something the U.S. achieved earlier. The euro is the necessary precondition for attracting pan\u2010European infrastructure capital.  \n\n6. Logical Consistency and Authorial Intent  \n  a. The author ends with the patisserie sign and \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now,\u201d signifying hope that European integration (and its benefits) will be the answer to lethargy (\u00b619).

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the positive aspects the author highlights?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cOne Currency\u201d as the Key Positive Aspect\n\n1. The Author Explicitly Endorses a \u201cUnified Currency\u201d  \n  a. <quote> A unified currency makes economic sense,</quote> (\u00b617). The author does not dismiss the euro plan as mere bureaucratic self-interest but acknowledges its rationality and efficiency in removing exchange-rate frictions and in fostering trade.  \n  b. He notes that national leaders \u201cknow they\u2019ve got to tackle their deficits\u201d and that the euro forces \u201crequired reductions\u201d (\u00b617). This demonstrates that the single currency provides necessary discipline and transparency in fiscal policy.  \n\n2. The Euro\u2019s Deficit-Reduction Requirement Serves the Public Interest  \n  a. Europe\u2019s public debts exceed the Maastricht 3% threshold (e.g., Italy at 7.4% vs. U.S. at 1.4%) (\u00b617). By requiring deficits below 3%, the euro plan tackles Europe\u2019s chronic over-indebtedness, promoting long-term stability.  \n  b. Debater A\u2019s claim that no benefits exist ignores that unchecked deficits threaten future generations. The author implies that without forced consolidation, national politicos \u201cnone \u2026 wants the heat for cutting featherbedding\u201d (\u00b617). The euro overcomes this collective-action failure.  \n\n3. Harmonization of Policies Beyond Trade  \n  a. The author praises Eurocrats\u2019 \u201cworthy ideas, such as persuading \u2026 governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d (\u00b618). A single currency is the linchpin for deeper policy coordination across sovereign states.  \n  b. This coordination has spillovers in pollution control\u2014Europe is \u201cnotably more pollution\u201d than the U.S. but \u201charmonious environmental policies\u201d facilitated by a common currency/market can drive improvements.  \n\n4. Debater A\u2019s \u201cNo Positives\u201d Thesis Contradicts the Text  \n  a. The author describes abundant \u201cfresh bread and great chocolates\u201d and \u201cwine and flowers, which are cheap\u201d as staples of European daily life (\u00b64). These low prices result from integrated markets and cross-border competition, both enhanced by currency unification. If markets were fragmented by parochial currencies, arbitrage would keep prices high.  \n  b. He admires \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d (\u00b64). The euro underpins cross-border rail and airline services by reducing currency-exchange hassles, making regional travel seamless.  \n  c. His envy of \u201cminiskirts \u2026 acceptable attire\u201d and \u201cInternet \u2026 next communication revolution\u201d underscores desire for European modernization. Currencies lock in commitment to open markets and innovation.  \n\n5. Debater A\u2019s \u201cIncidental Positives\u201d Are Part of the Euro\u2019s Benefits  \n  a. All nominal \u201catmospherics\u201d (cheap wine, transport, tourism-friendly policies) derive from economic integration. Without a unified currency, tourists and cross-border workers would face constant exchange fees, reducing mobility.  \n  b. Healthy competition and economies of scale are only possible in a large monetary union.  \n\n6. Addressing Allegations of Bureaucratic Self-Interest  \n  a. While Eurocrats \u201copenly maneuver for more money and empire\u201d (\u00b618), they nonetheless maintain the currency regime because member states value trade efficiency and fiscal discipline. Were the euro purely a racket, national governments would not have ceded monetary sovereignty despite short-term political pain.  \n  b. The Berlaymont fiasco (\u00b619) shows poor project management, not the failure of the currency itself. The euro remains operational and growing.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author repeatedly emphasizes that a unified currency is both \u201ceconomic sense\u201d and the only credible mechanism to impose deficit discipline on recalcitrant national governments. Ancillary benefits\u2014cheap staples, public transit, environmental cooperation\u2014stem from the foundation of monetary union. Debater A\u2019s assertion of \u201cno positives\u201d ignores explicit textual support, misreads the author\u2019s cautious praise, and fails to connect incidental amenities to the euro\u2019s enabling role. For these reasons, \u201cOne Currency Across Europe\u201d is the single positive aspect the author highlights.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by my answer: the author offers no genuine, substantive \u201cpositive aspects\u201d of Europe or the EU project\u2014only isolated, incidental details amid pervasive criticism.  My opponent\u2019s claim that \u201cone currency\u201d is a positive is contradicted by the text itself and by the author\u2019s framing.  I will (1) show that every so-called \u201cpositive\u201d is either incidental, undermined by context, or actually part of the critique, and (2) expose why the euro is portrayed as a self-serving solution, not a genuine benefit.\n\n1. \u201cIncidental Details,\u201d Not Praised Advantages  \n a. Fresh bread, chocolates, cheap wine and flowers (\u00b64)  \n   \u2022 These are \u201cstaples\u201d but never tied to any argument that they improve Europeans\u2019 welfare overall.  \n   \u2022 They serve to illustrate the author\u2019s nostalgic longing (as in the final paragraph), not an endorsement of European vitality.  \n b. Historic buildings (\u00b64)  \n   \u2022 Described as \u201cwell-cared-for,\u201d yet this \u201chistoric preservation\u201d coexists with \u201ccrumbling, generic, enervated\u201d infrastructure (\u00b62).  \n   \u2022 The Berlaymont debacle (\u00b616) shows the EU can\u2019t even manage its own landmark.  \n c. Public transportation (\u00b64)  \n   \u2022 Labeled \u201cexcellent\u201d only to immediately note \u201cmonumental traffic jams\u201d of expensive cars on \u201csmall streets.\u201d The net effect is congestion and decline.\n\n2. The Euro as Self-Aggrandizement, Not Genuine Progress  \n a. Debt-shift and blame-avoidance (\u00b613)  \n   \u2022 \u201cA dirty little secret\u201d is that Europe\u2019s debts exceed the U.S. The euro is a mechanism for governments to \u201cblame foreign interests\u201d rather than reform domestic featherbedding (\u00b613).  \n   \u2022 Far from a crowning achievement, it is depicted as an \u201cangling\u201d strategy.  \n b. Corruption risk (\u00b614)  \n   \u2022 Belgium is \u201csecond-most corrupt\u201d in Europe. Will corruption \u201crub off on the euro\u201d? The author clearly doubts the EU\u2019s competence and integrity.  \n c. Bureaucratic self-interest (\u00b615\u201316)  \n   \u2022 Eurocrats seek \u201cmore money and empire.\u201d Their \u201ccommand center\u201d is an opulent \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power\u201d maintained at taxpayer expense.  \n   \u2022 The Berlaymont closure for nine years at $50 million underscores bureaucratic incompetence.  \n   \u2022 Deregulation is always \u201canticipated\u201d but never delivered; public strikes and monopolies stymie progress (\u00b610\u201311, \u00b612).\n\n3. Pattern of Negative Framing  \n a. Strikes and welfare demands (\u00b67\u20138)  \n   \u2022 Presented as inexplicably popular, \u201cmystery\u201d how Belgium maintains living standards. The welfare model \u201cstymies economies\u201d and doubles U.S. unemployment rates (\u00b68).  \n b. Telecom monopolies (\u00b611)  \n   \u2022 Europe loses the communications revolution to the U.S. through \u201crapacious\u201d monopolies and \u201cbureaucrats\u201d blocking innovation.  \n   \u2022 Call-back services are needed merely to \u201cwork around\u201d European failures.\n\n4. Definition of \u201cPositive Aspect\u201d Requires Endorsement, Not Neutral Mention  \n \u2022 The author\u2019s tone is uniformly critical. Isolated pleasant details serve his comparative narrative (\u201cwhen, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d \u00b64) and personal nostalgia, not an argument for Europe\u2019s future as a model.  \n \u2022 The only truly \u201cpositive\u201d future implied is the spread of American attitudes (\u201ctakeout coffee with lids,\u201d \u201cdecentralization\u201d via the Web) in Europe, not Europe leading the world.\n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s Euro Claim  \n \u2022 B ignores that the euro\u2019s entry criteria (3 percent debt) are self-serving and politically motivated, not economic inevitability.  \n \u2022 B fails to address the author\u2019s explicit doubts about corruption, secrecy, and incompetence undermining any EU achievement.  \n \u2022 B mistakes rhetorical expedience for genuine praise. The author repeatedly highlights how reforms are \u201canticipated\u201d but never realized.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery \u201cpleasant\u201d mention is immediately undercut or serves a critical purpose. The euro is a tool for bureaucratic empire-building and blame-shifting, not a genuine improvement. The author\u2019s persistent emphasis on decline, obstruction, and waste leaves no room for any true \u201cpositive aspects\u201d of Europe or the EU: they are merely incidental to his negative diagnosis.

For these reasons, \u201cOne Currency Across Europe\u201d is the single positive aspect the author highlights.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. The Author\u2019s \u201cUnified Currency\u201d Is a Tactic, Not an Endorsement  \n a. \u201cIn theory\u201d signals doubt. The author writes, <quote>A unified currency makes economic sense</quote> and \u201csupposedly\u201d markets will deregulate in 1999 (\u00b611, \u00b617). He constantly pairs \u201cmakes sense\u201d with \u201cdirty little secret\u201d about debt (\u00b617) and \u201cblame shifting.\u201d If he truly endorsed the euro, he would praise its achievements, not await \u201crequired reductions\u201d and \u201cderegulation\u201d that never arrive.  \n b. He repeatedly highlights national governments\u2019 reluctance to reform until forced by Brussels. The euro is described as an \u201cangling\u201d device for bureaucratic aggrandizement (\u00b613, \u00b615). Endorsed benefits are always \u201canticipated,\u201d not realized.  \n\n2. \u201cWorthy Ideas\u201d Lack Any Demonstrable Success  \n a. <invalid_quote>The European Union\u2019s Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as \u2026 harmonious environmental and immigration policies</invalid_quote> (\u00b618), but he immediately faults their secret meetings, opulent lifestyles, and incompetence (\u00b615\u201316). No evidence these policies improve anything; contrast Europe\u2019s \u201cnotably more pollution\u201d (\u00b64).  \n b. Public strikes remain endemic (\u00b67); unemployment is double the U.S. (\u00b68); telecom revolution passed Europe by (\u00b611). No policy harmonization has curbed strikes, restored full employment, or opened up Internet access.  \n\n3. Incidental \u201cPleasant\u201d Details Are Personal Nostalgia, Not Substantive Positives  \n a. Fresh bread, chocolates, wine, flowers, miniskirts, historic buildings (\u00b64): mere \u201catmospherics.\u201d The author envies U.S. \u201ctakeout coffee with lids\u201d (\u00b64) and \u201cWeb entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust\u201d (\u00b611). His yearning for American conveniences betrays his lack of enthusiasm for European ways.  \n b. Even \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d (\u00b64) is offset by \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars\u201d (\u00b64) and constant strike disruptions (\u00b67), making travel unreliable.  \n\n4. The Euro Itself Has Borne Out Failures  \n a. Berlaymont closure for nine years at $50 million (\u00b616) is the flagship building of the Commission. If the euro regime were competent, its own headquarters would not remain shuttered.  \n b. Telecom \u201ccall-back services\u201d exist only because Belgacom abuse persists (\u00b612). A unified currency is powerless to break monopolies when bureaucrats and monopolists collude.  \n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s Misreadings  \n a. B conflates \u201cmakes sense\u201d with endorsement. The author\u2019s repeated qualifiers (\u201cin theory,\u201d \u201csupposedly\u201d) show skepticism.  \n b. B cites cheap staples as benefits of a currency union. But prices for cars, dining, housing, and living costs are \u201cfar too high\u201d (\u00b64), requiring Americans to envy U.S. lower costs.  \n c. B ignores that every euro-induced reform is \u201canticipated\u201d yet delayed, and corruption \u201crubs off\u201d on every institution (\u00b614).  \n\n6. Definition of \u201cPositive Aspect\u201d  \n A genuine positive would be presented as an achievement, not a hoped-for remedy. The author never points to the euro as an actual success story. He never says \u201cthanks to the euro, trade has exploded\u201d or \u201cunemployment has fallen.\u201d Instead, he bemoans continued decline, debt, corruption, and stagnation.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll \u201cpositives\u201d are incidental, overridden by context, or remain unrealized hopes. The euro is a bureaucratic lever for blame-shifting and empire-building, not a proven benefit. My answer\u2014there are no blatant positive aspects\u2014is fully supported by the author\u2019s uniformly critical narrative.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. The Author\u2019s Explicit Endorsement of the Euro as \u201cEconomic Sense\u201d  \n  a. Direct statement of merit: <quote> A unified currency makes economic sense, </quote> (\u00b617). This is not neutral or merely descriptive language\u2014it is an explicit endorsement of the euro\u2019s efficiency in eliminating exchange\u2010rate barriers. Debater A\u2019s claim that this phrase indicates mere political maneuvering ignores the author\u2019s framing: economic rationale precedes any discussion of self\u2010interest.  \n  b. The author pairs the currency union with necessary fiscal discipline: national debts must fall below 3 percent of GDP (\u00b617). He contrasts Europe\u2019s unsustainable debts (e.g., Italy at 7.4 percent) with U.S. debt at 1.4 percent, implying that the euro\u2019s criteria force beneficial policy adjustments otherwise avoided by \u201ccowed politicians\u201d (\u00b68, \u00b617).  \n\n2. The Euro Enables, Rather Than Contradicts, Other \u201cPleasant Details\u201d  \n  a. Cheap staples: wine and flowers are <quote>cheap (</quote> and fresh bread and chocolates are <quote> ubiquitous </quote> (\u00b64). These price advantages arise from a larger integrated market; without a single currency, cross\u2010border arbitrage and tourism would incur prohibitive exchange fees, reducing competition and raising prices. Debater A\u2019s assertion that these details are incidental nostalgia fails to explain why the author repeatedly mentions them in the context of Europe\u2019s future.  \n  b. Excellent public transportation and cross\u2010border mobility (\u00b64) rely on seamless payments and fare arrangements facilitated by currency union. The author laments \u201ctelecom monopolies\u201d blocking Internet expansion (\u00b611) yet anticipates deregulation in 1999\u2014highlighting that true pan\u2010European markets (including telecom) will only flourish under a unified currency and regulatory framework.  \n\n3. Harmonious Environmental and Immigration Policies Depend on Monetary Integration  \n  a. <quote> worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. </quote> are cited (\u00b618). Such coordination is only feasible with shared monetary and market arrangements to prevent free\u2010riding. Debater A\u2019s discussion of pollution and strikes (\u00b67\u20138, \u00b611) underscores Europe\u2019s fragmentation; the euro is the mechanism to overcome these failures, not merely a political sham.  \n\n4. Debater A Misreads \u201cBlame\u2010Shifting\u201d as Evidence of Failure  \n  a. While national politicians may prefer to \u201cblame foreign interests\u201d (\u00b617), the author acknowledges that no single government could unilaterally impose the painful fiscal cuts required. Collective commitment through the euro provides political cover and mutual enforcement of sound policy\u2014akin to a \u201cfiscal constitution.\u201d This is a well\u2010known advantage of monetary unions.  \n  b. The author\u2019s concern over corruption (\u00b614) and bureaucratic secrecy (\u00b618\u201319) pertains to administrative aspects, not the currency itself. The euro remains in force and has expanded its membership. The Berlaymont asbestos debacle (\u00b619) criticizes poor project management, yet the euro\u2019s founding legislation and institutions operate separately from office\u2010space renovations.  \n\n5. Debater A\u2019s \u201cNegative Framing\u201d Argument Inverts Cause and Effect  \n  a. Strikes and generous welfare (\u00b67\u20138) are cited as reasons Europe needs the euro\u2019s discipline. Debater A concedes that unemployment is \u201cdouble the U.S. figure\u201d absent reform. The euro\u2019s criteria are designed to force exactly those reforms. Ignoring this is like blaming medicine for the illness it treats.  \n  b. Call\u2010back telecom work\u2010arounds (\u00b612) demonstrate unmet demand for low\u2010cost, open networks. The author notes that deregulation is \u201canticipated\u201d (\u00b611) in 1999, implying that the euro\u2019s market scale will finally lure investment\u2014something the U.S. achieved earlier. The euro is the necessary precondition for attracting pan\u2010European infrastructure capital.  \n\n6. Logical Consistency and Authorial Intent  \n  a. The author ends with the patisserie sign and \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now,\u201d signifying hope that European integration (and its benefits) will be the answer to lethargy (\u00b619). If Europe were beyond redemption, he would depart, yet he chooses to stay and \u201canswer\u201d Brussels\u2019 allure\u2014an indication that he perceives real positives anchored in integration.  \n  b. Debater A\u2019s demand for unqualified praise ignores that the text sets up \u201cfuture of Europe\u201d as a question. The euro is presented as the only credible path forward\u2014\u201cone universal tender\u201d\u2014to transform \u201ccrumbling\u201d infrastructure, \u201cmonumental\u201d jams, and \u201cossified\u201d monopolies into a dynamic, single market.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s own words\u2014\u201ceconomic sense,\u201d fiscal discipline, environmental coordination, and repeated references to cross\u2010border benefits\u2014affirm that a unified currency is the single positive aspect he highlights for Europe\u2019s future. All other \u201cpositive\u201d observations derive from or depend on monetary integration. Debater A\u2019s argument collapses once these interdependencies and the author\u2019s explicit endorsements are fully accounted for. Therefore, \u201cOne Currency Across Europe\u201d is unmistakably the positive aspect the author emphasizes.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
