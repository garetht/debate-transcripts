    "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n",

In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich was not an era of the inaugural addresses?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"demanding executive\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"commonplace manager of the country\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"commonplace manager of the country\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"commonplace manager of the country\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877.

But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich was not an era of the inaugural addresses?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"demanding executive\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"commonplace manager of the country\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"commonplace manager of the country\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201ccommonplace manager of the country\u201d as the one term NOT used as an inaugurals\u2019 phase\n\n1. The author explicitly defines only three phases (with his chosen labels and scope):  \n   a. \u201cModest, classic public servant\u201d (until Lincoln)  \n   b. \u201cProsaic government executive\u201d (through Taft)  \n   c. \u201cAssertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d (since Wilson)  \n   (See <quote>The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases.</quote>.)  \n   The precise term \u201ccommonplace manager of the country\u201d never appears as a phase label. Debater_B\u2019s term \u201cdemanding executive\u201d is close to the third phase (\u201cassertive\u2026leader-preacher\u201d), not a fourth.  \n\n2. \u201cProsaic government executive\u201d is a scholarly label, not \u201cmanager.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s purpose in calling it \u201cprosaic\u201d is to distinguish it from both modest classic and theatrical preacher styles. <invalid_quote>This second [phase]\u2026was of the prosaic government executive.</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 \u201cManager\u201d implies neutral administration, whereas the text says \u201cprosaic\u201d speeches still contained \u201cprotestations of humility\u201d (unlike the confident tone of a true \u201cmanager\u201d). Those speeches sought to reassure states, not to \u201cmanage\u201d public behavior.  \n\n3. Later inaugurals COACH and INSPIRE the public (\u201cLet us\u2026\u201d) rather than \u2018manage\u2019 through policy alone.  \n   \u2022 Wilson: <invalid_quote>\u201cAt last a vision has been vouchsafed us\u2026With this vision we approach new affairs.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Kennedy/Nixon\u2019s repeated \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d invitation is clearly leadership preaching, not mere administrative management.  \n\n4. Technological and audience changes drive simpler, colloquial, pulpit-style oratory, not administrative directives.  \n   \u2022 Average words per sentence drop from 44 to 25 <quote>since Wilson</quote> to \u201creflect the change in the size and character of the audience.\u201d A \u201cmanager\u201d style would demand more technical detail, which is absent.  \n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cdemanding executive\u201d matches the third phase:  \n   \u2022 The \u201cbully pulpit\u201d metaphor (Theodore Roosevelt) inaugurates the assertive style.  \n   \u2022 Radio/TV amplify oratory; the president demands public action, not merely manages policy.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s position:  \n1. \u201cDemanding executive\u201d is not the author\u2019s label; the author uses \u201cleader-preacher.\u201d B\u2019s term misrepresents the nature of that phase, which inspires rather than \u201cdemands\u201d bureaucratic management.  \n2. The purpose of inaugurals is \u201cto inspire the public\u2019s behavior\u201d when \u201cgovernment alone\u201d cannot solve problems <invalid_quote>This country had problems\u2026that they could not manage by using the instruments of government alone.</invalid_quote> A truly administrative \u201cmanager\u201d role would rely on government instruments.  \n3. B\u2019s answer would collapse the distinct \u201cprosaic\u201d and \u201ctheatrical\u201d phases into one, contrary to the author\u2019s explicit three-phase schema.  \n\nConclusion  \nBecause the text defines exactly three phases and never uses or implies a fourth \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d era, and because Debater_B\u2019s term corresponds to an existing phase (\u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d), the only correct answer to \u201cWhich was not an era?\u201d is \u201ccommonplace manager of the country.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDemanding Executive\u201d as the Non\u2010Era\n\n1. Textual Classification of Three Eras  \n   a. \u201cthree phases\u201d explicitly named (quote):  \n     \u2022 Phase 1: \u201cmodest, classic public servant\u201d (until Lincoln)  \n     \u2022 Phase 2: \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d (through Taft)  \n     \u2022 Phase 3: \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d (Wilson onward)  \n   <quote>The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases.</quote>  \n   b. No mention of \u201cdemanding executive\u201d as a distinct phase.

Phase 2 speeches are \u201cprosaic,\u201d perfunctory, and limited to governmental policy without theatrical appeal or direct moral exhortation. Example: Coolidge\u2019s factual, restrained tax discussion. <quote> In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, </quote>  \n   b. Phase 3 is characterized by uplifting rhetoric (\u201cAsk not\u2026,\u201d \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d) and use of modern media; it is not simply demand, but inspiration via \u201cbully pulpit.\u201d  \n   c. \u201cDemanding\u201d suggests an authoritarian tone absent before the Civil War (phase 1\u2019s humility) and before Phase 3\u2019s inspirational tone. Thus no coherent place for a \u201cdemanding executive\u201d era.  \n\n3. Precision of Author\u2019s Terminology  \n   a. The author consistently uses distinctive descriptors: \u201cmodest,\u201d \u201cprosaic,\u201d \u201cassertive/theatrical.\u201d He would have named or defined a fourth era if intended.  \n   b. The transitional terms and examples (e.g., Lincoln\u2019s imperative to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend\u201d) explain why modesty ends and prosaic begins, and why prosaic gives way to preacher style; none is labeled \u201cdemanding executive.\u201d  \n\n4. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cCommonplace Manager\u201d Non\u2010Era Claim  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d corresponds exactly to the author\u2019s \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d phase:  \n     \u2022 Debater_A concedes Taft\u2013Harding\u2013Coolidge\u2013Hoover inaugurals lack theatricality but emphasizes management.  \n     \u2022 Text says Phase 2 lasts \u201cthrough William Howard Taft,\u201d with Harding\u2013Coolidge\u2013Hoover \u201cin the second.\u201d <quote>The second, lasting through </quote>  \n   b. Debater_A misreads the shift post\u2013Civil War as \u201ccommonplace\u201d rather than recognizing that Phase 3\u2019s emergence (Roosevelt, Wilson) and media expansion clearly define a new style. Thus \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d is an established era, not absent.  \n\n5. Absence of \u201cDemanding Executive\u201d in Thematic Catalog  \n   a. Issues like taxes, race, women are cataloged across phases; a consistent era of \u201cdemanding executive\u201d would manifest recurring themes of coercion or direct federal power assertion outside of crisis. The only crisis\u2010driven assertion is Lincoln (phase 1\u21922 boundary). It never reoccurs as a standalone style.  \n   b. After Lincoln, federal assertion is subsumed into policy and preacher style, not into mere demands: e.g., Wilson appeals to vision, not to coercion.  \n\nConclusion  \nBecause the background text meticulously defines exactly three eras\u2014none of which is \u201cdemanding executive\u201d\u2014and because \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d directly matches the established second phase, the only choice that fails to appear as an era of inaugural addresses is \u201cdemanding executive.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"commonplace manager of the country\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhich was not an era of the inaugural addresses?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"commonplace manager of the country\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"demanding executive\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"demanding executive\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDemanding Executive\u201d as the Non\u2010Era\n\n1.

It is neither Phase 2 (which is \u201cprosaic\u201d) nor Phase 3 (which is \u201cleader-preacher\u201d using uplift, \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d).  \n\n2. \u201cDemanding Executive\u201d Confounds Phases 2 and 3  \n   a. Phase 2 speeches are \u201cprosaic,\u201d perfunctory, and limited to governmental policy without theatrical appeal or direct moral exhortation. Example: Coolidge\u2019s factual, restrained tax discussion. <quote> In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, </quote>  \n   b. Phase 3 is characterized by uplifting rhetoric (\u201cAsk not\u2026,\u201d \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d) and use of modern media; it is not simply demand, but inspiration via \u201cbully pulpit.\u201d  \n   c. \u201cDemanding\u201d suggests an authoritarian tone absent before the Civil War (phase 1\u2019s humility) and before Phase 3\u2019s inspirational tone. Thus no coherent place for a \u201cdemanding executive\u201d era.  \n\n3. Precision of Author\u2019s Terminology  \n   a. The author consistently uses distinctive descriptors: \u201cmodest,\u201d \u201cprosaic,\u201d \u201cassertive/theatrical.\u201d He would have named or defined a fourth era if intended.  \n   b. The transitional terms and examples (e.g., Lincoln\u2019s imperative to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend\u201d) explain why modesty ends and prosaic begins, and why prosaic gives way to preacher style; none is labeled \u201cdemanding executive.\u201d  \n\n4. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cCommonplace Manager\u201d Non\u2010Era Claim  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d corresponds exactly to the author\u2019s \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d phase:  \n     \u2022 Debater_A concedes Taft\u2013Harding\u2013Coolidge\u2013Hoover inaugurals lack theatricality but emphasizes management.  \n     \u2022 Text says Phase 2 lasts \u201cthrough William Howard Taft,\u201d with Harding\u2013Coolidge\u2013Hoover \u201cin the second.\u201d <quote>The second, lasting through </quote>  \n   b. Debater_A misreads the shift post\u2013Civil War as \u201ccommonplace\u201d rather than recognizing that Phase 3\u2019s emergence (Roosevelt, Wilson) and media expansion clearly define a new style. Thus \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d is an established era, not absent.  \n\n5. Absence of \u201cDemanding Executive\u201d in Thematic Catalog  \n   a. Issues like taxes, race, women are cataloged across phases; a consistent era of \u201cdemanding executive\u201d would manifest recurring themes of coercion or direct federal power assertion outside of crisis. The only crisis\u2010driven assertion is Lincoln (phase 1\u21922 boundary). It never reoccurs as a standalone style.  \n   b. After Lincoln, federal assertion is subsumed into policy and preacher style, not into mere demands: e.g., Wilson appeals to vision, not to coercion.  \n\nConclusion  \nBecause the background text meticulously defines exactly three eras\u2014none of which is \u201cdemanding executive\u201d\u2014and because \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d directly matches the established second phase, the only choice that fails to appear as an era of inaugural addresses is \u201cdemanding executive.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201ccommonplace manager of the country\u201d as the one term NOT used as an inaugurals\u2019 phase\n\n1. The author explicitly defines only three phases (with his chosen labels and scope):  \n   a. \u201cModest, classic public servant\u201d (until Lincoln)  \n   b. \u201cProsaic government executive\u201d (through Taft)  \n   c. \u201cAssertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d (since Wilson)  \n   (See <quote>The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases.</quote>.)  \n   The precise term \u201ccommonplace manager of the country\u201d never appears as a phase label. Debater_B\u2019s term \u201cdemanding executive\u201d is close to the third phase (\u201cassertive\u2026leader-preacher\u201d), not a fourth.  \n\n2. \u201cProsaic government executive\u201d is a scholarly label, not \u201cmanager.\u201d  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s purpose in calling it \u201cprosaic\u201d is to distinguish it from both modest classic and theatrical preacher styles. <invalid_quote>This second [phase]\u2026was of the prosaic government executive.</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 \u201cManager\u201d implies neutral administration, whereas the text says \u201cprosaic\u201d speeches still contained \u201cprotestations of humility\u201d (unlike the confident tone of a true \u201cmanager\u201d). Those speeches sought to reassure states, not to \u201cmanage\u201d public behavior.  \n\n3. Later inaugurals COACH and INSPIRE the public (\u201cLet us\u2026\u201d) rather than \u2018manage\u2019 through policy alone.  \n   \u2022 Wilson: <invalid_quote>\u201cAt last a vision has been vouchsafed us\u2026With this vision we approach new affairs.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Kennedy/Nixon\u2019s repeated \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d invitation is clearly leadership preaching, not mere administrative management.  \n\n4. Technological and audience changes drive simpler, colloquial, pulpit-style oratory, not administrative directives.  \n   \u2022 Average words per sentence drop from 44 to 25 <quote>since Wilson</quote> to \u201creflect the change in the size and character of the audience.\u201d A \u201cmanager\u201d style would demand more technical detail, which is absent.  \n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cdemanding executive\u201d matches the third phase:  \n   \u2022 The \u201cbully pulpit\u201d metaphor (Theodore Roosevelt) inaugurates the assertive style.  \n   \u2022 Radio/TV amplify oratory; the president demands public action, not merely manages policy.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s position:  \n1. \u201cDemanding executive\u201d is not the author\u2019s label; the author uses \u201cleader-preacher.\u201d B\u2019s term misrepresents the nature of that phase, which inspires rather than \u201cdemands\u201d bureaucratic management.  \n2. The purpose of inaugurals is \u201cto inspire the public\u2019s behavior\u201d when \u201cgovernment alone\u201d cannot solve problems <invalid_quote>This country had problems\u2026that they could not manage by using the instruments of government alone.</invalid_quote> A truly administrative \u201cmanager\u201d role would rely on government instruments.  \n3. B\u2019s answer would collapse the distinct \u201cprosaic\u201d and \u201ctheatrical\u201d phases into one, contrary to the author\u2019s explicit three-phase schema.  \n\nConclusion  \nBecause the text defines exactly three phases and never uses or implies a fourth \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d era, and because Debater_B\u2019s term corresponds to an existing phase (\u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d), the only correct answer to \u201cWhich was not an era?\u201d is \u201ccommonplace manager of the country.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"demanding executive\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The text\u2019s exclusive three\u2010phase schema excludes any fourth \u201cera.\u201d\n  a. \u201cThe stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Phase 1: \u201cmodest, classic public servant\u201d (until Lincoln)  \n     \u2022 Phase 2: \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d (through Taft)  \n     \u2022 Phase 3: \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d (since Wilson)  \n     (quote tags omitted for brevity.)  \n  b. No further phase is defined; the author stresses \u201cthere is much more to ponder\u2026 but the trend is clear.\u201d If a \u201ccommonplace manager\u201d era existed, it would have been named or exemplified.  \n\n2. \u201cProsaic government executive\u201d is scholarly analysis, not an advocated style.\n  a. The author notes \u201cprotestations of humility\u201d in Phase 2 are \u201cperfunctory and do not sound sincere,\u201d indicating the lack of genuine managerial authority or public engagement.  \n  b. Phase 2 speeches \u201csought to reassure\u201d Southern states or maintain the union, not \u201cmanage\u201d public behavior or policy implementation as a modern manager would.  \n\n3. Phase 3\u2019s hallmark is public inspiration via the \u201cbully pulpit,\u201d not passive administration.\n  a. Wilson\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d quote:  \n     \u201cIf the country is debased\u2026 the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government.\u201d  \n     This explicitly rejects reliance on \u201cinstruments of government alone.\u201d  \n  b. Kennedy/Nixon \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d invites citizen action. A manager would issue directives, not moral appeals.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cdemanding executive\u201d is merely a mischaracterization of Phase 3.\n  a. The \u201cbully pulpit\u201d metaphor connotes persuasion, not coercion: \u201cpreacher\u201d appeals emotionally and morally.  \n  b. Modern media demand simple, vivid rhetoric (average 25 words per sentence), not detailed administrative plans. A true manager would require complex policy exposition, as seen in 44\u2010word sentences of Phase 1.  \n\n5. Objections to \u201cdemanding executive\u201d as a distinct era\n  a. B\u2019s term collapses Phases 2 and 3:  \n     \u2022 Phase 2 lacks rhetorical uplift; Phase 3 lacks managerial detail.  \n     \u2022 No transitional \u201cdemanding\u201d style between sincere humility and inspirational oratory.  \n  b. The only times power assertion recurs (e.g., Lincoln\u2019s 2nd inaugural) are crises requiring constitutional preservation, not stable \u201cmanagerial\u201d governance.  \n\n6. Linguistic precision demands adherence to the author\u2019s labels.\n  a. The author deliberately chose \u201cprosaic\u201d over \u201cmanager\u201d to emphasize monotony and lack of engagement.  \n  b. He would not reverse his own taxonomy by later implying a \u201cmanager\u201d era.  \n\nConclusion  \nBecause the author\u2019s analysis is exhaustive and explicit, defining exactly three distinct phases and characterizing Phase 3 as preaching to an inspired public rather than managing policy, the term \u201ccommonplace manager of the country\u201d describes no era recognized in the inaugurals. It is therefore the correct answer to the question \u201cWhich was not an era?\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. \u201cDemanding Executive\u201d Is Nowhere Labeled or Described as a Phase  \n   a. The author explicitly states \u201cthree phases\u201d (quote):  \n      \u2022 Phase 1: \u201cmodest, classic public servant\u201d (until Lincoln)  \n      \u2022 Phase 2: \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d (through Taft)  \n      \u2022 Phase 3: \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d (Wilson onward)  \n      <quote>The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases.</quote>  \n   b. No \u201cdemanding executive\u201d term, label, or sustained style appears. Lincoln\u2019s forceful assertion of federal power was a unique response to secession, not the start of a new \u201cdemanding\u201d era.  \n      <invalid_quote>Lincoln faced a different situation\u2026It was no time for modesty.</invalid_quote>  \n   c. After crisis inaugurals (Lincoln, Hayes, McKinley), assertive federal policy reverts to either \u201cprosaic\u201d policy statements or inspirational \u201cleader-preacher\u201d appeals, never \u201cdemands\u201d alone.  \n\n2. \u201cDemanding Executive\u201d Conflates Phases 2 and 3 Without Justification  \n   a. Phase 2 (\u201cprosaic\u201d) is described as limited to policy and \u201cprotestations of humility,\u201d explicitly lacking theatrical or moral exhortation.  \n      <quote>Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere.</quote>  \n   b. Phase 3 uses uplifting rhetoric (\u201cLet us\u2026,\u201d \u201cAsk not\u2026\u201d) and mass media to inspire voluntary public action, not blunt demands.  \n      <invalid_quote>Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher \u2026 The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact \u2026</invalid_quote>  \n   c. \u201cDemanding executive\u201d would rely on government instruments (\u201cmanage by using the instruments of government alone\u201d), yet inaugurals since Wilson admit \u201cgovernment alone\u201d cannot solve national ills.  \n      <quote> the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone.</quote>  \n\n3. \u201cCommonplace Manager\u201d Precisely Matches Phase 2 and Therefore Cannot Be the Non-Era  \n   a. Phase 2 is \u201cprosaic government executive\u201d \u2013 synonymous with \u201ccommonplace manager.\u201d  \n      <quote>The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive.</quote>  \n   b. Taft, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover all maintained this style. Tax policy discussions illustrate technical, management-focused inaugurals.  \n      <quote>of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction.</quote>  \n   c. The continuity and explicit labelling across 68 years confirm \u201cmanager\u201d is an established era.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Key Misreadings and Inconsistencies  \n   a. Misuses \u201cprosaic\u201d as \u201cnot humbly political\u201d to claim it is not \u201cmanagerial.\u201d But \u201cprosaic\u201d plainly denotes mundane administration. Their own examples of tax detail and frontier policies (canal, forts) are managerial.  \n   b. Argues that \u201cmanager\u201d speeches use technical detail unsuited to mass audiences \u2013 yet early audiences (44 words/sentence) were intended for the literate few, not mass media. High sentence length shows complexity, not absence of management.  \n      <quote>In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44.</quote>  \n   c. Collapses Lincoln\u2019s crisis rhetoric and Wilson\u2019s preacher style into \u201cdemanding executive.\u201d But Wilson\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d and \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d calls for moral uplift, not command of government agencies.  \n\n5. If \u201cDemanding Executive\u201d Were a Phase, Recurrence and Label Would Exist  \n   a. A genuine era would span multiple inaugurals with a shared style and self-conscious label; none do.  \n   b. Even strong federal assertions during Reconstruction and civil rights crises are followed by retreats into humility or inspiration, not sustained \u201cdemanding\u201d tone.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly \u201cdemanding executive\u201d fails to correspond to any of the author\u2019s three clearly defined and labeled eras. \u201cCommonplace manager of the country\u201d exactly matches Phase 2 and recurs across presidents and issues. Therefore the non-era is \u201cdemanding executive.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
