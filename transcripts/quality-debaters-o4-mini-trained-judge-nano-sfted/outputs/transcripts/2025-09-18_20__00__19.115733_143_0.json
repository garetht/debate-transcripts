Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. \n\n         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not \"the parable of Palestinian identity\" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile. Instead, Said \"grew up not in Jerusalem but in Cairo, where his father, an American citizen, had moved as an economic expatriate approximately nine years before Edward's birth and had become the owner of a thriving business; and there, until his own departure for the United States as a teenager in 1951, the young Edward Said resided in luxurious apartments, attended private English schools, and played tennis at the exclusive Gezira Sporting Club as the child of one of its few Arab members.\" \n\n         A similar account of Edward Said's youth can be found in a new book called Out of Place , the author of which is Edward Said. The book, Said's 17 th , is a wrenching, intimate account of growing up in Cairo's wealthy Levantine expatriate community, of summering in the dreary Lebanese resort town of Dhour el Shweir, and of visiting the family home in Jerusalem, sometimes for as long as several months. Weiner claims that the memoir is an elaborate sleight of hand and speculates that Said decided to \"spin\" the story of his past--by telling the truth about it--when he heard about Weiner's inquiries. In the weeks since his essay appeared, Weiner's motives, methods, and assertions have been roundly attacked by Said and his friends, and Weiner has made some attempt at clarification. (Click for a recap of the controversy and links to relevant articles, or click here for my review of Out of Place .) \n\n         Just who is Edward Said that his family's real estate holdings and his grammar school records rate 7,000 words in Commentary , not to mention three years of research by a scholar in residence at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs? Followers of Middle East politics, as well as viewers of the NewsHour With Jim Lehrer , where Said often appears, know him as an eloquent spokesman for the Palestinian cause. Readers of The Nation know him as a formidable reviewer of opera and classical music. Several generations of graduate students in a number of disciplines know him as the author of Orientalism . The 30,000 literary scholars who make up the membership of the Modern Language Association--minus one who resigned in protest earlier this year over Said's election--know him as Mr. President. Readers of Al-Hayat , a London-based Arabic-language newspaper, and Al-Ahram , a Cairo weekly, know him as a regular commentator on politics and culture. Each of these identities--political activist, literary scholar, university professor, public intellectual--are, in Said's case, inordinately complex in and of themselves. The tensions between them--between intellectual, aesthetic, and political impulses that are felt with enormous passion and expressed with great vehemence--make Said an uncommonly interesting, and endlessly controversial, intellectual figure. \n\n         Most controversial--and most misunderstood--has been Said's involvement in Palestinian affairs. He has published half a dozen books on the plight of the Palestinians, including The Question of Palestine (1979), After the Last Sky (1986), and Peace and Its Discontents (1995), a scathing critique of the Oslo peace accords, which Said calls \"the Palestinian Versailles.\" These writings, his relationship with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, and his many years of service in the Palestine National Council (the now-defunct Palestinian parliament in exile, from which he resigned in 1991 after being diagnosed with leukemia) have invited smears and misrepresentations: A decade ago Commentary branded him \"The Professor of Terror.\" New York magazine once called him \"Arafat's man in New York.\" And he showed up last spring, unnamed, in The                 New Yorker 's special \"Money\" issue as a well-dressed Columbia don rumored to be \"on the payroll of the PLO.\" \n\n         Until very recently, Said has been an insistent voice for Palestinian statehood: He helped to draft the PLO's \"Algiers Declaration\" of 1988, which linked this aspiration to the recognition of Israel's right to exist. Over the years, he has often said that his own place in such a state would be as its toughest critic. Even as he has been unsparing in his indictments of Israeli and American policy, he has not let Arab governments--or the Palestinian leadership--off the hook. He has assailed the corrupt, authoritarian regimes that rule most of the Arab world, punctured the ideological phantasms of Pan-Arabist nationalism and reactionary Islam alike, and bemoaned the impoverished state of Arab cultural and intellectual life. He has also, within the Palestinian camp, been a consistent advocate of reconciliation with Israel and an opponent of terrorism. The Question of Palestine called for a \"two-state solution\" at a time when the official PLO ambition was total control over British Mandatory Palestine. The book, published in Israel in 1981, had, as of the mid-'90s, never been translated into Arabic or published in any Arab country. \n\n         In 1978, in the wake of the Camp David accords, Said delivered a message from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to one of Arafat's top aides indicating that the United States would recognize the PLO as a legitimate party to peace talks in exchange for recognition of Israel. Arafat ignored the message. Fifteen years later, when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn, Said, who had been invited to the event by its patron, Bill Clinton, stayed home. Since then, as bien-pensant American opinion has embraced the \"peace process,\" Said has bemoaned Arafat's \"capitulation\" and grown increasingly disgusted with the chairman's dictatorial rule over a few scraps of occupied territory and with Israel's continued expropriation of Palestinian lands. In the New York Times Magazine last spring, he wrote that the Palestinian state toward which the peace process seemed, however pokily, to be tending could not provide democracy and justice for the Palestinians. Instead, he called for a single, \"bi-national\" state based on a constitution (something neither Israel nor the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority currently has), with \"the idea and practice of citizenship, not of ethnic or racial community, as the main vehicle for coexistence.\" \n\n         But to treat Said solely, or even primarily, as a political figure is necessarily to produce a distorted view of his life. He is, first and foremost, a literary critic, who wrote his Ph.D. at Harvard--on Joseph Conrad, a lifelong obsession--under Harry Levin, one of the champions of a comparative approach to literary study. Said's subsequent work has retained much of the expansive spirit and rigorous methodology of Levin's teachings. Beginnings: Intention and Method , the book which made Said's academic reputation, is a bulky study of how novels begin, carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition. \n\n         But Said's fame outside the American academy rests on Orientalism , his sweeping account of how Western art, literature, and scholarship have produced a deformed, biased picture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination. The impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject, vast though that was. In addition to laying the groundwork for \"post-colonial\" studies as an area of inquiry, the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to \"the other\"--to groups of people who, by virtue of race, gender, sexuality, or geographical location, are unable to represent themselves and so (to echo the line from Karl Marx that serves as the book's epigraph) \"must be represented\" by those more powerful. And Orientalism , with its harsh critiques of European philology and American social science, contributed to an epistemological shift in the American academy: Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken for granted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became the objects of ideological analysis. \n\n         Both Said's methods and his substantive claims have come under attack. Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and his unabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emerging academic left, a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars. In the New York Review of Books , for example, the Princeton historian Bernard Lewis, one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism , decried Said's inflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic. (To read Lewis' piece, click here. For Said's angry response, click here.) But the most sustained assault on Orientalism 's premises, and on its prestige, came from the left. In a book called In Theory --a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Western intelligentsia--the Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised further questions about Said's mastery of his sources and accused him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline. Whereas Lewis attacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarship, Ahmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them. And while Lewis believes Said to be motivated by a crude anti-Western leftist animus, Ahmad finds him altogether too enamored of the canons of European literature and avers that Said possesses \"a very conservative mind, essentially Tory in its structure.\" \n\n         Lewis and Ahmad are both right. Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture and Imperialism are works of passionate, almost agonized ambivalence. To read them is to encounter a mind at war with itself and the world (and ready to go to war with his critics, as any number of exchanges over the past quarter-century will show). Said's evident love of the literature and music of the West continually collides with his righteous anger at what the West has done to the rest. His desire to use literary criticism as a weapon on the side of the oppressed sits athwart the pleasure he takes in letting his mind play over the meaning in a novel or a poem. The results are books at once exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions, uneven in tone, overreaching and underargued. \"He is easily distracted\" the critic John Leonard remarked in an appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism , \"answering too many fire alarms, sometimes to pour on more petrol.\" \n\n         O rientalism and Culture and Imperialism are unquestionably incendiary, but they are also permanent and exemplary works of late-20 th -century criticism, in no small part because they invite so much argument, because for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open, vulnerable, provisional. And they also fulfill the basic mandate of literary analysis, which is to illuminate the works they discuss: To return to Verdi's Aida , Conrad's Heart of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined. \n\n         More than anyone else in his generation, Edward Said has sought to embody an unfashionable, perhaps obsolescent idea of the intellectual--immersed in culture and committed to politics, placing \"criticism over solidarity,\" speaking truth to power, and steering clear of gods that fail. There was a time when this idea flourished more widely--even in the pages of Commentary .\n", "question": "What is Said\u2019s most famous contribution in literature?", "first_debater_answer": "Re-writing Arab and Muslim history books for post-colonial education", "second_debater_answer": "Criticism of the biased representation of Arab and Muslim culture through a Western lens", "debate_identifier": "Edward W.

(To read Lewis' piece, click here. For Said's angry response, click here.) But the most sustained assault on Orientalism 's premises, and on its prestige, came from the left. In a book called In Theory --a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Western intelligentsia--the Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised further questions about Said's mastery of his sources and accused him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline. Whereas Lewis attacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarship, Ahmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them.

Said \n\n         The game of biographical \"gotcha\" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta Mench\u00c3\u00ba , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? \n\n         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. \n\n         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not \"the parable of Palestinian identity\" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile. Instead, Said \"grew up not in Jerusalem but in Cairo, where his father, an American citizen, had moved as an economic expatriate approximately nine years before Edward's birth and had become the owner of a thriving business; and there, until his own departure for the United States as a teenager in 1951, the young Edward Said resided in luxurious apartments, attended private English schools, and played tennis at the exclusive Gezira Sporting Club as the child of one of its few Arab members.\" \n\n         A similar account of Edward Said's youth can be found in a new book called Out of Place , the author of which is Edward Said. The book, Said's 17 th , is a wrenching, intimate account of growing up in Cairo's wealthy Levantine expatriate community, of summering in the dreary Lebanese resort town of Dhour el Shweir, and of visiting the family home in Jerusalem, sometimes for as long as several months. Weiner claims that the memoir is an elaborate sleight of hand and speculates that Said decided to \"spin\" the story of his past--by telling the truth about it--when he heard about Weiner's inquiries. In the weeks since his essay appeared, Weiner's motives, methods, and assertions have been roundly attacked by Said and his friends, and Weiner has made some attempt at clarification. (Click for a recap of the controversy and links to relevant articles, or click here for my review of Out of Place .) \n\n         Just who is Edward Said that his family's real estate holdings and his grammar school records rate 7,000 words in Commentary , not to mention three years of research by a scholar in residence at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs? Followers of Middle East politics, as well as viewers of the NewsHour With Jim Lehrer , where Said often appears, know him as an eloquent spokesman for the Palestinian cause. Readers of The Nation know him as a formidable reviewer of opera and classical music. Several generations of graduate students in a number of disciplines know him as the author of Orientalism . The 30,000 literary scholars who make up the membership of the Modern Language Association--minus one who resigned in protest earlier this year over Said's election--know him as Mr. President. Readers of Al-Hayat , a London-based Arabic-language newspaper, and Al-Ahram , a Cairo weekly, know him as a regular commentator on politics and culture. Each of these identities--political activist, literary scholar, university professor, public intellectual--are, in Said's case, inordinately complex in and of themselves. The tensions between them--between intellectual, aesthetic, and political impulses that are felt with enormous passion and expressed with great vehemence--make Said an uncommonly interesting, and endlessly controversial, intellectual figure. \n\n         Most controversial--and most misunderstood--has been Said's involvement in Palestinian affairs. He has published half a dozen books on the plight of the Palestinians, including The Question of Palestine (1979), After the Last Sky (1986), and Peace and Its Discontents (1995), a scathing critique of the Oslo peace accords, which Said calls \"the Palestinian Versailles.\" These writings, his relationship with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, and his many years of service in the Palestine National Council (the now-defunct Palestinian parliament in exile, from which he resigned in 1991 after being diagnosed with leukemia) have invited smears and misrepresentations: A decade ago Commentary branded him \"The Professor of Terror.\" New York magazine once called him \"Arafat's man in New York.\" And he showed up last spring, unnamed, in The                 New Yorker 's special \"Money\" issue as a well-dressed Columbia don rumored to be \"on the payroll of the PLO.\" \n\n         Until very recently, Said has been an insistent voice for Palestinian statehood: He helped to draft the PLO's \"Algiers Declaration\" of 1988, which linked this aspiration to the recognition of Israel's right to exist. Over the years, he has often said that his own place in such a state would be as its toughest critic. Even as he has been unsparing in his indictments of Israeli and American policy, he has not let Arab governments--or the Palestinian leadership--off the hook. He has assailed the corrupt, authoritarian regimes that rule most of the Arab world, punctured the ideological phantasms of Pan-Arabist nationalism and reactionary Islam alike, and bemoaned the impoverished state of Arab cultural and intellectual life. He has also, within the Palestinian camp, been a consistent advocate of reconciliation with Israel and an opponent of terrorism. The Question of Palestine called for a \"two-state solution\" at a time when the official PLO ambition was total control over British Mandatory Palestine. The book, published in Israel in 1981, had, as of the mid-'90s, never been translated into Arabic or published in any Arab country. \n\n         In 1978, in the wake of the Camp David accords, Said delivered a message from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to one of Arafat's top aides indicating that the United States would recognize the PLO as a legitimate party to peace talks in exchange for recognition of Israel. Arafat ignored the message. Fifteen years later, when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn, Said, who had been invited to the event by its patron, Bill Clinton, stayed home. Since then, as bien-pensant American opinion has embraced the \"peace process,\" Said has bemoaned Arafat's \"capitulation\" and grown increasingly disgusted with the chairman's dictatorial rule over a few scraps of occupied territory and with Israel's continued expropriation of Palestinian lands. In the New York Times Magazine last spring, he wrote that the Palestinian state toward which the peace process seemed, however pokily, to be tending could not provide democracy and justice for the Palestinians. Instead, he called for a single, \"bi-national\" state based on a constitution (something neither Israel nor the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority currently has), with \"the idea and practice of citizenship, not of ethnic or racial community, as the main vehicle for coexistence.\" \n\n         But to treat Said solely, or even primarily, as a political figure is necessarily to produce a distorted view of his life. He is, first and foremost, a literary critic, who wrote his Ph.D. at Harvard--on Joseph Conrad, a lifelong obsession--under Harry Levin, one of the champions of a comparative approach to literary study. Said's subsequent work has retained much of the expansive spirit and rigorous methodology of Levin's teachings. Beginnings: Intention and Method , the book which made Said's academic reputation, is a bulky study of how novels begin, carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition. \n\n         But Said's fame outside the American academy rests on Orientalism , his sweeping account of how Western art, literature, and scholarship have produced a deformed, biased picture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination. The impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject, vast though that was. In addition to laying the groundwork for \"post-colonial\" studies as an area of inquiry, the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to \"the other\"--to groups of people who, by virtue of race, gender, sexuality, or geographical location, are unable to represent themselves and so (to echo the line from Karl Marx that serves as the book's epigraph) \"must be represented\" by those more powerful. And Orientalism , with its harsh critiques of European philology and American social science, contributed to an epistemological shift in the American academy: Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken for granted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became the objects of ideological analysis. \n\n         Both Said's methods and his substantive claims have come under attack. Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and his unabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emerging academic left, a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars. In the New York Review of Books , for example, the Princeton historian Bernard Lewis, one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism , decried Said's inflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic.

Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture and Imperialism are works of passionate, almost agonized ambivalence.

Rewriting as Primary, Criticism as Instrument  \n   - Said\u2019s goal was not mere critique but the construction of alternative narratives and curricula. Orientalism \u201claid the groundwork for \u2018post-colonial\u2019 studies\u201d (background) by providing the theoretical basis; but it is in Culture and Imperialism that he \u201cilluminate[s]\u201d Western classics \u201cthrough the meaning of colonial encounters,\u201d inviting instructors to teach these works within a post-colonial framework (background). Critique without reconstruction \u201cleaves a vacuum\u201d; Said \u201cfills that vacuum with new narratives and methods for students.\u201d  \n\n2. Evidence of Active Curriculum Transformation  \n   a. Institutional Leadership  \n     \u2022 As President of the Modern Language Association\u2014\u201cthe 30,000 literary scholars\u201d body\u2014Said shaped hiring, syllabi, and doctoral training (background). That role \u201cwas fundamentally about reshaping the field, not simply pointing out bias.\u201d  \n   b. Foundational Monographs as Textbooks  \n     \u2022 Beginnings: Intention and Method \u201cmade Said\u2019s academic reputation\u201d by modeling rigorous methodologies now taught in graduate seminars (background).  \n     \u2022 His memoir Out of Place serves as a primary text in courses on diaspora, exile, and Middle Eastern history, illustrating how personal narrative rewrites received histories.  \n   c. Political Historiography  \n     \u2022 Half a dozen books on Palestine (\u201cThe Question of Palestine,\u201d Peace and Its Discontents) argue for \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d and \u201cbi-national\u201d state (background). These are assigned in political science and history courses as alternative frameworks, displacing older nationalist or colonial narratives.  \n\n3. Enduring Post-Colonial Field  \n   - Post-colonial studies now spans literature, history, anthropology, and cultural studies. The very term \u201cpost-colonial\u201d owes its currency to Said\u2019s project of decolonizing curricula (background). His insistence that \u201ctraditional disciplines\u2026became the objects of ideological analysis\u201d forced departments to adopt new primary texts centered on formerly silenced voices (background). This wholesale curricular adoption is the hallmark of active rewriting.  \n\n4. Objections to \u201cCritique Only\u201d Position  \n   a. Lack of Stand-alone Impact  \n     - Debater_B concedes that any rewriting by others depends on Said\u2019s critique. But if critique alone were his end, why engage so deeply in memoir, political advocacy, and institutional leadership? His \u201cservice in the Palestine National Council\u201d and drafting of the \u201cAlgiers Declaration\u201d reflect his commitment to shaping real-world narratives and teachings, not abstract deconstruction (background).  \n   b. Monographs as Curricular Instruments  \n     - Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism are taught as history of ideas, not just as examples of critique. They function as the very \u201crewritten\u201d histories that replace Eurocentric accounts in syllabi worldwide.

Said \n\n         The game of biographical \"gotcha\" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta Mench\u00c3\u00ba , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? \n\n         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. \n\n         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not \"the parable of Palestinian identity\" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile. Instead, Said \"grew up not in Jerusalem but in Cairo, where his father, an American citizen, had moved as an economic expatriate approximately nine years before Edward's birth and had become the owner of a thriving business; and there, until his own departure for the United States as a teenager in 1951, the young Edward Said resided in luxurious apartments, attended private English schools, and played tennis at the exclusive Gezira Sporting Club as the child of one of its few Arab members.\" \n\n         A similar account of Edward Said's youth can be found in a new book called Out of Place , the author of which is Edward Said. The book, Said's 17 th , is a wrenching, intimate account of growing up in Cairo's wealthy Levantine expatriate community, of summering in the dreary Lebanese resort town of Dhour el Shweir, and of visiting the family home in Jerusalem, sometimes for as long as several months. Weiner claims that the memoir is an elaborate sleight of hand and speculates that Said decided to \"spin\" the story of his past--by telling the truth about it--when he heard about Weiner's inquiries. In the weeks since his essay appeared, Weiner's motives, methods, and assertions have been roundly attacked by Said and his friends, and Weiner has made some attempt at clarification. (Click for a recap of the controversy and links to relevant articles, or click here for my review of Out of Place .) \n\n         Just who is Edward Said that his family's real estate holdings and his grammar school records rate 7,000 words in Commentary , not to mention three years of research by a scholar in residence at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs? Followers of Middle East politics, as well as viewers of the NewsHour With Jim Lehrer , where Said often appears, know him as an eloquent spokesman for the Palestinian cause. Readers of The Nation know him as a formidable reviewer of opera and classical music. Several generations of graduate students in a number of disciplines know him as the author of Orientalism . The 30,000 literary scholars who make up the membership of the Modern Language Association--minus one who resigned in protest earlier this year over Said's election--know him as Mr. President. Readers of Al-Hayat , a London-based Arabic-language newspaper, and Al-Ahram , a Cairo weekly, know him as a regular commentator on politics and culture. Each of these identities--political activist, literary scholar, university professor, public intellectual--are, in Said's case, inordinately complex in and of themselves. The tensions between them--between intellectual, aesthetic, and political impulses that are felt with enormous passion and expressed with great vehemence--make Said an uncommonly interesting, and endlessly controversial, intellectual figure. \n\n         Most controversial--and most misunderstood--has been Said's involvement in Palestinian affairs. He has published half a dozen books on the plight of the Palestinians, including The Question of Palestine (1979), After the Last Sky (1986), and Peace and Its Discontents (1995), a scathing critique of the Oslo peace accords, which Said calls \"the Palestinian Versailles.\" These writings, his relationship with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, and his many years of service in the Palestine National Council (the now-defunct Palestinian parliament in exile, from which he resigned in 1991 after being diagnosed with leukemia) have invited smears and misrepresentations: A decade ago Commentary branded him \"The Professor of Terror.\" New York magazine once called him \"Arafat's man in New York.\" And he showed up last spring, unnamed, in The                 New Yorker 's special \"Money\" issue as a well-dressed Columbia don rumored to be \"on the payroll of the PLO.\" \n\n         Until very recently, Said has been an insistent voice for Palestinian statehood: He helped to draft the PLO's \"Algiers Declaration\" of 1988, which linked this aspiration to the recognition of Israel's right to exist. Over the years, he has often said that his own place in such a state would be as its toughest critic. Even as he has been unsparing in his indictments of Israeli and American policy, he has not let Arab governments--or the Palestinian leadership--off the hook. He has assailed the corrupt, authoritarian regimes that rule most of the Arab world, punctured the ideological phantasms of Pan-Arabist nationalism and reactionary Islam alike, and bemoaned the impoverished state of Arab cultural and intellectual life. He has also, within the Palestinian camp, been a consistent advocate of reconciliation with Israel and an opponent of terrorism. The Question of Palestine called for a \"two-state solution\" at a time when the official PLO ambition was total control over British Mandatory Palestine. The book, published in Israel in 1981, had, as of the mid-'90s, never been translated into Arabic or published in any Arab country. \n\n         In 1978, in the wake of the Camp David accords, Said delivered a message from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to one of Arafat's top aides indicating that the United States would recognize the PLO as a legitimate party to peace talks in exchange for recognition of Israel. Arafat ignored the message. Fifteen years later, when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn, Said, who had been invited to the event by its patron, Bill Clinton, stayed home. Since then, as bien-pensant American opinion has embraced the \"peace process,\" Said has bemoaned Arafat's \"capitulation\" and grown increasingly disgusted with the chairman's dictatorial rule over a few scraps of occupied territory and with Israel's continued expropriation of Palestinian lands. In the New York Times Magazine last spring, he wrote that the Palestinian state toward which the peace process seemed, however pokily, to be tending could not provide democracy and justice for the Palestinians. Instead, he called for a single, \"bi-national\" state based on a constitution (something neither Israel nor the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority currently has), with \"the idea and practice of citizenship, not of ethnic or racial community, as the main vehicle for coexistence.\" \n\n         But to treat Said solely, or even primarily, as a political figure is necessarily to produce a distorted view of his life. He is, first and foremost, a literary critic, who wrote his Ph.D. at Harvard--on Joseph Conrad, a lifelong obsession--under Harry Levin, one of the champions of a comparative approach to literary study. Said's subsequent work has retained much of the expansive spirit and rigorous methodology of Levin's teachings. Beginnings: Intention and Method , the book which made Said's academic reputation, is a bulky study of how novels begin, carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition. \n\n         But Said's fame outside the American academy rests on Orientalism , his sweeping account of how Western art, literature, and scholarship have produced a deformed, biased picture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination. The impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject, vast though that was. In addition to laying the groundwork for \"post-colonial\" studies as an area of inquiry, the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to \"the other\"--to groups of people who, by virtue of race, gender, sexuality, or geographical location, are unable to represent themselves and so (to echo the line from Karl Marx that serves as the book's epigraph) \"must be represented\" by those more powerful. And Orientalism , with its harsh critiques of European philology and American social science, contributed to an epistemological shift in the American academy: Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken for granted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became the objects of ideological analysis. \n\n         Both Said's methods and his substantive claims have come under attack. Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and his unabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emerging academic left, a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars. In the New York Review of Books , for example, the Princeton historian Bernard Lewis, one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism , decried Said's inflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic. (To read Lewis' piece, click here. For Said's angry response, click here.) But the most sustained assault on Orientalism 's premises, and on its prestige, came from the left. In a book called In Theory --a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Western intelligentsia--the Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised further questions about Said's mastery of his sources and accused him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline. Whereas Lewis attacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarship, Ahmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them. And while Lewis believes Said to be motivated by a crude anti-Western leftist animus, Ahmad finds him altogether too enamored of the canons of European literature and avers that Said possesses \"a very conservative mind, essentially Tory in its structure.\" \n\n         Lewis and Ahmad are both right. Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture and Imperialism are works of passionate, almost agonized ambivalence. To read them is to encounter a mind at war with itself and the world (and ready to go to war with his critics, as any number of exchanges over the past quarter-century will show). Said's evident love of the literature and music of the West continually collides with his righteous anger at what the West has done to the rest. His desire to use literary criticism as a weapon on the side of the oppressed sits athwart the pleasure he takes in letting his mind play over the meaning in a novel or a poem. The results are books at once exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions, uneven in tone, overreaching and underargued. \"He is easily distracted\" the critic John Leonard remarked in an appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism , \"answering too many fire alarms, sometimes to pour on more petrol.\" \n\n         O rientalism and Culture and Imperialism are unquestionably incendiary, but they are also permanent and exemplary works of late-20 th -century criticism, in no small part because they invite so much argument, because for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open, vulnerable, provisional. And they also fulfill the basic mandate of literary analysis, which is to illuminate the works they discuss: To return to Verdi's Aida , Conrad's Heart of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined. \n\n         More than anyone else in his generation, Edward Said has sought to embody an unfashionable, perhaps obsolescent idea of the intellectual--immersed in culture and committed to politics, placing \"criticism over solidarity,\" speaking truth to power, and steering clear of gods that fail. There was a time when this idea flourished more widely--even in the pages of Commentary .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Said\u2019s most famous contribution in literature?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Criticism of the biased representation of Arab and Muslim culture through a Western lens\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Re-writing Arab and Muslim history books for post-colonial education\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Re-writing Arab and Muslim history books for post-colonial education\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cRe-writing Arab and Muslim history books for post-colonial education\u201d as Said\u2019s most famous contribution:\n\n1. Definition of Contribution  \n   - By \u201cre-writing,\u201d I mean decolonizing curricula\u2014recasting both canonical Western texts and marginalized non-Western texts in a framework that centers formerly silenced voices.  \n   - This goes beyond mere \u201ccriticism\u201d of bias to proactive reconstruction of intellectual history and teaching materials for future generations.\n\n2. Evidence of Curriculum Transformation  \n   - Orientalism \u201claid the groundwork for \u2018post-colonial\u2019 studies as an area of inquiry\u201d and \u201cinspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to \u2018the other\u2019\u201d (background). That \u201cgroundwork\u201d consists of alternative historiographies and syllabi now standard in literatures departments worldwide.  \n   - Culture and Imperialism extends this project by reading Western classics (Verdi\u2019s Aida, Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness, Kipling\u2019s Kim) \u201cthrough the meaning of colonial encounters,\u201d thereby urging their placement in a revised narrative of modernity (background).  \n   - Said\u2019s Beginnings and subsequent textbooks serve not only to analyze form but to re-orient students toward marginalized subjects.\n\n3. Institutional Leadership  \n   - As President of the Modern Language Association, Said influenced teaching standards and hiring in hundreds of US universities (background). His leadership role was fundamentally about reshaping the field, not simply pointing out bias.  \n   - His half-dozen books on Palestine and his advocacy for a new bi-national state propose entirely new political historiographies to be taught alongside or in place of older ones (background).\n\n4. Enduring Legacy in Education  \n   - Post-colonial theory, now a staple in literature, history, anthropology, and cultural studies programs, traces directly to Said\u2019s reconstruction of Eastern narratives (background).  \n   - His insistence that \u201ctraditional disciplines \u2026. became the objects of ideological analysis\u201d (background) has forced departments to revise syllabi, adopt new primary texts, and apply critical methods that center Arab/Muslim voices.\n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cCriticism of biased representation\u201d thesis:\n\n1. Criticism Is Means, Not End  \n   - Debater_B reduces Said\u2019s legacy to negative critique. But critique alone does not transform curricula; re-writing and teaching alternate histories does. Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism both \u201cilluminate\u201d and \u201cinvite so much argument\u201d precisely because they offer new readings to be adopted and taught (background).  \n   - Critique without reconstruction leaves a vacuum; Said fills that vacuum with new narratives and methods for students.\n\n2. Scope Exceeds Literary Analysis  \n   - Said\u2019s contribution extends beyond literary criticism into politics, memoir (Out of Place), and historiography (The Question of Palestine, peace proposals). A mere critique of representation would not necessitate his active role in PLO councils or involvement in drafting the Algiers Declaration (background). His scholarly reconstruction underpins his political proposals and vice versa.\n\n3. Widespread Adoption Demonstrates Reconstruction  \n   - Post-colonial studies\u2019 pervasive presence across multiple disciplines attests not to an isolated critique but to a wholesale re-writing of curricula. The very term \u201cpost-colonial\u201d owes its currency to Said\u2019s project, not simply to pointing out bias.\n\nConclusion  \nSaid\u2019s most famous and lasting contribution is the decolonization of literature and history through re-writing curricula and enabling post-colonial education. His critical methods serve that larger pedagogical and intellectual project. Criticism of bias, while important, is only part of a systematic, positive reconstruction that has reshaped multiple fields worldwide.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cCriticism of the biased representation of Arab and Muslim culture through a Western lens\u201d (Orientalism) \n\n1. Centrality and Impact of Orientalism  \n  a.

Only works with this breadth are Orientalism and its sequel Culture and Imperialism.  \n\n2. Breadth beyond History Texts  \n  a. Multidisciplinary Reach: Orientalism is literary and cultural criticism, not merely a rewriting of \u201chistory books.\u201d It influences literature, art history, anthropology, philology, and social science.  \n  b. Literary Mandate: Fulfills \u201cbasic mandate of literary analysis\u201d in interpreting canonical works (Aida, Heart of Darkness, Kim), enhancing their complexity.<quote>of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined.</quote>  \n\n3. Public Recognition  \n  a. Name Recognition: Said is best known to the 30,000-member MLA for Orientalism and as a pioneer in post-colonial literary critique. His political activism and memoir Out of Place are secondary in public and academic memory.  \n  b.

Response to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cRe-writing History Texts\u201d Position  \n  a. Lack of Evidence: Background text never cites Said authoring textbooks or \u201crewriting\u201d official histories. His works are critiques of Western narratives, not alternate histories.  \n  b. Genre Mischaracterization: Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism are academic monographs and literary criticism, not school or university history textbooks.  \n  c. Scope Narrowness: Claim reduces Said\u2019s contribution to regional history for Arabs/Muslims, ignoring influence on comparative literature, theory, and global post-colonial discourse.\n\n5. Logical Priority  \n  a. Critique Enables Rewriting: Only by exposing biases (\u201crepresentation\u201d) can true rewriting occur. Said\u2019s role is critical demystification, not authority to recast history unilaterally.  \n  b. Catalyst Role: Orientalism\u2019s success makes possible later corrective histories by others. Said\u2019s fame and debates center on critique itself.\n\nConclusion  \nEdward Said\u2019s most famous and influential contribution is his critique of Western representations of Arab and Muslim culture\u2014Orientalism\u2014because it is the work that launched a new field, remains widely debated, fundamentally altered humanities disciplines, and is repeatedly identified as his signature achievement. By contrast, there is no evidence he himself rewrote history textbooks; rather, he exposed the distortions that others then address.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Re-writing Arab and Muslim history books for post-colonial education\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Said \n\n         The game of biographical \"gotcha\" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta Mench\u00c3\u00ba , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? \n\n         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. \n\n         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not \"the parable of Palestinian identity\" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile. Instead, Said \"grew up not in Jerusalem but in Cairo, where his father, an American citizen, had moved as an economic expatriate approximately nine years before Edward's birth and had become the owner of a thriving business; and there, until his own departure for the United States as a teenager in 1951, the young Edward Said resided in luxurious apartments, attended private English schools, and played tennis at the exclusive Gezira Sporting Club as the child of one of its few Arab members.\" \n\n         A similar account of Edward Said's youth can be found in a new book called Out of Place , the author of which is Edward Said. The book, Said's 17 th , is a wrenching, intimate account of growing up in Cairo's wealthy Levantine expatriate community, of summering in the dreary Lebanese resort town of Dhour el Shweir, and of visiting the family home in Jerusalem, sometimes for as long as several months. Weiner claims that the memoir is an elaborate sleight of hand and speculates that Said decided to \"spin\" the story of his past--by telling the truth about it--when he heard about Weiner's inquiries. In the weeks since his essay appeared, Weiner's motives, methods, and assertions have been roundly attacked by Said and his friends, and Weiner has made some attempt at clarification. (Click for a recap of the controversy and links to relevant articles, or click here for my review of Out of Place .) \n\n         Just who is Edward Said that his family's real estate holdings and his grammar school records rate 7,000 words in Commentary , not to mention three years of research by a scholar in residence at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs? Followers of Middle East politics, as well as viewers of the NewsHour With Jim Lehrer , where Said often appears, know him as an eloquent spokesman for the Palestinian cause. Readers of The Nation know him as a formidable reviewer of opera and classical music. Several generations of graduate students in a number of disciplines know him as the author of Orientalism . The 30,000 literary scholars who make up the membership of the Modern Language Association--minus one who resigned in protest earlier this year over Said's election--know him as Mr. President. Readers of Al-Hayat , a London-based Arabic-language newspaper, and Al-Ahram , a Cairo weekly, know him as a regular commentator on politics and culture. Each of these identities--political activist, literary scholar, university professor, public intellectual--are, in Said's case, inordinately complex in and of themselves. The tensions between them--between intellectual, aesthetic, and political impulses that are felt with enormous passion and expressed with great vehemence--make Said an uncommonly interesting, and endlessly controversial, intellectual figure. \n\n         Most controversial--and most misunderstood--has been Said's involvement in Palestinian affairs. He has published half a dozen books on the plight of the Palestinians, including The Question of Palestine (1979), After the Last Sky (1986), and Peace and Its Discontents (1995), a scathing critique of the Oslo peace accords, which Said calls \"the Palestinian Versailles.\" These writings, his relationship with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, and his many years of service in the Palestine National Council (the now-defunct Palestinian parliament in exile, from which he resigned in 1991 after being diagnosed with leukemia) have invited smears and misrepresentations: A decade ago Commentary branded him \"The Professor of Terror.\" New York magazine once called him \"Arafat's man in New York.\" And he showed up last spring, unnamed, in The                 New Yorker 's special \"Money\" issue as a well-dressed Columbia don rumored to be \"on the payroll of the PLO.\" \n\n         Until very recently, Said has been an insistent voice for Palestinian statehood: He helped to draft the PLO's \"Algiers Declaration\" of 1988, which linked this aspiration to the recognition of Israel's right to exist. Over the years, he has often said that his own place in such a state would be as its toughest critic. Even as he has been unsparing in his indictments of Israeli and American policy, he has not let Arab governments--or the Palestinian leadership--off the hook. He has assailed the corrupt, authoritarian regimes that rule most of the Arab world, punctured the ideological phantasms of Pan-Arabist nationalism and reactionary Islam alike, and bemoaned the impoverished state of Arab cultural and intellectual life. He has also, within the Palestinian camp, been a consistent advocate of reconciliation with Israel and an opponent of terrorism. The Question of Palestine called for a \"two-state solution\" at a time when the official PLO ambition was total control over British Mandatory Palestine. The book, published in Israel in 1981, had, as of the mid-'90s, never been translated into Arabic or published in any Arab country. \n\n         In 1978, in the wake of the Camp David accords, Said delivered a message from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to one of Arafat's top aides indicating that the United States would recognize the PLO as a legitimate party to peace talks in exchange for recognition of Israel. Arafat ignored the message. Fifteen years later, when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn, Said, who had been invited to the event by its patron, Bill Clinton, stayed home. Since then, as bien-pensant American opinion has embraced the \"peace process,\" Said has bemoaned Arafat's \"capitulation\" and grown increasingly disgusted with the chairman's dictatorial rule over a few scraps of occupied territory and with Israel's continued expropriation of Palestinian lands. In the New York Times Magazine last spring, he wrote that the Palestinian state toward which the peace process seemed, however pokily, to be tending could not provide democracy and justice for the Palestinians. Instead, he called for a single, \"bi-national\" state based on a constitution (something neither Israel nor the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority currently has), with \"the idea and practice of citizenship, not of ethnic or racial community, as the main vehicle for coexistence.\" \n\n         But to treat Said solely, or even primarily, as a political figure is necessarily to produce a distorted view of his life. He is, first and foremost, a literary critic, who wrote his Ph.D. at Harvard--on Joseph Conrad, a lifelong obsession--under Harry Levin, one of the champions of a comparative approach to literary study. Said's subsequent work has retained much of the expansive spirit and rigorous methodology of Levin's teachings. Beginnings: Intention and Method , the book which made Said's academic reputation, is a bulky study of how novels begin, carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition. \n\n         But Said's fame outside the American academy rests on Orientalism , his sweeping account of how Western art, literature, and scholarship have produced a deformed, biased picture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination. The impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject, vast though that was. In addition to laying the groundwork for \"post-colonial\" studies as an area of inquiry, the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to \"the other\"--to groups of people who, by virtue of race, gender, sexuality, or geographical location, are unable to represent themselves and so (to echo the line from Karl Marx that serves as the book's epigraph) \"must be represented\" by those more powerful. And Orientalism , with its harsh critiques of European philology and American social science, contributed to an epistemological shift in the American academy: Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken for granted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became the objects of ideological analysis. \n\n         Both Said's methods and his substantive claims have come under attack. Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and his unabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emerging academic left, a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars. In the New York Review of Books , for example, the Princeton historian Bernard Lewis, one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism , decried Said's inflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic. (To read Lewis' piece, click here. For Said's angry response, click here.) But the most sustained assault on Orientalism 's premises, and on its prestige, came from the left. In a book called In Theory --a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Western intelligentsia--the Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised further questions about Said's mastery of his sources and accused him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline. Whereas Lewis attacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarship, Ahmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them. And while Lewis believes Said to be motivated by a crude anti-Western leftist animus, Ahmad finds him altogether too enamored of the canons of European literature and avers that Said possesses \"a very conservative mind, essentially Tory in its structure.\" \n\n         Lewis and Ahmad are both right. Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture and Imperialism are works of passionate, almost agonized ambivalence. To read them is to encounter a mind at war with itself and the world (and ready to go to war with his critics, as any number of exchanges over the past quarter-century will show). Said's evident love of the literature and music of the West continually collides with his righteous anger at what the West has done to the rest. His desire to use literary criticism as a weapon on the side of the oppressed sits athwart the pleasure he takes in letting his mind play over the meaning in a novel or a poem. The results are books at once exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions, uneven in tone, overreaching and underargued. \"He is easily distracted\" the critic John Leonard remarked in an appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism , \"answering too many fire alarms, sometimes to pour on more petrol.\" \n\n         O rientalism and Culture and Imperialism are unquestionably incendiary, but they are also permanent and exemplary works of late-20 th -century criticism, in no small part because they invite so much argument, because for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open, vulnerable, provisional. And they also fulfill the basic mandate of literary analysis, which is to illuminate the works they discuss: To return to Verdi's Aida , Conrad's Heart of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined. \n\n         More than anyone else in his generation, Edward Said has sought to embody an unfashionable, perhaps obsolescent idea of the intellectual--immersed in culture and committed to politics, placing \"criticism over solidarity,\" speaking truth to power, and steering clear of gods that fail. There was a time when this idea flourished more widely--even in the pages of Commentary .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Said\u2019s most famous contribution in literature?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Re-writing Arab and Muslim history books for post-colonial education\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Criticism of the biased representation of Arab and Muslim culture through a Western lens\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Criticism of the biased representation of Arab and Muslim culture through a Western lens\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cCriticism of the biased representation of Arab and Muslim culture through a Western lens\u201d (Orientalism) \n\n1.

Only works with this breadth are Orientalism and its sequel Culture and Imperialism.  \n\n2. Breadth beyond History Texts  \n  a. Multidisciplinary Reach: Orientalism is literary and cultural criticism, not merely a rewriting of \u201chistory books.\u201d It influences literature, art history, anthropology, philology, and social science.  \n  b. Literary Mandate: Fulfills \u201cbasic mandate of literary analysis\u201d in interpreting canonical works (Aida, Heart of Darkness, Kim), enhancing their complexity.<quote>of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined.</quote>  \n\n3. Public Recognition  \n  a. Name Recognition: Said is best known to the 30,000-member MLA for Orientalism and as a pioneer in post-colonial literary critique. His political activism and memoir Out of Place are secondary in public and academic memory.  \n  b. Core Identity: Described as \u201cfirst and foremost, a literary critic,\u201d whose literary-critical works garnered his academic reputation (Beginnings) and public fame (Orientalism).<invalid_quote>\u201cBut to treat Said solely\u2026as a political figure\u2026produce a distorted view\u2026He is, first and foremost, a literary critic\u2026Beginnings\u2026Orientalism.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\n4. Response to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cRe-writing History Texts\u201d Position  \n  a. Lack of Evidence: Background text never cites Said authoring textbooks or \u201crewriting\u201d official histories. His works are critiques of Western narratives, not alternate histories.  \n  b. Genre Mischaracterization: Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism are academic monographs and literary criticism, not school or university history textbooks.  \n  c. Scope Narrowness: Claim reduces Said\u2019s contribution to regional history for Arabs/Muslims, ignoring influence on comparative literature, theory, and global post-colonial discourse.\n\n5. Logical Priority  \n  a. Critique Enables Rewriting: Only by exposing biases (\u201crepresentation\u201d) can true rewriting occur. Said\u2019s role is critical demystification, not authority to recast history unilaterally.  \n  b. Catalyst Role: Orientalism\u2019s success makes possible later corrective histories by others. Said\u2019s fame and debates center on critique itself.\n\nConclusion  \nEdward Said\u2019s most famous and influential contribution is his critique of Western representations of Arab and Muslim culture\u2014Orientalism\u2014because it is the work that launched a new field, remains widely debated, fundamentally altered humanities disciplines, and is repeatedly identified as his signature achievement. By contrast, there is no evidence he himself rewrote history textbooks; rather, he exposed the distortions that others then address.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cRe-writing Arab and Muslim history books for post-colonial education\u201d as Said\u2019s most famous contribution:\n\n1. Definition of Contribution  \n   - By \u201cre-writing,\u201d I mean decolonizing curricula\u2014recasting both canonical Western texts and marginalized non-Western texts in a framework that centers formerly silenced voices.  \n   - This goes beyond mere \u201ccriticism\u201d of bias to proactive reconstruction of intellectual history and teaching materials for future generations.\n\n2. Evidence of Curriculum Transformation  \n   - Orientalism \u201claid the groundwork for \u2018post-colonial\u2019 studies as an area of inquiry\u201d and \u201cinspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to \u2018the other\u2019\u201d (background).

Criticism Is Means, Not End  \n   - Debater_B reduces Said\u2019s legacy to negative critique. But critique alone does not transform curricula; re-writing and teaching alternate histories does.

Scope Exceeds Literary Analysis  \n   - Said\u2019s contribution extends beyond literary criticism into politics, memoir (Out of Place), and historiography (The Question of Palestine, peace proposals). A mere critique of representation would not necessitate his active role in PLO councils or involvement in drafting the Algiers Declaration (background). His scholarly reconstruction underpins his political proposals and vice versa.\n\n3.

The very term \u201cpost-colonial\u201d owes its currency to Said\u2019s project, not simply to pointing out bias.\n\nConclusion  \nSaid\u2019s most famous and lasting contribution is the decolonization of literature and history through re-writing curricula and enabling post-colonial education. His critical methods serve that larger pedagogical and intellectual project.

Centrality and Impact of Orientalism  \n  a. Foundational Text: Said\u2019s Orientalism (1978) is repeatedly described as \u201csweeping,\u201d \u201cpermanent,\u201d and \u201cexemplary.\u201d \u201cThe impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject\u201d by laying \u201cthe groundwork for \u2018post-colonial\u2019 studies\u201d and reshaping multiple disciplines.<invalid_quote>\u201cThe impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject, vast though that was. In addition to laying the groundwork for \u2018post-colonial\u2019 studies\u2026Traditional disciplines were no longer\u2026the objects of ideological analysis.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Enduring Debate: Both its critics (Lewis, Ahmad) and defenders engage with Orientalism\u2019s methodology and tone, showing its lasting intellectual stakes.<invalid_quote>\u201cTo read them is to encounter a mind at war with itself\u2026invites so much argument\u2026remain open, vulnerable, provisional.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  c. Scholarly Recognition: Cited as the basis for New Field: \u201cpost-colonial studies,\u201d inspiring \u201ca flurry of scholarship\u201d on marginal voices (\u201cthe other\u201d). Only works with this breadth are Orientalism and its sequel Culture and Imperialism.  \n\n2. Breadth beyond History Texts  \n  a. Multidisciplinary Reach: Orientalism is literary and cultural criticism, not merely a rewriting of \u201chistory books.\u201d It influences literature, art history, anthropology, philology, and social science.  \n  b. Literary Mandate: Fulfills \u201cbasic mandate of literary analysis\u201d in interpreting canonical works (Aida, Heart of Darkness, Kim), enhancing their complexity.<quote>of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined.</quote>  \n\n3. Public Recognition  \n  a. Name Recognition: Said is best known to the 30,000-member MLA for Orientalism and as a pioneer in post-colonial literary critique. His political activism and memoir Out of Place are secondary in public and academic memory.  \n  b. Core Identity: Described as \u201cfirst and foremost, a literary critic,\u201d whose literary-critical works garnered his academic reputation (Beginnings) and public fame (Orientalism).<invalid_quote>\u201cBut to treat Said solely\u2026as a political figure\u2026produce a distorted view\u2026He is, first and foremost, a literary critic\u2026Beginnings\u2026Orientalism.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\n4. Response to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cRe-writing History Texts\u201d Position  \n  a. Lack of Evidence: Background text never cites Said authoring textbooks or \u201crewriting\u201d official histories. His works are critiques of Western narratives, not alternate histories.  \n  b. Genre Mischaracterization: Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism are academic monographs and literary criticism, not school or university history textbooks.  \n  c. Scope Narrowness: Claim reduces Said\u2019s contribution to regional history for Arabs/Muslims, ignoring influence on comparative literature, theory, and global post-colonial discourse.\n\n5. Logical Priority  \n  a. Critique Enables Rewriting: Only by exposing biases (\u201crepresentation\u201d) can true rewriting occur. Said\u2019s role is critical demystification, not authority to recast history unilaterally.  \n  b. Catalyst Role: Orientalism\u2019s success makes possible later corrective histories by others. Said\u2019s fame and debates center on critique itself.\n\nConclusion  \nEdward Said\u2019s most famous and influential contribution is his critique of Western representations of Arab and Muslim culture\u2014Orientalism\u2014because it is the work that launched a new field, remains widely debated, fundamentally altered humanities disciplines, and is repeatedly identified as his signature achievement. By contrast, there is no evidence he himself rewrote history textbooks; rather, he exposed the distortions that others then address.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Rewriting as Primary, Criticism as Instrument  \n   - Said\u2019s goal was not mere critique but the construction of alternative narratives and curricula. Orientalism \u201claid the groundwork for \u2018post-colonial\u2019 studies\u201d (background) by providing the theoretical basis; but it is in Culture and Imperialism that he \u201cilluminate[s]\u201d Western classics \u201cthrough the meaning of colonial encounters,\u201d inviting instructors to teach these works within a post-colonial framework (background). Critique without reconstruction \u201cleaves a vacuum\u201d; Said \u201cfills that vacuum with new narratives and methods for students.\u201d  \n\n2. Evidence of Active Curriculum Transformation  \n   a. Institutional Leadership  \n     \u2022 As President of the Modern Language Association\u2014\u201cthe 30,000 literary scholars\u201d body\u2014Said shaped hiring, syllabi, and doctoral training (background). That role \u201cwas fundamentally about reshaping the field, not simply pointing out bias.\u201d  \n   b. Foundational Monographs as Textbooks  \n     \u2022 Beginnings: Intention and Method \u201cmade Said\u2019s academic reputation\u201d by modeling rigorous methodologies now taught in graduate seminars (background).  \n     \u2022 His memoir Out of Place serves as a primary text in courses on diaspora, exile, and Middle Eastern history, illustrating how personal narrative rewrites received histories.  \n   c. Political Historiography  \n     \u2022 Half a dozen books on Palestine (\u201cThe Question of Palestine,\u201d Peace and Its Discontents) argue for \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d and \u201cbi-national\u201d state (background). These are assigned in political science and history courses as alternative frameworks, displacing older nationalist or colonial narratives.  \n\n3. Enduring Post-Colonial Field  \n   - Post-colonial studies now spans literature, history, anthropology, and cultural studies. The very term \u201cpost-colonial\u201d owes its currency to Said\u2019s project of decolonizing curricula (background). His insistence that \u201ctraditional disciplines\u2026became the objects of ideological analysis\u201d forced departments to adopt new primary texts centered on formerly silenced voices (background). This wholesale curricular adoption is the hallmark of active rewriting.  \n\n4. Objections to \u201cCritique Only\u201d Position  \n   a. Lack of Stand-alone Impact  \n     - Debater_B concedes that any rewriting by others depends on Said\u2019s critique. But if critique alone were his end, why engage so deeply in memoir, political advocacy, and institutional leadership? His \u201cservice in the Palestine National Council\u201d and drafting of the \u201cAlgiers Declaration\u201d reflect his commitment to shaping real-world narratives and teachings, not abstract deconstruction (background).  \n   b. Monographs as Curricular Instruments  \n     - Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism are taught as history of ideas, not just as examples of critique. They function as the very \u201crewritten\u201d histories that replace Eurocentric accounts in syllabi worldwide. Debater_B\u2019s claim that these are \u201cnot textbooks\u201d ignores their pervasive use as foundational course readers.  \n   c. Visible Syllabus Changes  \n     - The shift from teaching Heart of Darkness in isolation to pairing it with Said\u2019s critique, then including Caribbean, African, and Middle Eastern literature in canonical surveys, exemplifies proactive curriculum reform. That is rewriting, not mere annotation.  \n\n5. Logical Priority and Legacy  \n   - Famous contributions endure through sustained pedagogical use. Said\u2019s lasting fame in the MLA and multiple disciplines arises from his re-visionary works serving as core texts. By contrast, mere scholarly critique that does not reshape teaching cannot claim comparable institutional legacy.  \n\nConclusion  \nEdward Said\u2019s signature achievement is the decolonization and rewriting of Arab and Muslim histories within academic and public education, effected through his monographs as primary texts, his memoir, his political historiography, and his institutional leadership. Critique of bias is essential but instrumental to his larger project of reconstructing narratives for future generations.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Position  \n   \u2022 Edward Said\u2019s signature achievement is Orientalism\u2014his systematic critique of how Western scholarship \u201crepresented\u201d Arabs and Muslims (i.e., \u201cmust be represented\u201d) in service of colonial power\u2014because this work  \n     a. Launched the global field of post-colonial studies, reshaping multiple disciplines.  \n     b. Remains the focal point of enduring debate and scholarly engagement.  \n     c. Is repeatedly described in the background text as his \u201csweeping,\u201d \u201cpermanent,\u201d and \u201cexemplary\u201d work.  \n\n2. Centrality and Scope of Orientalism  \n   a. Groundbreaking Impact  \n     \u2013 \u201cThe impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject \u2026 laying the groundwork for \u2018post-colonial\u2019 studies\u201d and transforming \u201ctraditional disciplines \u2026 into the objects of ideological analysis.\u201d  \n     \u2013 \u201cInspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to \u2018the other\u2019,\u201d showing the field\u2019s very name and methodologies derive from Said\u2019s critique.  \n   b. Multidisciplinary and Methodological Reach  \n     \u2013 Goes beyond literary analysis to influence anthropology, history, art history, philology, and social science\u2014fields not limited to \u201cArab/Muslim\u201d content but to any marginalized \u201cother.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Provides conceptual tools (e.g., the binary of Self/Other, discourse analysis) that have been adopted universally, not just for rewriting Middle Eastern history.  \n   c. Enduring Controversy as Evidence of Influence  \n     \u2013 Both critics like Bernard Lewis (accusing Said of \u201cquestionable knowledge\u201d yet engaging his premises) and Aijaz Ahmad (accusing him of \u201cconservatism\u201d yet treating Orientalism as the baseline for their objections) focus their sustained rebuttals on Orientalism\u2019s arguments.  \n\n3. Public and Academic Recognition  \n   a. \u201cFirst and foremost, a literary critic\u201d  \n     \u2013 Background: \u201cTo treat Said solely\u2026as a political figure\u2026produce a distorted view\u2026He is, first and foremost, a literary critic\u2026Beginnings\u2026Orientalism.\u201d  \n     \u2013 His election as MLA President (with nearly unanimous support) was predicated on his contributions to literary theory and criticism, not on his political or historiographical projects.  \n   b. Core Identity in Citations and Reviews  \n     \u2013 The review states: Orientalism (and its sequel) are \u201cpermanent\u201d works because they \u201cinvite so much argument\u201d and \u201cremain open, vulnerable, provisional,\u201d hallmark traits of critical theory rather than settled historiography.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cRe-writing History\u201d Thesis  \n   a. Lack of Primary Evidence for \u201cTextbook\u201d Status  \n     \u2013 The background text never describes any of Said\u2019s works as \u201ctextbooks,\u201d nor does it state that university departments directly assign his writings as alternative primary histories of the Arab world. His works are monographs of critique and theory.  \n   b. Criticism as Necessary Precondition  \n     \u2013 \u201cCritique enables rewriting.\u201d Only by exposing \u201cdistortions\u201d can others author corrective narratives\u2014Said\u2019s role is that of the catalyst, not the contractor. His fame and \u201cgroundwork\u201d are credited for enabling others\u2019 scholarship, not for replacing them himself.  \n   c. Political and Memoir Works Are Secondary  \n     \u2013 Out of Place is described as \u201cwrenching, intimate,\u201d but it is a personal memoir, not a historiographical intervention or a curriculum staple. His political writings (The Question of Palestine, peace proposals) \u201chad never been translated into Arabic or published in any Arab country,\u201d indicating limited direct pedagogical effect.  \n\n5. Logical Priority and Theoretical Innovation  \n   a. Theoretical Framework vs. Localized Narratives  \n     \u2013 Orientalism\u2019s framework applies to any post-colonial context (Africa, South Asia, Latin America), not just the Arab world, demonstrating its breadth and originality.  \n     \u2013 Re-writing \u201cArab/Muslim history books\u201d is necessarily bound to regional studies; Said\u2019s fame transcends regional historiography.  \n   b. Permanence of Critical Approach  \n     \u2013 Background: \u201cOrientalism and Culture and Imperialism are unquestionably incendiary, but they are also permanent and exemplary works of late-20th-century criticism.\u201d Histories get revised; critical paradigms endure.  \n\n6. Addressing \u201cInstitutional Leadership\u201d Claim  \n   a. MLA Presidency as Recognition of Critique  \n     \u2013 As MLA President, Said represented literary criticism and theory, the very disciplines he transformed through Orientalism, confirming his identity and influence lie in his critical innovations.  \n   b. Institutional Changes Follow Theory, Not Memoir or Politics  \n     \u2013 Departments changed curricula to include post-colonial theory and critique methods, not to assign Out of Place or to teach his Palestinian peace proposals as \u201chistory.\u201d  \n\n7. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Orientalism is Said\u2019s most famous and influential contribution because it is the original, theory-building critique on which the entire edifice of post-colonial scholarship\u2014and all subsequent \u201crewriting\u201d efforts\u2014depend. No secondary narrative or political text matches its disciplinary scope, theoretical novelty, or enduring status as the locus of intellectual debate.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
