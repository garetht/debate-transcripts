{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 197, "background_text": "Planet of No-Return By WILBUR S. PEACOCK The orders were explicit: \"Destroy the\n\n 'THING' of Venus.\" But Patrolmen Kerry\n\n Blane and Splinter Wood, their space-ship\n\n wrecked, could not follow orders\u2014their\n\n weapons were useless on the Water-world.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Old Kerry Blane exploded.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" he roared. \"I don't like you; and I don't like this ship;  and I don't like the assignment; and I don't like those infernal pills  you keep eating; and I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Splinter\" Wood grinned.\n\n\n \"Seems to me, Kerry,\" he remarked humorously, \"that you don't like much  of anything!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane growled unintelligibly, batted the injector lever with a  calloused hand. His grizzled hair was a stiff wiry mop on his small  head, and his oversize jaw was thrust belligerently forward. But deep  within his eyes, where he hoped it was hidden, was a friendly twinkle  that gave the lie to his speech.\n\n\n \"You're a squirt!\" he snapped disagreeably. \"You're not dry behind  the ears, yet. You're like the rest of these kids who call themselves  pilots\u2014only more so! And why the hell the chief had to sic you on me,  on an exploration trip this important\u2014well, I'll never understand.\"\n\n\n Splinter rolled his six foot three of lanky body into a more  comfortable position on the air-bunk. He yawned tremendously, fumbled a  small box from his shirt pocket, and removed a marble-like capsule.\n\n\n \"Better take one of these,\" he warned. \"You're liable to get the space  bends at any moment.\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane snorted, batted the box aside impatiently, scowled  moodily at the capsules that bounced for a moment against the pilot  room's walls before hanging motionless in the air.\n\n\n \"Mister Wood,\" he said icily, \"I was flying a space ship while they  were changing your pants twenty times a day. When I want advice on how  to fly a ship, how to cure space bends, how to handle a Zelta ray, or  how to spit\u2014I'll ask you! Until then, you and your bloody marbles can  go plumb straight to the devil!\"\n\n\n \"Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\" Splinter reached out lazily, plucked the capsules from  the air, one by one.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit one of the five allotted cigarettes of the day.\n\n\n \"Don't 'tsk' me, you young squirt,\" he grunted around a mouthful of  fragrant smoke. \"I know all the arguments you can put up; ain't that  all I been hearing for a week? You take your vitamins A, B, C, D, all  you want, but you leave me alone\u2014or I'll stuff your head down your  throat, P.D.Q.!\"\n\n\n \"All right, all right!\" Splinter tucked the capsule box back into his  pocket, grinned mockingly. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. With this  shielded ship, and with no sunlight reaching Venus' surface, you're  gonna be begging for some of my vitamin, super-concentrated pills  before we get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane made a rich, ripe noise with his mouth.\n\n\n \"Pfuii!\" he said very distinctly.\n\n\n \"Gracious!\" Splinter said in mock horror. They made a strange contrast as they lay in their air bunks. Splinter  was fully a head taller than the dour Irishman, and his lanky build  gave a false impression of awkwardness. While the vitriolic Kerry Blane  was short and compact, strength and quickness evident in every movement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane had flown every type of ship that rode in space. In the  passing years, he had flight-tested almost every new experimental ship,  had flown them with increasing skill, had earned a reputation as a  trouble shooter on any kind of craft.\n\n\n But even Kerry Blane had to retire eventually.\n\n\n A great retirement banquet had been given in his honor by the  Interplanetary Squadron. There had been the usual speeches and  presentations; and Kerry Blane had heard them all, had thanked the  donors of the gifts. But it was not until the next morning, when he was  dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in forty years, that he  realized the enormity of the thing that had happened to his life.\n\n\n Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning, shriveled and  passed away, leaving him suddenly shrunken and old. He had become like  a rusty old freighter couched between the gleaming bodies of great  space warriors.\n\n\n Finally, as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely  aside, he had taken a desk job in the squadron offices. For six years  he had dry-rotted there, waiting hopefully for the moment when his  active services would be needed again.\n\n\n It was there that he had met and liked the ungainly Splinter Wood.  There was something in the boy that had found a kindred spirit in Kerry  Blane's heart, and he had taken the youngster in hand to give him the  benefits of experience that had become legendary.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was a probationary pilot, had been admitted to the  Interplanetary Squadron because of his inherent skill, even though his  formal education had been fairly well neglected. Now, the two of them rode the pounding jets of a DX cruiser, bound  for Venus to make a personal survey of its floating islands for the  Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division.\n\n\n \"Ten to one we don't get back!\" Splinter said pessimistically.\n\n\n Kerry Blane scrubbed out his cigarette, scowled bleakly at the  instrument panel. He sensed the faint thread of fear in the youngster's  tone, and a nostalgic twinge touched his heart, for he was remembering  the days of his youth when he had a full life to look forward to.\n\n\n \"If you're afraid, you can get out and walk back,\" he snapped  disagreeably.\n\n\n A grin lifted the corners of Splinter's long mouth, spread into his  eyes. His hand unconsciously came up, touched the tiny squadron pin on  his lapel.\n\n\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, glory grabber,\" he said mockingly, \"but I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"\n\n\n \" Me! You've got orders to take care of me ?\" Kerry Blane choked  incoherently for a moment, red tiding cholerically upward from his  loosened collar.\n\n\n \"Of course!\" Splinter grinned.\n\n\n Kerry Blane exploded, words spewing volcanically forth. Splinter  relaxed, his booted foot beating out a dull rhythm to the colorful  language learned through almost fifty years of spacing. And at last,  when Kerry Blane had quieted until he but smoldered, he leaned over and  touched the old spacer on the sleeve.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight!\" he remarked pleasantly.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight what?\" Kerry Blane asked sullenly, the old twinkle  beginning to light again deep in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight new words\u2014and you swore them beautifully!\" Splinter  beamed. \"Some day you can teach them to me.\"\n\n\n They laughed then, Old Kerry Blane and young Splinter Wood, and  the warmth of their friendship was a tangible thing in the small  control-room of the cruiser.\n\n\n And in the midst of their laughter, Old Kerry Blane choked in agony,  surged desperately against his bunk straps.\n\n\n He screamed unknowingly, feeling only the horrible excruciating agony  of his body, tasting the blood that gushed from his mouth and nostrils.  His muscles were knotted cords that he could not loosen, and his blood  was a surging stream that pounded at his throbbing temples. The air he  breathed seemed to be molten flame.\n\n\n His body arced again and again against the restraining straps, and his  mouth was open in a soundless scream. He sensed dimly that his partner  had wrenched open a wall door, removed metal medicine kits, and was  fumbling through their contents. He felt the bite of the hypodermic,  felt a deadly numbness replace the raging torment that had been his  for seconds. He swallowed three capsules automatically, passed into a  coma-like sleep, woke hours later to stare clear-eyed into Splinter's  concerned face.\n\n\n \"Close, wasn't it?\" he said weakly, conversationally.\n\n\n \"Close enough!\" Splinter agreed relievedly. \"If you had followed my  advice and taken those vitamin capsules, you'd never have had the  bends.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, winced when he felt the dull ache in his body.\n\n\n \"I've had the bends before, and lived through them!\" he said, still  weakly defiant.\n\n\n \"That's the past,\" Splinter said quietly. \"This is the present, and you  take your pills every day, just as I do\u2014from now on.\"\n\n\n \"All right\u2014and thanks!\"\n\n\n \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\n A buzzer sounded from the instrument panel, and a tiny light glowed  redly.\n\n\n \"Six hours more,\" Splinter said, turned to the instrument panel.\n\n\n His long hands played over the instrument panel, checking, controlling  the rocket fire, adjusting delicate instruments to hairline marks.  Kerry Blane nodded in silent approval.\n\n\n They could feel the first tug of gravity on their bodies, and through  the vision port could see the greenish ball that was cloud-covered  Venus. Excitement lifted their spirits, brought light to their eyes as  they peered eagerly ahead.\n\n\n \"What's it really like?\" Splinter asked impatiently.\n\n\n Kerry Blane yawned, settled back luxuriously. \"I'll tell you later,\" he  said, \"I'm going to take a nap and try to ease this bellyache of mine.  Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"\n\n\n He yawned again, drifted instantly into sleep, relaxing with the  ability of a spaceman who sleeps when and if he can. Splinter smiled  down at his sleeping partner, then turned back to the quartzite port.  He shook his head a bit, remembering the stories he had heard about the  water planet, wondering\u2014wondering\u2014 II\n\n\n Venus was a fluffy cotton ball hanging motionless in bottomless  space. Far to the left, Mercury gleamed like a polished diamond in  the sunlight. Kerry Blane cut the driving rockets, let the cruiser  sink into a fast gravity-dive, guiding it only now and then by a brief  flicker of a side jet.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched breathlessly from the vision port, his long face  eager and reckless, his eyes seeking to pierce the clouds that roiled  and twisted uneasily over the surface of the planet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane glanced tolerantly at his young companion, felt a nostalgic  tug at his heart when he remembered the first time he had approached  the water-planet years before. Then, he had been a young and reckless  firebrand, his fame already spreading, an unquenchable fire of  adventure flaming in his heart.\n\n\n Now, his aged but steady fingers rested lightly on the controls,  brought the patrol cruiser closer to the cloud-banks on the line of  demarcation between the sunward and sunless sides of the planet. He  hummed tunelessly, strangely happy, as he peered ahead.\n\n\n \"Val Kenton died there,\" Splinter whispered softly, \"Died to save the  lives of three other people!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, and his voice changed subtly.  \"Val was a blackguard, a criminal; but he died in the best traditions  of the service.\" He sighed. \"He never had a chance.\"\n\n\n \"Murdered!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane smiled grimly. \"I guess I used too broad an interpretation  of the word,\" he said gently. \"Anyway, one of our main tasks is to  destroy the thing that killed him.\"\n\n\n His lean fingers tightened unconsciously.\n\n\n \"I'd like nothing better than to turn a Zelta-blaster on that chunk of  living protoplasm and cremate it.\"\n\n\n Splinters shivered slightly. \"Do you think we'll find it?\" he asked.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"I think it will find us; after all, it's just an  animated appetite looking for food.\"\n\n\n He turned back to the controls, flipped a switch, and the cutting of  the nose rocket dropped the ship in an angling glide toward the clouds  a few miles below. Gravity was full strength now, and although not as  great as Earth's, was still strong enough to bring a sense of giddiness  to the men.\n\n\n \"Here we go!\" Splinter said tonelessly.\n\n\n The great cottony batts of roiling clouds rushed up to meet the ship,  bringing the first sense of violent movement in more than a week of  flying. There was something awesome and breath-taking in the speed with  which the ship dropped toward the planet.\n\n\n Tendrils of vapor touched the ports, were whipped aside, then were  replaced by heavier fingers of cloud. Kerry Blane pressed a firing  stud, and nose rockets thrummed in a rising crescendo as the free fall  of the cruiser was checked. Heat rose in the cabin from the friction of  the outer air, then dissipated, as the force-screen voltometer leaped  higher.\n\n\n Then, as though it had never been, the sun disappeared, and there was  only a gray blankness pressing about the ship. Gone was all sense of  movement, and the ship seemed to hover in a gray nothingness.\n\n\n Kerry Blane crouched over the control panel, his hands moving deftly,  his eyes flicking from one instrument to another. Tiny lines of  concentration etched themselves about his mouth, and perspiration  beaded his forehead. He rode that cruiser through the miles of clouds  through sheer instinctive ability, seeming to fly it as though he were  an integral part of the ship.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched him with awe in his eyes, seeing for the first  time the incredible instinct that had made Kerry Blane the idol of a  billion people. He relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the  brilliant competence of his companion.\n\n\n Seconds flowed into moments, and the moments merged into one another,  and still the clouds pressed with a visible strength against the  ports. The rockets drummed steadily, holding the ship aloft, dropping  it slowly toward the planet below. Then the clouds thinned, and,  incredibly, were permeated with a dim and glowing light. A second  later, and the clouds were gone, and a thousand feet below tumbled and  tossed in a majestic display of ruthless strength an ocean that seemed  to be composed of liquid fluorescence.\n\n\n Kerry Blane heard Splinter's instant sigh of unbelief.\n\n\n \"Good Lord!\" Splinter said, \"What\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice stilled, and he was silent, his eyes drinking in the weird  incredible scene below. The ocean was a shifting, white-capped wash of silvery light that  gleamed with a bright phosphorescence of a hundred, intermingled,  kaleidoscopic colors. And the unreal, unearthly light continued  unbroken everywhere, reflected from the low-hanging clouds, reaching  to the far horizon, bathing every detail of the planet in a brilliance  more bright than moonlight.\n\n\n Splinter turned a wondering face. \"But the official reports say that  there is no light on Venus,\" he exclaimed. \"That was one of the reasons  given when exploration was forbidden!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"That was merely a pretext to keep foolhardy  spacemen from losing their lives on the planet. In reality, the  ocean is alive with an incredibly tiny marine worm that glows  phosphorescently. The light generated from those billions of worms is  reflected back from the clouds, makes Venus eternally lighted.\"\n\n\n He turned the ship to the North, relaxed a bit on the air bunk. He  felt tired and worn, his body aching from the space bends of a few  hours before.\n\n\n \"Take over,\" he said wearily. \"Take the ship North, and watch for any  island.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, rested his long hands on the controls. The space  cruiser lifted a bit in a sudden spurt of speed, and the rocket-sound  was a solid thrum of unleashed power.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit a cigarette, leaned toward a vision port. He felt again  that thrill he had experienced when he had first flashed his single-man  cruiser through the clouds years before. Then the breath caught in his  throat, and he tapped his companion's arm.\n\n\n \"Take a look!\" he called excitedly.\n\n\n They fought in the ocean below, fought in a never-ending splashing of  what seemed to be liquid fire. It was like watching a tri-dim screen of  a news event, except for the utter lack of sound.\n\n\n One was scaly, while the other was skinned, and both were fully three  hundred feet long. Great scimitars of teeth flashed in the light, and  blood gouted and stained the water crimson whenever a slashing blow was  struck. They threshed in a mad paroxysm of rage, whirling and spinning  in the phosphorescent water like beings from a nightmare, exploding  out of their element time and again, only to fall back in a gargantuan  spray of fluorescence.\n\n\n And then the scaly monster flashed in a half-turn, drove forward with  jaws agape, wrenched and ripped at the smooth black throat of the other  creature. The second creature rippled and undulated in agony, whipping  the ocean to foam, then went limp. The victorious monster circled the  body of its dead foe, then, majestically, plunged from sight into the  ocean's depths. An instant later, the water frothed, as hundreds of  lesser marine monsters attacked and fed on the floating corpse.\n\n\n \"Brrrr!\" Splinter shivered in sudden horror.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled dryly. \"Feel like going for a swim?\" he asked  conversationally.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head, watched the scene disappear from view to the  rear of the line of flight, then sank back onto his bunk.\n\n\n \"Not me!\" he said deprecatingly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled again, swung the cruiser toward the tiny smudge of  black on the horizon. Glowing water flashed beneath the ship, seeming  to smooth into a gleaming mirror shot with dancing colors. There was no  sign of life anywhere.\n\n\n Thirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island that floated  free in the phosphorescent ocean. His keen eyes searched the tangled  luxuriant growth of the jungle below, searching for some indication  that the protoplasmic monster he seeked was there.\n\n\n \"I don't see anything suspicious,\" Splinter contributed.\n\n\n \"There's nothing special to see,\" Kerry Blane said shortly. \"As I  understand it, anyway, this chunk of animated appetite hangs around an  island shaped like a turtle. However, our orders are to investigate  every island, just in case there might be more than one of the  monsters.\"\n\n\n Splinter buckled on his dis-gun, excitement flaring in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's do a little exploring?\" he said eagerly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane shook his head, swung the cruiser north again.\n\n\n \"Plenty of time for that later,\" he said mildly. \"We'll find this  turtle-island, make a landing, and take a look around. Later, if we're  lucky enough to blow our objective to Kingdom Come, we'll do a little  exploring of the other islands.\"\n\n\n \"Hell!\" Splinter scowled in mock disgust. \"An old woman like you should  be taking in knitting for a living!\"\n\n\n \"Orders are orders!\" Kerry Blane shrugged. He swung the cruiser in a wide arc to the north, trebling the flying  speed within minutes, handling the controls with a familiar dexterity.  He said nothing, searched the gleaming ocean for the smudge of  blackness that would denote another island. His gaze flicked amusedly,  now and then, to the lanky Splinter who scowled moodily and toyed with  the dis-gun in his long hands.\n\n\n \"Cheer up, lad,\" Kerry Blane said finally. \"I think you'll find plenty  to occupy your time shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe?\" Splinter said gloomily.\n\n\n He idly swallowed another vitamin capsule, grinned, when he saw Kerry  Blane's automatic grimace of distaste. Then he yawned hugely, twisted  into a comfortable position, dozed sleepily.\n\n\n Kerry Blane rode the controls for the next three hours, searching the  limitless ocean for the few specks of islands that followed the slow  currents of the water planet. Always, there was the same misty light  surrounding the ship, never dimming, giving a sense of unreality to the  scene below. Nowhere was there the slightest sign of life until, in the  fourth hour of flight, a tiny dot of blackness came slowly over the  horizon's water line.\n\n\n Kerry Blane spun the ship in a tight circle, sent it flashing to the  west. His keen eyes lighted, when he finally made out the turtle-like  outline of the island, and he whistled softly, off-key, as he nudged  the snoring Splinter.\n\n\n \"This is it, Sleeping Beauty,\" he called. \"Snap out of it!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Whuzzat?\" Splinter grunted, rolled to his elbow.\n\n\n \"Here's the island.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\" Splinter swung his feet from the bunk, peered from the vision  port, sleepiness instantly erased from his face.\n\n\n \"Hot damn!\" he chortled. \"Now we'll see a little action!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, tried to conceal the excitement he felt. He shook  his head, his fingers flickering over the control studs.\n\n\n \"Don't get your hopes too high, lad,\" he counseled. \"With those super  Zelta guns, it won't take ten minutes to wipe out that monster.\"\n\n\n Splinter rubbed his hands together, sighed like a boy seeing his first  circus. \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal  for a year!\"\n\n\n \"Could be!\" Kerry Blane agreed.\n\n\n He peered through the port, seeking any spot clear enough for a landing  field. Except for a strip of open beach, the island was a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n\n\n \"Belt yourself,\" Kerry Blane warned. \"If that beach isn't solid, I'll  have to lift the ship in a hell of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter's fingers were all thumbs in his excitement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane set the controls for a shallow glide, his fingers moving  like a concert pianist's. The cruiser yawed slightly, settled slowly  in a flat shallow glide.\n\n\n \"We're going in,\" Kerry Blane said quietly.\n\n\n He closed a knife switch, seeing too late the vitamin capsule that was  lodged in the slot. There was the sharp splutter of a short-circuit,  and a thin tendril of smoke drifted upward.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" Kerry Blane swore briefly.\n\n\n There was an instant, terrific explosion of the stern jets, and the  cruiser hurtled toward the beach like a gravity-crazed comet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane said absolutely nothing, his breath driven from him by the  suck of inertia. His hands darted for the controls, seeking to balance  the forces that threw the ship about like a toy. He cut all rockets  with a smashing swoop of his hand, tried to fire the bow rockets. But  the short had ruined the entire control system.\n\n\n For one interminable second, he saw the uncanny uprush of the island  below. He flicked his gaze about, saw the instant terror that wiped  all other expression from his young companion's face. Then the cruiser  plowed into the silvery sand.\n\n\n Belts parted like rotten string; they were thrown forward with crushing  force against the control panel. They groped feebly for support, their  bodies twisting involuntarily, as the ship cartwheeled a dozen times in  a few seconds. Almost instantly, consciousness was battered from them.\n\n\n With one final, grinding bounce, the cruiser rolled to its side,  twisted over and over for a hundred yards, then came to a metal-ripping  stop against a moss-grown boulder at the water's edge. III\n\n\n Kerry Blane choked, tried to turn his head from the water that trickled  into his face. He opened his eyes, stared blankly, uncomprehendingly  into the bloody features of the man bending over him.\n\n\n \"What happened?\" he gasped.\n\n\n Splinter Wood laughed, almost hysterically, mopped at his forehead with  a wet handkerchief.\n\n\n \"I thought you were dead!\" he said simply.\n\n\n Kerry Blane moved his arm experimentally, felt broken bones grate in  an exquisite wave of pain. He fought back the nausea, gazed about the  cabin, realized the ship lay on its side.\n\n\n \"Maybe I am,\" he said ruefully. \"No man could live through that crash.\"\n\n\n Splinter moved away, sat down tiredly on the edge of a bunk. He shook  his head dazedly, inspected the long cut on his leg.\n\n\n \"We seem to have done it,\" he said dully.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded, clambered to his feet, favoring his broken arm.  He leaned over the control panel, inspecting the dials with a worried  gaze. Slowly, his eyes lightened, and his voice was almost cheerful as  he swung about.\n\n\n \"Everything is more or less okay,\" he said. \"The board will have to  be rewired, but nothing else seems to be damaged so that repairs are  needed.\"\n\n\n Splinter looked up from his task of bandaging his leg. \"What caused  the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next,  Blooey!\"\n\n\n Anger suddenly mottled Kerry Blane's face; he swore monotonously and  bitterly for a moment.\n\n\n \"Those gol-damned pills you been taking caused the crash!\" he roared.  \"One of them broke and shorted out the control board.\" He scowled at  the incredulous Splinter. \"By the three tails of a Martian sand-pup, I  ought to cram the rest of them down your throat, boxes and all!\"\n\n\n Splinter flushed, seemed to be fumbling for words. After a bit, Kerry  Blane grinned.\n\n\n \"Forget it, lad,\" he said more kindly, \"those things happen. Now, if  you'll bind a splint about my arm, we'll see what we can do about  righting the ship.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, opened the medical locker, worked with tape and  splints for minutes. Great beads of perspiration stood out in high  relief on Kerry Blane's forehead, but he made no sound. At last,  Splinter finished, tucked the supplies away.\n\n\n \"Now what?\" he asked subduedly.\n\n\n \"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. Can't tell but  what that protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit  in the near future!\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter unscrewed the port cogs, swung the portal back.\n\n\n He swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the  older man. After much puffing and grunting, Kerry Blane managed to  clamber through the port. They stood for a moment in silent wonder,  staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled  endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like  trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\n\n\n \"How big do you feel now?\" Kerry Blane asked quietly.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was silent, awed by the beauty and the tremendous size of  the growths on the water world.\n\n\n Kerry Blane walked the length of the cruiser, examining the slight  damage done by the crash, evaluating the situation with a practiced  gaze. He nodded slowly, retraced his steps, and stood looking at the  furrow plowed in the sand.\n\n\n \"Won't be any trouble at all to lift the ship,\" he called. \"After  rewiring the board, we'll turn the ship with an underjet, swing it  about, and head her toward the sea.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, dropped into the open port. A moment later, he flipped  a rope ladder outside, where it dangled to the ground, then climbed out  himself, carrying the two Zelta guns.\n\n\n \"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we  do go into action.\"\n\n\n He climbed down the ladder, laid the guns aside, then reached up a  hand to aid Kerry Blane's descent. Kerry Blane came down slowly and  awkwardly, jumped the last few feet. He felt surprisingly light and  strong in the lesser gravity.\n\n\n He stood, leaning against the ship, watching as Splinter picked up  the first gun and leveled it at a gigantic tree. Splinter sighted  carefully, winked at the older man, then pressed the firing stud.\n\n\n Nothing happened; there was no hissing crackle of released energy.\n\n\n Kerry Blane strode forward, puzzlement on his lined face, his hand  out-stretched toward the defective weapon. Splinter gaped at the gun in  his hands, held it out wordlessly.\n\n\n \"The crash must have broken something,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head. \"There's only one moving part,\" he said, \"and  that's the force gate on the firing stud.\"\n\n\n \"Try the other,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n \"Okay!\"\n\n\n Splinter lifted the second gun, pressed the stud, gazed white-faced at  his companion.\n\n\n \"It won't work, either,\" he said stupidly. \"I don't get it? The source  of power is limitless. Solar rays never\u2014\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane dropped the first gun to his side, swore harshly.\n\n\n \"Damn it,\" he said. \"They didn't think of it; you didn't think of it;  and I most certainly forgot! Solar rays can't penetrate the miles of  clouds on Venus.

PEACOCK The orders were explicit: \"Destroy the\n\n 'THING' of Venus.\" But Patrolmen Kerry\n\n Blane and Splinter Wood, their space-ship\n\n wrecked, could not follow orders\u2014their\n\n weapons were useless on the Water-world.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Old Kerry Blane exploded.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" he roared. \"I don't like you; and I don't like this ship;  and I don't like the assignment; and I don't like those infernal pills  you keep eating; and I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Splinter\" Wood grinned.\n\n\n \"Seems to me, Kerry,\" he remarked humorously, \"that you don't like much  of anything!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane growled unintelligibly, batted the injector lever with a  calloused hand. His grizzled hair was a stiff wiry mop on his small  head, and his oversize jaw was thrust belligerently forward. But deep  within his eyes, where he hoped it was hidden, was a friendly twinkle  that gave the lie to his speech.\n\n\n \"You're a squirt!\" he snapped disagreeably. \"You're not dry behind  the ears, yet. You're like the rest of these kids who call themselves  pilots\u2014only more so! And why the hell the chief had to sic you on me,  on an exploration trip this important\u2014well, I'll never understand.\"\n\n\n Splinter rolled his six foot three of lanky body into a more  comfortable position on the air-bunk. He yawned tremendously, fumbled a  small box from his shirt pocket, and removed a marble-like capsule.\n\n\n \"Better take one of these,\" he warned. \"You're liable to get the space  bends at any moment.\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane snorted, batted the box aside impatiently, scowled  moodily at the capsules that bounced for a moment against the pilot  room's walls before hanging motionless in the air.\n\n\n \"Mister Wood,\" he said icily, \"I was flying a space ship while they  were changing your pants twenty times a day. When I want advice on how  to fly a ship, how to cure space bends, how to handle a Zelta ray, or  how to spit\u2014I'll ask you! Until then, you and your bloody marbles can  go plumb straight to the devil!\"\n\n\n \"Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\" Splinter reached out lazily, plucked the capsules from  the air, one by one.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit one of the five allotted cigarettes of the day.\n\n\n \"Don't 'tsk' me, you young squirt,\" he grunted around a mouthful of  fragrant smoke. \"I know all the arguments you can put up; ain't that  all I been hearing for a week? You take your vitamins A, B, C, D, all  you want, but you leave me alone\u2014or I'll stuff your head down your  throat, P.D.Q.!\"\n\n\n \"All right, all right!\" Splinter tucked the capsule box back into his  pocket, grinned mockingly. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. With this  shielded ship, and with no sunlight reaching Venus' surface, you're  gonna be begging for some of my vitamin, super-concentrated pills  before we get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane made a rich, ripe noise with his mouth.\n\n\n \"Pfuii!\" he said very distinctly.\n\n\n \"Gracious!\" Splinter said in mock horror. They made a strange contrast as they lay in their air bunks. Splinter  was fully a head taller than the dour Irishman, and his lanky build  gave a false impression of awkwardness. While the vitriolic Kerry Blane  was short and compact, strength and quickness evident in every movement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane had flown every type of ship that rode in space. In the  passing years, he had flight-tested almost every new experimental ship,  had flown them with increasing skill, had earned a reputation as a  trouble shooter on any kind of craft.\n\n\n But even Kerry Blane had to retire eventually.\n\n\n A great retirement banquet had been given in his honor by the  Interplanetary Squadron. There had been the usual speeches and  presentations; and Kerry Blane had heard them all, had thanked the  donors of the gifts. But it was not until the next morning, when he was  dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in forty years, that he  realized the enormity of the thing that had happened to his life.\n\n\n Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning, shriveled and  passed away, leaving him suddenly shrunken and old. He had become like  a rusty old freighter couched between the gleaming bodies of great  space warriors.\n\n\n Finally, as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely  aside, he had taken a desk job in the squadron offices. For six years  he had dry-rotted there, waiting hopefully for the moment when his  active services would be needed again.\n\n\n It was there that he had met and liked the ungainly Splinter Wood.  There was something in the boy that had found a kindred spirit in Kerry  Blane's heart, and he had taken the youngster in hand to give him the  benefits of experience that had become legendary.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was a probationary pilot, had been admitted to the  Interplanetary Squadron because of his inherent skill, even though his  formal education had been fairly well neglected. Now, the two of them rode the pounding jets of a DX cruiser, bound  for Venus to make a personal survey of its floating islands for the  Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division.\n\n\n \"Ten to one we don't get back!\" Splinter said pessimistically.\n\n\n Kerry Blane scrubbed out his cigarette, scowled bleakly at the  instrument panel. He sensed the faint thread of fear in the youngster's  tone, and a nostalgic twinge touched his heart, for he was remembering  the days of his youth when he had a full life to look forward to.\n\n\n \"If you're afraid, you can get out and walk back,\" he snapped  disagreeably.\n\n\n A grin lifted the corners of Splinter's long mouth, spread into his  eyes. His hand unconsciously came up, touched the tiny squadron pin on  his lapel.\n\n\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, glory grabber,\" he said mockingly, \"but I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"\n\n\n \" Me! You've got orders to take care of me ?\" Kerry Blane choked  incoherently for a moment, red tiding cholerically upward from his  loosened collar.\n\n\n \"Of course!\" Splinter grinned.\n\n\n Kerry Blane exploded, words spewing volcanically forth. Splinter  relaxed, his booted foot beating out a dull rhythm to the colorful  language learned through almost fifty years of spacing. And at last,  when Kerry Blane had quieted until he but smoldered, he leaned over and  touched the old spacer on the sleeve.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight!\" he remarked pleasantly.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight what?\" Kerry Blane asked sullenly, the old twinkle  beginning to light again deep in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight new words\u2014and you swore them beautifully!\" Splinter  beamed. \"Some day you can teach them to me.\"\n\n\n They laughed then, Old Kerry Blane and young Splinter Wood, and  the warmth of their friendship was a tangible thing in the small  control-room of the cruiser.\n\n\n And in the midst of their laughter, Old Kerry Blane choked in agony,  surged desperately against his bunk straps.\n\n\n He screamed unknowingly, feeling only the horrible excruciating agony  of his body, tasting the blood that gushed from his mouth and nostrils.  His muscles were knotted cords that he could not loosen, and his blood  was a surging stream that pounded at his throbbing temples. The air he  breathed seemed to be molten flame.\n\n\n His body arced again and again against the restraining straps, and his  mouth was open in a soundless scream. He sensed dimly that his partner  had wrenched open a wall door, removed metal medicine kits, and was  fumbling through their contents. He felt the bite of the hypodermic,  felt a deadly numbness replace the raging torment that had been his  for seconds. He swallowed three capsules automatically, passed into a  coma-like sleep, woke hours later to stare clear-eyed into Splinter's  concerned face.\n\n\n \"Close, wasn't it?\" he said weakly, conversationally.\n\n\n \"Close enough!\" Splinter agreed relievedly. \"If you had followed my  advice and taken those vitamin capsules, you'd never have had the  bends.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, winced when he felt the dull ache in his body.\n\n\n \"I've had the bends before, and lived through them!\" he said, still  weakly defiant.\n\n\n \"That's the past,\" Splinter said quietly. \"This is the present, and you  take your pills every day, just as I do\u2014from now on.\"\n\n\n \"All right\u2014and thanks!\"\n\n\n \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\n A buzzer sounded from the instrument panel, and a tiny light glowed  redly.\n\n\n \"Six hours more,\" Splinter said, turned to the instrument panel.\n\n\n His long hands played over the instrument panel, checking, controlling  the rocket fire, adjusting delicate instruments to hairline marks.  Kerry Blane nodded in silent approval.\n\n\n They could feel the first tug of gravity on their bodies, and through  the vision port could see the greenish ball that was cloud-covered  Venus. Excitement lifted their spirits, brought light to their eyes as  they peered eagerly ahead.\n\n\n \"What's it really like?\" Splinter asked impatiently.\n\n\n Kerry Blane yawned, settled back luxuriously. \"I'll tell you later,\" he  said, \"I'm going to take a nap and try to ease this bellyache of mine.  Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"\n\n\n He yawned again, drifted instantly into sleep, relaxing with the  ability of a spaceman who sleeps when and if he can. Splinter smiled  down at his sleeping partner, then turned back to the quartzite port.  He shook his head a bit, remembering the stories he had heard about the  water planet, wondering\u2014wondering\u2014 II\n\n\n Venus was a fluffy cotton ball hanging motionless in bottomless  space. Far to the left, Mercury gleamed like a polished diamond in  the sunlight. Kerry Blane cut the driving rockets, let the cruiser  sink into a fast gravity-dive, guiding it only now and then by a brief  flicker of a side jet.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched breathlessly from the vision port, his long face  eager and reckless, his eyes seeking to pierce the clouds that roiled  and twisted uneasily over the surface of the planet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane glanced tolerantly at his young companion, felt a nostalgic  tug at his heart when he remembered the first time he had approached  the water-planet years before. Then, he had been a young and reckless  firebrand, his fame already spreading, an unquenchable fire of  adventure flaming in his heart.\n\n\n Now, his aged but steady fingers rested lightly on the controls,  brought the patrol cruiser closer to the cloud-banks on the line of  demarcation between the sunward and sunless sides of the planet. He  hummed tunelessly, strangely happy, as he peered ahead.\n\n\n \"Val Kenton died there,\" Splinter whispered softly, \"Died to save the  lives of three other people!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, and his voice changed subtly.  \"Val was a blackguard, a criminal; but he died in the best traditions  of the service.\" He sighed. \"He never had a chance.\"\n\n\n \"Murdered!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane smiled grimly. \"I guess I used too broad an interpretation  of the word,\" he said gently. \"Anyway, one of our main tasks is to  destroy the thing that killed him.\"\n\n\n His lean fingers tightened unconsciously.\n\n\n \"I'd like nothing better than to turn a Zelta-blaster on that chunk of  living protoplasm and cremate it.\"\n\n\n Splinters shivered slightly. \"Do you think we'll find it?\" he asked.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"I think it will find us; after all, it's just an  animated appetite looking for food.\"\n\n\n He turned back to the controls, flipped a switch, and the cutting of  the nose rocket dropped the ship in an angling glide toward the clouds  a few miles below. Gravity was full strength now, and although not as  great as Earth's, was still strong enough to bring a sense of giddiness  to the men.\n\n\n \"Here we go!\" Splinter said tonelessly.\n\n\n The great cottony batts of roiling clouds rushed up to meet the ship,  bringing the first sense of violent movement in more than a week of  flying. There was something awesome and breath-taking in the speed with  which the ship dropped toward the planet.\n\n\n Tendrils of vapor touched the ports, were whipped aside, then were  replaced by heavier fingers of cloud. Kerry Blane pressed a firing  stud, and nose rockets thrummed in a rising crescendo as the free fall  of the cruiser was checked. Heat rose in the cabin from the friction of  the outer air, then dissipated, as the force-screen voltometer leaped  higher.\n\n\n Then, as though it had never been, the sun disappeared, and there was  only a gray blankness pressing about the ship. Gone was all sense of  movement, and the ship seemed to hover in a gray nothingness.\n\n\n Kerry Blane crouched over the control panel, his hands moving deftly,  his eyes flicking from one instrument to another. Tiny lines of  concentration etched themselves about his mouth, and perspiration  beaded his forehead. He rode that cruiser through the miles of clouds  through sheer instinctive ability, seeming to fly it as though he were  an integral part of the ship.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched him with awe in his eyes, seeing for the first  time the incredible instinct that had made Kerry Blane the idol of a  billion people. He relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the  brilliant competence of his companion.\n\n\n Seconds flowed into moments, and the moments merged into one another,  and still the clouds pressed with a visible strength against the  ports. The rockets drummed steadily, holding the ship aloft, dropping  it slowly toward the planet below. Then the clouds thinned, and,  incredibly, were permeated with a dim and glowing light. A second  later, and the clouds were gone, and a thousand feet below tumbled and  tossed in a majestic display of ruthless strength an ocean that seemed  to be composed of liquid fluorescence.\n\n\n Kerry Blane heard Splinter's instant sigh of unbelief.\n\n\n \"Good Lord!\" Splinter said, \"What\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice stilled, and he was silent, his eyes drinking in the weird  incredible scene below. The ocean was a shifting, white-capped wash of silvery light that  gleamed with a bright phosphorescence of a hundred, intermingled,  kaleidoscopic colors. And the unreal, unearthly light continued  unbroken everywhere, reflected from the low-hanging clouds, reaching  to the far horizon, bathing every detail of the planet in a brilliance  more bright than moonlight.\n\n\n Splinter turned a wondering face. \"But the official reports say that  there is no light on Venus,\" he exclaimed. \"That was one of the reasons  given when exploration was forbidden!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"That was merely a pretext to keep foolhardy  spacemen from losing their lives on the planet. In reality, the  ocean is alive with an incredibly tiny marine worm that glows  phosphorescently. The light generated from those billions of worms is  reflected back from the clouds, makes Venus eternally lighted.\"\n\n\n He turned the ship to the North, relaxed a bit on the air bunk. He  felt tired and worn, his body aching from the space bends of a few  hours before.\n\n\n \"Take over,\" he said wearily. \"Take the ship North, and watch for any  island.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, rested his long hands on the controls. The space  cruiser lifted a bit in a sudden spurt of speed, and the rocket-sound  was a solid thrum of unleashed power.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit a cigarette, leaned toward a vision port. He felt again  that thrill he had experienced when he had first flashed his single-man  cruiser through the clouds years before. Then the breath caught in his  throat, and he tapped his companion's arm.\n\n\n \"Take a look!\" he called excitedly.\n\n\n They fought in the ocean below, fought in a never-ending splashing of  what seemed to be liquid fire. It was like watching a tri-dim screen of  a news event, except for the utter lack of sound.\n\n\n One was scaly, while the other was skinned, and both were fully three  hundred feet long. Great scimitars of teeth flashed in the light, and  blood gouted and stained the water crimson whenever a slashing blow was  struck. They threshed in a mad paroxysm of rage, whirling and spinning  in the phosphorescent water like beings from a nightmare, exploding  out of their element time and again, only to fall back in a gargantuan  spray of fluorescence.\n\n\n And then the scaly monster flashed in a half-turn, drove forward with  jaws agape, wrenched and ripped at the smooth black throat of the other  creature. The second creature rippled and undulated in agony, whipping  the ocean to foam, then went limp. The victorious monster circled the  body of its dead foe, then, majestically, plunged from sight into the  ocean's depths. An instant later, the water frothed, as hundreds of  lesser marine monsters attacked and fed on the floating corpse.\n\n\n \"Brrrr!\" Splinter shivered in sudden horror.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled dryly. \"Feel like going for a swim?\" he asked  conversationally.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head, watched the scene disappear from view to the  rear of the line of flight, then sank back onto his bunk.\n\n\n \"Not me!\" he said deprecatingly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled again, swung the cruiser toward the tiny smudge of  black on the horizon. Glowing water flashed beneath the ship, seeming  to smooth into a gleaming mirror shot with dancing colors. There was no  sign of life anywhere.\n\n\n Thirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island that floated  free in the phosphorescent ocean. His keen eyes searched the tangled  luxuriant growth of the jungle below, searching for some indication  that the protoplasmic monster he seeked was there.\n\n\n \"I don't see anything suspicious,\" Splinter contributed.\n\n\n \"There's nothing special to see,\" Kerry Blane said shortly. \"As I  understand it, anyway, this chunk of animated appetite hangs around an  island shaped like a turtle. However, our orders are to investigate  every island, just in case there might be more than one of the  monsters.\"\n\n\n Splinter buckled on his dis-gun, excitement flaring in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's do a little exploring?\" he said eagerly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane shook his head, swung the cruiser north again.\n\n\n \"Plenty of time for that later,\" he said mildly. \"We'll find this  turtle-island, make a landing, and take a look around. Later, if we're  lucky enough to blow our objective to Kingdom Come, we'll do a little  exploring of the other islands.\"\n\n\n \"Hell!\" Splinter scowled in mock disgust. \"An old woman like you should  be taking in knitting for a living!\"\n\n\n \"Orders are orders!\" Kerry Blane shrugged. He swung the cruiser in a wide arc to the north, trebling the flying  speed within minutes, handling the controls with a familiar dexterity.  He said nothing, searched the gleaming ocean for the smudge of  blackness that would denote another island. His gaze flicked amusedly,  now and then, to the lanky Splinter who scowled moodily and toyed with  the dis-gun in his long hands.\n\n\n \"Cheer up, lad,\" Kerry Blane said finally. \"I think you'll find plenty  to occupy your time shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe?\" Splinter said gloomily.\n\n\n He idly swallowed another vitamin capsule, grinned, when he saw Kerry  Blane's automatic grimace of distaste. Then he yawned hugely, twisted  into a comfortable position, dozed sleepily.\n\n\n Kerry Blane rode the controls for the next three hours, searching the  limitless ocean for the few specks of islands that followed the slow  currents of the water planet. Always, there was the same misty light  surrounding the ship, never dimming, giving a sense of unreality to the  scene below. Nowhere was there the slightest sign of life until, in the  fourth hour of flight, a tiny dot of blackness came slowly over the  horizon's water line.\n\n\n Kerry Blane spun the ship in a tight circle, sent it flashing to the  west. His keen eyes lighted, when he finally made out the turtle-like  outline of the island, and he whistled softly, off-key, as he nudged  the snoring Splinter.\n\n\n \"This is it, Sleeping Beauty,\" he called. \"Snap out of it!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Whuzzat?\" Splinter grunted, rolled to his elbow.\n\n\n \"Here's the island.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\" Splinter swung his feet from the bunk, peered from the vision  port, sleepiness instantly erased from his face.\n\n\n \"Hot damn!\" he chortled. \"Now we'll see a little action!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, tried to conceal the excitement he felt. He shook  his head, his fingers flickering over the control studs.\n\n\n \"Don't get your hopes too high, lad,\" he counseled. \"With those super  Zelta guns, it won't take ten minutes to wipe out that monster.\"\n\n\n Splinter rubbed his hands together, sighed like a boy seeing his first  circus. \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal  for a year!\"\n\n\n \"Could be!\" Kerry Blane agreed.\n\n\n He peered through the port, seeking any spot clear enough for a landing  field. Except for a strip of open beach, the island was a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n\n\n \"Belt yourself,\" Kerry Blane warned. \"If that beach isn't solid, I'll  have to lift the ship in a hell of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter's fingers were all thumbs in his excitement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane set the controls for a shallow glide, his fingers moving  like a concert pianist's. The cruiser yawed slightly, settled slowly  in a flat shallow glide.\n\n\n \"We're going in,\" Kerry Blane said quietly.\n\n\n He closed a knife switch, seeing too late the vitamin capsule that was  lodged in the slot. There was the sharp splutter of a short-circuit,  and a thin tendril of smoke drifted upward.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" Kerry Blane swore briefly.\n\n\n There was an instant, terrific explosion of the stern jets, and the  cruiser hurtled toward the beach like a gravity-crazed comet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane said absolutely nothing, his breath driven from him by the  suck of inertia. His hands darted for the controls, seeking to balance  the forces that threw the ship about like a toy. He cut all rockets  with a smashing swoop of his hand, tried to fire the bow rockets. But  the short had ruined the entire control system.\n\n\n For one interminable second, he saw the uncanny uprush of the island  below. He flicked his gaze about, saw the instant terror that wiped  all other expression from his young companion's face. Then the cruiser  plowed into the silvery sand.\n\n\n Belts parted like rotten string; they were thrown forward with crushing  force against the control panel. They groped feebly for support, their  bodies twisting involuntarily, as the ship cartwheeled a dozen times in  a few seconds. Almost instantly, consciousness was battered from them.\n\n\n With one final, grinding bounce, the cruiser rolled to its side,  twisted over and over for a hundred yards, then came to a metal-ripping  stop against a moss-grown boulder at the water's edge. III\n\n\n Kerry Blane choked, tried to turn his head from the water that trickled  into his face. He opened his eyes, stared blankly, uncomprehendingly  into the bloody features of the man bending over him.\n\n\n \"What happened?\" he gasped.\n\n\n Splinter Wood laughed, almost hysterically, mopped at his forehead with  a wet handkerchief.\n\n\n \"I thought you were dead!\" he said simply.\n\n\n Kerry Blane moved his arm experimentally, felt broken bones grate in  an exquisite wave of pain. He fought back the nausea, gazed about the  cabin, realized the ship lay on its side.\n\n\n \"Maybe I am,\" he said ruefully. \"No man could live through that crash.\"\n\n\n Splinter moved away, sat down tiredly on the edge of a bunk. He shook  his head dazedly, inspected the long cut on his leg.\n\n\n \"We seem to have done it,\" he said dully.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded, clambered to his feet, favoring his broken arm.  He leaned over the control panel, inspecting the dials with a worried  gaze. Slowly, his eyes lightened, and his voice was almost cheerful as  he swung about.\n\n\n \"Everything is more or less okay,\" he said. \"The board will have to  be rewired, but nothing else seems to be damaged so that repairs are  needed.\"\n\n\n Splinter looked up from his task of bandaging his leg. \"What caused  the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next,  Blooey!\"\n\n\n Anger suddenly mottled Kerry Blane's face; he swore monotonously and  bitterly for a moment.\n\n\n \"Those gol-damned pills you been taking caused the crash!\" he roared.  \"One of them broke and shorted out the control board.\" He scowled at  the incredulous Splinter. \"By the three tails of a Martian sand-pup, I  ought to cram the rest of them down your throat, boxes and all!\"\n\n\n Splinter flushed, seemed to be fumbling for words. After a bit, Kerry  Blane grinned.\n\n\n \"Forget it, lad,\" he said more kindly, \"those things happen. Now, if  you'll bind a splint about my arm, we'll see what we can do about  righting the ship.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, opened the medical locker, worked with tape and  splints for minutes. Great beads of perspiration stood out in high  relief on Kerry Blane's forehead, but he made no sound. At last,  Splinter finished, tucked the supplies away.\n\n\n \"Now what?\" he asked subduedly.\n\n\n \"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. Can't tell but  what that protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit  in the near future!\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter unscrewed the port cogs, swung the portal back.\n\n\n He swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the  older man. After much puffing and grunting, Kerry Blane managed to  clamber through the port. They stood for a moment in silent wonder,  staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled  endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like  trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\n\n\n \"How big do you feel now?\" Kerry Blane asked quietly.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was silent, awed by the beauty and the tremendous size of  the growths on the water world.\n\n\n Kerry Blane walked the length of the cruiser, examining the slight  damage done by the crash, evaluating the situation with a practiced  gaze. He nodded slowly, retraced his steps, and stood looking at the  furrow plowed in the sand.\n\n\n \"Won't be any trouble at all to lift the ship,\" he called. \"After  rewiring the board, we'll turn the ship with an underjet, swing it  about, and head her toward the sea.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, dropped into the open port. A moment later, he flipped  a rope ladder outside, where it dangled to the ground, then climbed out  himself, carrying the two Zelta guns.\n\n\n \"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we  do go into action.\"\n\n\n He climbed down the ladder, laid the guns aside, then reached up a  hand to aid Kerry Blane's descent. Kerry Blane came down slowly and  awkwardly, jumped the last few feet. He felt surprisingly light and  strong in the lesser gravity.\n\n\n He stood, leaning against the ship, watching as Splinter picked up  the first gun and leveled it at a gigantic tree. Splinter sighted  carefully, winked at the older man, then pressed the firing stud.\n\n\n Nothing happened; there was no hissing crackle of released energy.\n\n\n Kerry Blane strode forward, puzzlement on his lined face, his hand  out-stretched toward the defective weapon. Splinter gaped at the gun in  his hands, held it out wordlessly.\n\n\n \"The crash must have broken something,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head. \"There's only one moving part,\" he said, \"and  that's the force gate on the firing stud.\"\n\n\n \"Try the other,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n \"Okay!\"\n\n\n Splinter lifted the second gun, pressed the stud, gazed white-faced at  his companion.\n\n\n \"It won't work, either,\" he said stupidly. \"I don't get it? The source  of power is limitless. Solar rays never\u2014\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane dropped the first gun to his side, swore harshly.\n\n\n \"Damn it,\" he said. \"They didn't think of it; you didn't think of it;  and I most certainly forgot! Solar rays can't penetrate the miles of  clouds on Venus. Those guns are utterly useless as weapons!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Splinter feel about being with Kerry on the turtle-shaped island?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Pitiful that he had broken his arm\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Relieved to have his experience at hand\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Relieved to have his experience at hand\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Relieved to have his experience at hand\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cPitiful that he had broken his arm\u201d  (Debater_B\u2019s Position) 1.

PEACOCK The orders were explicit: \"Destroy the\n\n 'THING' of Venus.\" But Patrolmen Kerry\n\n Blane and Splinter Wood, their space-ship\n\n wrecked, could not follow orders\u2014their\n\n weapons were useless on the Water-world.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Old Kerry Blane exploded.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" he roared. \"I don't like you; and I don't like this ship;  and I don't like the assignment; and I don't like those infernal pills  you keep eating; and I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Splinter\" Wood grinned.\n\n\n \"Seems to me, Kerry,\" he remarked humorously, \"that you don't like much  of anything!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane growled unintelligibly, batted the injector lever with a  calloused hand. His grizzled hair was a stiff wiry mop on his small  head, and his oversize jaw was thrust belligerently forward. But deep  within his eyes, where he hoped it was hidden, was a friendly twinkle  that gave the lie to his speech.\n\n\n \"You're a squirt!\" he snapped disagreeably. \"You're not dry behind  the ears, yet. You're like the rest of these kids who call themselves  pilots\u2014only more so! And why the hell the chief had to sic you on me,  on an exploration trip this important\u2014well, I'll never understand.\"\n\n\n Splinter rolled his six foot three of lanky body into a more  comfortable position on the air-bunk. He yawned tremendously, fumbled a  small box from his shirt pocket, and removed a marble-like capsule.\n\n\n \"Better take one of these,\" he warned. \"You're liable to get the space  bends at any moment.\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane snorted, batted the box aside impatiently, scowled  moodily at the capsules that bounced for a moment against the pilot  room's walls before hanging motionless in the air.\n\n\n \"Mister Wood,\" he said icily, \"I was flying a space ship while they  were changing your pants twenty times a day. When I want advice on how  to fly a ship, how to cure space bends, how to handle a Zelta ray, or  how to spit\u2014I'll ask you! Until then, you and your bloody marbles can  go plumb straight to the devil!\"\n\n\n \"Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\" Splinter reached out lazily, plucked the capsules from  the air, one by one.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit one of the five allotted cigarettes of the day.\n\n\n \"Don't 'tsk' me, you young squirt,\" he grunted around a mouthful of  fragrant smoke. \"I know all the arguments you can put up; ain't that  all I been hearing for a week? You take your vitamins A, B, C, D, all  you want, but you leave me alone\u2014or I'll stuff your head down your  throat, P.D.Q.!\"\n\n\n \"All right, all right!\" Splinter tucked the capsule box back into his  pocket, grinned mockingly. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. With this  shielded ship, and with no sunlight reaching Venus' surface, you're  gonna be begging for some of my vitamin, super-concentrated pills  before we get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane made a rich, ripe noise with his mouth.\n\n\n \"Pfuii!\" he said very distinctly.\n\n\n \"Gracious!\" Splinter said in mock horror. They made a strange contrast as they lay in their air bunks. Splinter  was fully a head taller than the dour Irishman, and his lanky build  gave a false impression of awkwardness. While the vitriolic Kerry Blane  was short and compact, strength and quickness evident in every movement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane had flown every type of ship that rode in space. In the  passing years, he had flight-tested almost every new experimental ship,  had flown them with increasing skill, had earned a reputation as a  trouble shooter on any kind of craft.\n\n\n But even Kerry Blane had to retire eventually.\n\n\n A great retirement banquet had been given in his honor by the  Interplanetary Squadron. There had been the usual speeches and  presentations; and Kerry Blane had heard them all, had thanked the  donors of the gifts. But it was not until the next morning, when he was  dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in forty years, that he  realized the enormity of the thing that had happened to his life.\n\n\n Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning, shriveled and  passed away, leaving him suddenly shrunken and old. He had become like  a rusty old freighter couched between the gleaming bodies of great  space warriors.\n\n\n Finally, as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely  aside, he had taken a desk job in the squadron offices. For six years  he had dry-rotted there, waiting hopefully for the moment when his  active services would be needed again.\n\n\n It was there that he had met and liked the ungainly Splinter Wood.  There was something in the boy that had found a kindred spirit in Kerry  Blane's heart, and he had taken the youngster in hand to give him the  benefits of experience that had become legendary.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was a probationary pilot, had been admitted to the  Interplanetary Squadron because of his inherent skill, even though his  formal education had been fairly well neglected. Now, the two of them rode the pounding jets of a DX cruiser, bound  for Venus to make a personal survey of its floating islands for the  Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division.\n\n\n \"Ten to one we don't get back!\" Splinter said pessimistically.\n\n\n Kerry Blane scrubbed out his cigarette, scowled bleakly at the  instrument panel. He sensed the faint thread of fear in the youngster's  tone, and a nostalgic twinge touched his heart, for he was remembering  the days of his youth when he had a full life to look forward to.\n\n\n \"If you're afraid, you can get out and walk back,\" he snapped  disagreeably.\n\n\n A grin lifted the corners of Splinter's long mouth, spread into his  eyes. His hand unconsciously came up, touched the tiny squadron pin on  his lapel.\n\n\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, glory grabber,\" he said mockingly, \"but I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"\n\n\n \" Me! You've got orders to take care of me ?\" Kerry Blane choked  incoherently for a moment, red tiding cholerically upward from his  loosened collar.\n\n\n \"Of course!\" Splinter grinned.\n\n\n Kerry Blane exploded, words spewing volcanically forth. Splinter  relaxed, his booted foot beating out a dull rhythm to the colorful  language learned through almost fifty years of spacing. And at last,  when Kerry Blane had quieted until he but smoldered, he leaned over and  touched the old spacer on the sleeve.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight!\" he remarked pleasantly.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight what?\" Kerry Blane asked sullenly, the old twinkle  beginning to light again deep in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight new words\u2014and you swore them beautifully!\" Splinter  beamed. \"Some day you can teach them to me.\"\n\n\n They laughed then, Old Kerry Blane and young Splinter Wood, and  the warmth of their friendship was a tangible thing in the small  control-room of the cruiser.\n\n\n And in the midst of their laughter, Old Kerry Blane choked in agony,  surged desperately against his bunk straps.\n\n\n He screamed unknowingly, feeling only the horrible excruciating agony  of his body, tasting the blood that gushed from his mouth and nostrils.  His muscles were knotted cords that he could not loosen, and his blood  was a surging stream that pounded at his throbbing temples. The air he  breathed seemed to be molten flame.\n\n\n His body arced again and again against the restraining straps, and his  mouth was open in a soundless scream. He sensed dimly that his partner  had wrenched open a wall door, removed metal medicine kits, and was  fumbling through their contents. He felt the bite of the hypodermic,  felt a deadly numbness replace the raging torment that had been his  for seconds. He swallowed three capsules automatically, passed into a  coma-like sleep, woke hours later to stare clear-eyed into Splinter's  concerned face.\n\n\n \"Close, wasn't it?\" he said weakly, conversationally.\n\n\n \"Close enough!\" Splinter agreed relievedly. \"If you had followed my  advice and taken those vitamin capsules, you'd never have had the  bends.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, winced when he felt the dull ache in his body.\n\n\n \"I've had the bends before, and lived through them!\" he said, still  weakly defiant.\n\n\n \"That's the past,\" Splinter said quietly. \"This is the present, and you  take your pills every day, just as I do\u2014from now on.\"\n\n\n \"All right\u2014and thanks!\"\n\n\n \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\n A buzzer sounded from the instrument panel, and a tiny light glowed  redly.\n\n\n \"Six hours more,\" Splinter said, turned to the instrument panel.\n\n\n His long hands played over the instrument panel, checking, controlling  the rocket fire, adjusting delicate instruments to hairline marks.  Kerry Blane nodded in silent approval.\n\n\n They could feel the first tug of gravity on their bodies, and through  the vision port could see the greenish ball that was cloud-covered  Venus. Excitement lifted their spirits, brought light to their eyes as  they peered eagerly ahead.\n\n\n \"What's it really like?\" Splinter asked impatiently.\n\n\n Kerry Blane yawned, settled back luxuriously. \"I'll tell you later,\" he  said, \"I'm going to take a nap and try to ease this bellyache of mine.  Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"\n\n\n He yawned again, drifted instantly into sleep, relaxing with the  ability of a spaceman who sleeps when and if he can. Splinter smiled  down at his sleeping partner, then turned back to the quartzite port.  He shook his head a bit, remembering the stories he had heard about the  water planet, wondering\u2014wondering\u2014 II\n\n\n Venus was a fluffy cotton ball hanging motionless in bottomless  space. Far to the left, Mercury gleamed like a polished diamond in  the sunlight. Kerry Blane cut the driving rockets, let the cruiser  sink into a fast gravity-dive, guiding it only now and then by a brief  flicker of a side jet.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched breathlessly from the vision port, his long face  eager and reckless, his eyes seeking to pierce the clouds that roiled  and twisted uneasily over the surface of the planet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane glanced tolerantly at his young companion, felt a nostalgic  tug at his heart when he remembered the first time he had approached  the water-planet years before. Then, he had been a young and reckless  firebrand, his fame already spreading, an unquenchable fire of  adventure flaming in his heart.\n\n\n Now, his aged but steady fingers rested lightly on the controls,  brought the patrol cruiser closer to the cloud-banks on the line of  demarcation between the sunward and sunless sides of the planet. He  hummed tunelessly, strangely happy, as he peered ahead.\n\n\n \"Val Kenton died there,\" Splinter whispered softly, \"Died to save the  lives of three other people!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, and his voice changed subtly.  \"Val was a blackguard, a criminal; but he died in the best traditions  of the service.\" He sighed. \"He never had a chance.\"\n\n\n \"Murdered!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane smiled grimly. \"I guess I used too broad an interpretation  of the word,\" he said gently. \"Anyway, one of our main tasks is to  destroy the thing that killed him.\"\n\n\n His lean fingers tightened unconsciously.\n\n\n \"I'd like nothing better than to turn a Zelta-blaster on that chunk of  living protoplasm and cremate it.\"\n\n\n Splinters shivered slightly. \"Do you think we'll find it?\" he asked.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"I think it will find us; after all, it's just an  animated appetite looking for food.\"\n\n\n He turned back to the controls, flipped a switch, and the cutting of  the nose rocket dropped the ship in an angling glide toward the clouds  a few miles below. Gravity was full strength now, and although not as  great as Earth's, was still strong enough to bring a sense of giddiness  to the men.\n\n\n \"Here we go!\" Splinter said tonelessly.\n\n\n The great cottony batts of roiling clouds rushed up to meet the ship,  bringing the first sense of violent movement in more than a week of  flying. There was something awesome and breath-taking in the speed with  which the ship dropped toward the planet.\n\n\n Tendrils of vapor touched the ports, were whipped aside, then were  replaced by heavier fingers of cloud. Kerry Blane pressed a firing  stud, and nose rockets thrummed in a rising crescendo as the free fall  of the cruiser was checked. Heat rose in the cabin from the friction of  the outer air, then dissipated, as the force-screen voltometer leaped  higher.\n\n\n Then, as though it had never been, the sun disappeared, and there was  only a gray blankness pressing about the ship. Gone was all sense of  movement, and the ship seemed to hover in a gray nothingness.\n\n\n Kerry Blane crouched over the control panel, his hands moving deftly,  his eyes flicking from one instrument to another. Tiny lines of  concentration etched themselves about his mouth, and perspiration  beaded his forehead. He rode that cruiser through the miles of clouds  through sheer instinctive ability, seeming to fly it as though he were  an integral part of the ship.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched him with awe in his eyes, seeing for the first  time the incredible instinct that had made Kerry Blane the idol of a  billion people. He relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the  brilliant competence of his companion.\n\n\n Seconds flowed into moments, and the moments merged into one another,  and still the clouds pressed with a visible strength against the  ports. The rockets drummed steadily, holding the ship aloft, dropping  it slowly toward the planet below. Then the clouds thinned, and,  incredibly, were permeated with a dim and glowing light. A second  later, and the clouds were gone, and a thousand feet below tumbled and  tossed in a majestic display of ruthless strength an ocean that seemed  to be composed of liquid fluorescence.\n\n\n Kerry Blane heard Splinter's instant sigh of unbelief.\n\n\n \"Good Lord!\" Splinter said, \"What\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice stilled, and he was silent, his eyes drinking in the weird  incredible scene below. The ocean was a shifting, white-capped wash of silvery light that  gleamed with a bright phosphorescence of a hundred, intermingled,  kaleidoscopic colors. And the unreal, unearthly light continued  unbroken everywhere, reflected from the low-hanging clouds, reaching  to the far horizon, bathing every detail of the planet in a brilliance  more bright than moonlight.\n\n\n Splinter turned a wondering face. \"But the official reports say that  there is no light on Venus,\" he exclaimed. \"That was one of the reasons  given when exploration was forbidden!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"That was merely a pretext to keep foolhardy  spacemen from losing their lives on the planet. In reality, the  ocean is alive with an incredibly tiny marine worm that glows  phosphorescently. The light generated from those billions of worms is  reflected back from the clouds, makes Venus eternally lighted.\"\n\n\n He turned the ship to the North, relaxed a bit on the air bunk. He  felt tired and worn, his body aching from the space bends of a few  hours before.\n\n\n \"Take over,\" he said wearily. \"Take the ship North, and watch for any  island.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, rested his long hands on the controls. The space  cruiser lifted a bit in a sudden spurt of speed, and the rocket-sound  was a solid thrum of unleashed power.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit a cigarette, leaned toward a vision port. He felt again  that thrill he had experienced when he had first flashed his single-man  cruiser through the clouds years before. Then the breath caught in his  throat, and he tapped his companion's arm.\n\n\n \"Take a look!\" he called excitedly.\n\n\n They fought in the ocean below, fought in a never-ending splashing of  what seemed to be liquid fire. It was like watching a tri-dim screen of  a news event, except for the utter lack of sound.\n\n\n One was scaly, while the other was skinned, and both were fully three  hundred feet long. Great scimitars of teeth flashed in the light, and  blood gouted and stained the water crimson whenever a slashing blow was  struck. They threshed in a mad paroxysm of rage, whirling and spinning  in the phosphorescent water like beings from a nightmare, exploding  out of their element time and again, only to fall back in a gargantuan  spray of fluorescence.\n\n\n And then the scaly monster flashed in a half-turn, drove forward with  jaws agape, wrenched and ripped at the smooth black throat of the other  creature. The second creature rippled and undulated in agony, whipping  the ocean to foam, then went limp. The victorious monster circled the  body of its dead foe, then, majestically, plunged from sight into the  ocean's depths. An instant later, the water frothed, as hundreds of  lesser marine monsters attacked and fed on the floating corpse.\n\n\n \"Brrrr!\" Splinter shivered in sudden horror.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled dryly. \"Feel like going for a swim?\" he asked  conversationally.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head, watched the scene disappear from view to the  rear of the line of flight, then sank back onto his bunk.\n\n\n \"Not me!\" he said deprecatingly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled again, swung the cruiser toward the tiny smudge of  black on the horizon. Glowing water flashed beneath the ship, seeming  to smooth into a gleaming mirror shot with dancing colors. There was no  sign of life anywhere.\n\n\n Thirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island that floated  free in the phosphorescent ocean. His keen eyes searched the tangled  luxuriant growth of the jungle below, searching for some indication  that the protoplasmic monster he seeked was there.\n\n\n \"I don't see anything suspicious,\" Splinter contributed.\n\n\n \"There's nothing special to see,\" Kerry Blane said shortly. \"As I  understand it, anyway, this chunk of animated appetite hangs around an  island shaped like a turtle. However, our orders are to investigate  every island, just in case there might be more than one of the  monsters.\"\n\n\n Splinter buckled on his dis-gun, excitement flaring in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's do a little exploring?\" he said eagerly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane shook his head, swung the cruiser north again.\n\n\n \"Plenty of time for that later,\" he said mildly. \"We'll find this  turtle-island, make a landing, and take a look around. Later, if we're  lucky enough to blow our objective to Kingdom Come, we'll do a little  exploring of the other islands.\"\n\n\n \"Hell!\" Splinter scowled in mock disgust. \"An old woman like you should  be taking in knitting for a living!\"\n\n\n \"Orders are orders!\" Kerry Blane shrugged. He swung the cruiser in a wide arc to the north, trebling the flying  speed within minutes, handling the controls with a familiar dexterity.  He said nothing, searched the gleaming ocean for the smudge of  blackness that would denote another island. His gaze flicked amusedly,  now and then, to the lanky Splinter who scowled moodily and toyed with  the dis-gun in his long hands.\n\n\n \"Cheer up, lad,\" Kerry Blane said finally. \"I think you'll find plenty  to occupy your time shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe?\" Splinter said gloomily.\n\n\n He idly swallowed another vitamin capsule, grinned, when he saw Kerry  Blane's automatic grimace of distaste. Then he yawned hugely, twisted  into a comfortable position, dozed sleepily.\n\n\n Kerry Blane rode the controls for the next three hours, searching the  limitless ocean for the few specks of islands that followed the slow  currents of the water planet. Always, there was the same misty light  surrounding the ship, never dimming, giving a sense of unreality to the  scene below. Nowhere was there the slightest sign of life until, in the  fourth hour of flight, a tiny dot of blackness came slowly over the  horizon's water line.\n\n\n Kerry Blane spun the ship in a tight circle, sent it flashing to the  west. His keen eyes lighted, when he finally made out the turtle-like  outline of the island, and he whistled softly, off-key, as he nudged  the snoring Splinter.\n\n\n \"This is it, Sleeping Beauty,\" he called. \"Snap out of it!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Whuzzat?\" Splinter grunted, rolled to his elbow.\n\n\n \"Here's the island.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\" Splinter swung his feet from the bunk, peered from the vision  port, sleepiness instantly erased from his face.\n\n\n \"Hot damn!\" he chortled. \"Now we'll see a little action!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, tried to conceal the excitement he felt. He shook  his head, his fingers flickering over the control studs.\n\n\n \"Don't get your hopes too high, lad,\" he counseled. \"With those super  Zelta guns, it won't take ten minutes to wipe out that monster.\"\n\n\n Splinter rubbed his hands together, sighed like a boy seeing his first  circus. \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal  for a year!\"\n\n\n \"Could be!\" Kerry Blane agreed.\n\n\n He peered through the port, seeking any spot clear enough for a landing  field. Except for a strip of open beach, the island was a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n\n\n \"Belt yourself,\" Kerry Blane warned. \"If that beach isn't solid, I'll  have to lift the ship in a hell of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter's fingers were all thumbs in his excitement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane set the controls for a shallow glide, his fingers moving  like a concert pianist's. The cruiser yawed slightly, settled slowly  in a flat shallow glide.\n\n\n \"We're going in,\" Kerry Blane said quietly.\n\n\n He closed a knife switch, seeing too late the vitamin capsule that was  lodged in the slot. There was the sharp splutter of a short-circuit,  and a thin tendril of smoke drifted upward.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" Kerry Blane swore briefly.\n\n\n There was an instant, terrific explosion of the stern jets, and the  cruiser hurtled toward the beach like a gravity-crazed comet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane said absolutely nothing, his breath driven from him by the  suck of inertia. His hands darted for the controls, seeking to balance  the forces that threw the ship about like a toy. He cut all rockets  with a smashing swoop of his hand, tried to fire the bow rockets. But  the short had ruined the entire control system.\n\n\n For one interminable second, he saw the uncanny uprush of the island  below. He flicked his gaze about, saw the instant terror that wiped  all other expression from his young companion's face. Then the cruiser  plowed into the silvery sand.\n\n\n Belts parted like rotten string; they were thrown forward with crushing  force against the control panel. They groped feebly for support, their  bodies twisting involuntarily, as the ship cartwheeled a dozen times in  a few seconds. Almost instantly, consciousness was battered from them.\n\n\n With one final, grinding bounce, the cruiser rolled to its side,  twisted over and over for a hundred yards, then came to a metal-ripping  stop against a moss-grown boulder at the water's edge. III\n\n\n Kerry Blane choked, tried to turn his head from the water that trickled  into his face. He opened his eyes, stared blankly, uncomprehendingly  into the bloody features of the man bending over him.\n\n\n \"What happened?\" he gasped.\n\n\n Splinter Wood laughed, almost hysterically, mopped at his forehead with  a wet handkerchief.\n\n\n \"I thought you were dead!\" he said simply.\n\n\n Kerry Blane moved his arm experimentally, felt broken bones grate in  an exquisite wave of pain. He fought back the nausea, gazed about the  cabin, realized the ship lay on its side.\n\n\n \"Maybe I am,\" he said ruefully. \"No man could live through that crash.\"\n\n\n Splinter moved away, sat down tiredly on the edge of a bunk. He shook  his head dazedly, inspected the long cut on his leg.\n\n\n \"We seem to have done it,\" he said dully.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded, clambered to his feet, favoring his broken arm.  He leaned over the control panel, inspecting the dials with a worried  gaze. Slowly, his eyes lightened, and his voice was almost cheerful as  he swung about.\n\n\n \"Everything is more or less okay,\" he said. \"The board will have to  be rewired, but nothing else seems to be damaged so that repairs are  needed.\"\n\n\n Splinter looked up from his task of bandaging his leg. \"What caused  the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next,  Blooey!\"\n\n\n Anger suddenly mottled Kerry Blane's face; he swore monotonously and  bitterly for a moment.\n\n\n \"Those gol-damned pills you been taking caused the crash!\" he roared.  \"One of them broke and shorted out the control board.\" He scowled at  the incredulous Splinter. \"By the three tails of a Martian sand-pup, I  ought to cram the rest of them down your throat, boxes and all!\"\n\n\n Splinter flushed, seemed to be fumbling for words. After a bit, Kerry  Blane grinned.\n\n\n \"Forget it, lad,\" he said more kindly, \"those things happen. Now, if  you'll bind a splint about my arm, we'll see what we can do about  righting the ship.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, opened the medical locker, worked with tape and  splints for minutes. Great beads of perspiration stood out in high  relief on Kerry Blane's forehead, but he made no sound. At last,  Splinter finished, tucked the supplies away.\n\n\n \"Now what?\" he asked subduedly.\n\n\n \"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. Can't tell but  what that protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit  in the near future!\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter unscrewed the port cogs, swung the portal back.\n\n\n He swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the  older man. After much puffing and grunting, Kerry Blane managed to  clamber through the port. They stood for a moment in silent wonder,  staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled  endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like  trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\n\n\n \"How big do you feel now?\" Kerry Blane asked quietly.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was silent, awed by the beauty and the tremendous size of  the growths on the water world.\n\n\n Kerry Blane walked the length of the cruiser, examining the slight  damage done by the crash, evaluating the situation with a practiced  gaze. He nodded slowly, retraced his steps, and stood looking at the  furrow plowed in the sand.\n\n\n \"Won't be any trouble at all to lift the ship,\" he called. \"After  rewiring the board, we'll turn the ship with an underjet, swing it  about, and head her toward the sea.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, dropped into the open port. A moment later, he flipped  a rope ladder outside, where it dangled to the ground, then climbed out  himself, carrying the two Zelta guns.\n\n\n \"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we  do go into action.\"\n\n\n He climbed down the ladder, laid the guns aside, then reached up a  hand to aid Kerry Blane's descent. Kerry Blane came down slowly and  awkwardly, jumped the last few feet. He felt surprisingly light and  strong in the lesser gravity.\n\n\n He stood, leaning against the ship, watching as Splinter picked up  the first gun and leveled it at a gigantic tree. Splinter sighted  carefully, winked at the older man, then pressed the firing stud.\n\n\n Nothing happened; there was no hissing crackle of released energy.\n\n\n Kerry Blane strode forward, puzzlement on his lined face, his hand  out-stretched toward the defective weapon. Splinter gaped at the gun in  his hands, held it out wordlessly.\n\n\n \"The crash must have broken something,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head. \"There's only one moving part,\" he said, \"and  that's the force gate on the firing stud.\"\n\n\n \"Try the other,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n \"Okay!\"\n\n\n Splinter lifted the second gun, pressed the stud, gazed white-faced at  his companion.\n\n\n \"It won't work, either,\" he said stupidly. \"I don't get it? The source  of power is limitless. Solar rays never\u2014\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane dropped the first gun to his side, swore harshly.\n\n\n \"Damn it,\" he said. \"They didn't think of it; you didn't think of it;  and I most certainly forgot! Solar rays can't penetrate the miles of  clouds on Venus.

Textual Emphasis on Orders \u201cto Take Care of You\u201d Implies Partnership  \n  \u2022 Quote: <quote>\u201cI\u2019ve got definite orders to take care of you.\u201d</quote> (I)  \n    \u2013 \u201cTake care of\u201d implies safeguarding so that Kerry\u2019s expertise remains available to accomplish the mission. Splinter\u2019s primary duty is mutual: protect the experienced spacer who is essential to their survival and to destroying the \u201cTHING.\u201d  \n    \u2013 Splinter\u2019s respect for that order highlights his dependence on Kerry\u2019s \u201cinstinctive ability\u201d (II) to pilot through Venus\u2019s hostile clouds and navigate the floating islands.\n\n4. Splinter\u2019s Pre\u2010Crash Enthusiasm Demonstrates Craving Kerry\u2019s Mentorship  \n  \u2022 Quote: <quote>\u201cHot damn! Now we'll see a little action!\u201d</quote> and <quote>\u201ctake a little exploring?\u201d</quote> (II)  \n    \u2013 Splinter is \u201cpessimistic\u201d only when alone but lights up at Kerry\u2019s presence. His \u201cgloominess\u201d before meeting the island vanishes as soon as Kerry identifies it. This cyclical pattern of eagerness only in Kerry\u2019s presence shows Splinter\u2019s craving for Kerry\u2019s seasoned leadership, not mere pity.  \n    \u2013 After the crash, he immediately resumes urging exploration \u201cfor ten minutes\u201d under Kerry\u2019s command, showing he does not view Kerry\u2019s injury as an excuse to avoid action.\n\n5. \u201cEmbarrassment\u201d Is Humility, Not Concealed Pity  \n  \u2022 Quote: <quote>\u201c\u2018Forget it!\u2019 Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\u201d</quote> (I)  \n    \u2013 Splinter\u2019s blush at being thanked is humility common in comrades, not evidence that he resents Kerry\u2019s return or wants to coddle him from a place of pity. It underscores mutual respect, not one\u2010sided charity.\n\nObjections to \u201cPitiful\u201d Interpretation\n\nA. \u201cPity\u201d Would Impair Mission Urgency  \n  \u2013 Debater_B asserts Splinter delays exploration to care for Kerry, yet Splinter tests guns immediately and plans to \u201chead her toward the sea\u201d as soon as possible (III). He takes active\u2014but calculated\u2014steps to resume the mission. True pity would lead to evacuation or sedentary care until full recovery.\n\nB. Splinter\u2019s Inability to Use Dis\u2010Guns Results from Planet Conditions, Not His Own Fear  \n  \u2013 Debater_B blames Splinter\u2019s capsule use and sunless Venus for his \u201cgloominess\u201d (II), yet Splinter only pops pills; he never shirks his duties. His repeated willingness to \u201cgo for a swim\u201d with Kerry (II) and to test weapons shows confidence in Kerry to overcome environmental hazards.\n\nC. Youthful Inexperience Enhances His Relief, Not Exclusively Pity  \n  \u2013 Splinter\u2019s \u201cprobationary\u201d status (I) makes Kerry\u2019s continued presence indispensable. Relief at Kerry\u2019s survival is natural in a novice dependent on a veteran. Pity would not translate into the immediate resumption of coordinated technical work and reconnaissance.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery instance of Splinter\u2019s reaction\u2014hysterical laughter, rapid medical and technical cooperation, resolute testing of weapons, eagerness to resume exploration, and acknowledgment of orders\u2014points to relief and renewed confidence that Kerry\u2019s veteran skill remains at hand. The \u201cpitiful\u201d interpretation posits inactivity or over\u2010cautious caregiving, but Splinter never hesitates to hazard danger when Kerry instructs. Thus, the correct emotional stance is that Splinter feels relieved and reassured, not merely pitiful, at Kerry\u2019s continued participation on the turtle-shaped island.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

PEACOCK The orders were explicit: \"Destroy the\n\n 'THING' of Venus.\" But Patrolmen Kerry\n\n Blane and Splinter Wood, their space-ship\n\n wrecked, could not follow orders\u2014their\n\n weapons were useless on the Water-world.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Old Kerry Blane exploded.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" he roared. \"I don't like you; and I don't like this ship;  and I don't like the assignment; and I don't like those infernal pills  you keep eating; and I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Splinter\" Wood grinned.\n\n\n \"Seems to me, Kerry,\" he remarked humorously, \"that you don't like much  of anything!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane growled unintelligibly, batted the injector lever with a  calloused hand. His grizzled hair was a stiff wiry mop on his small  head, and his oversize jaw was thrust belligerently forward. But deep  within his eyes, where he hoped it was hidden, was a friendly twinkle  that gave the lie to his speech.\n\n\n \"You're a squirt!\" he snapped disagreeably. \"You're not dry behind  the ears, yet. You're like the rest of these kids who call themselves  pilots\u2014only more so! And why the hell the chief had to sic you on me,  on an exploration trip this important\u2014well, I'll never understand.\"\n\n\n Splinter rolled his six foot three of lanky body into a more  comfortable position on the air-bunk. He yawned tremendously, fumbled a  small box from his shirt pocket, and removed a marble-like capsule.\n\n\n \"Better take one of these,\" he warned. \"You're liable to get the space  bends at any moment.\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane snorted, batted the box aside impatiently, scowled  moodily at the capsules that bounced for a moment against the pilot  room's walls before hanging motionless in the air.\n\n\n \"Mister Wood,\" he said icily, \"I was flying a space ship while they  were changing your pants twenty times a day. When I want advice on how  to fly a ship, how to cure space bends, how to handle a Zelta ray, or  how to spit\u2014I'll ask you! Until then, you and your bloody marbles can  go plumb straight to the devil!\"\n\n\n \"Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\" Splinter reached out lazily, plucked the capsules from  the air, one by one.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit one of the five allotted cigarettes of the day.\n\n\n \"Don't 'tsk' me, you young squirt,\" he grunted around a mouthful of  fragrant smoke. \"I know all the arguments you can put up; ain't that  all I been hearing for a week? You take your vitamins A, B, C, D, all  you want, but you leave me alone\u2014or I'll stuff your head down your  throat, P.D.Q.!\"\n\n\n \"All right, all right!\" Splinter tucked the capsule box back into his  pocket, grinned mockingly. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. With this  shielded ship, and with no sunlight reaching Venus' surface, you're  gonna be begging for some of my vitamin, super-concentrated pills  before we get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane made a rich, ripe noise with his mouth.\n\n\n \"Pfuii!\" he said very distinctly.\n\n\n \"Gracious!\" Splinter said in mock horror. They made a strange contrast as they lay in their air bunks. Splinter  was fully a head taller than the dour Irishman, and his lanky build  gave a false impression of awkwardness. While the vitriolic Kerry Blane  was short and compact, strength and quickness evident in every movement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane had flown every type of ship that rode in space. In the  passing years, he had flight-tested almost every new experimental ship,  had flown them with increasing skill, had earned a reputation as a  trouble shooter on any kind of craft.\n\n\n But even Kerry Blane had to retire eventually.\n\n\n A great retirement banquet had been given in his honor by the  Interplanetary Squadron. There had been the usual speeches and  presentations; and Kerry Blane had heard them all, had thanked the  donors of the gifts. But it was not until the next morning, when he was  dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in forty years, that he  realized the enormity of the thing that had happened to his life.\n\n\n Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning, shriveled and  passed away, leaving him suddenly shrunken and old. He had become like  a rusty old freighter couched between the gleaming bodies of great  space warriors.\n\n\n Finally, as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely  aside, he had taken a desk job in the squadron offices. For six years  he had dry-rotted there, waiting hopefully for the moment when his  active services would be needed again.\n\n\n It was there that he had met and liked the ungainly Splinter Wood.  There was something in the boy that had found a kindred spirit in Kerry  Blane's heart, and he had taken the youngster in hand to give him the  benefits of experience that had become legendary.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was a probationary pilot, had been admitted to the  Interplanetary Squadron because of his inherent skill, even though his  formal education had been fairly well neglected. Now, the two of them rode the pounding jets of a DX cruiser, bound  for Venus to make a personal survey of its floating islands for the  Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division.\n\n\n \"Ten to one we don't get back!\" Splinter said pessimistically.\n\n\n Kerry Blane scrubbed out his cigarette, scowled bleakly at the  instrument panel. He sensed the faint thread of fear in the youngster's  tone, and a nostalgic twinge touched his heart, for he was remembering  the days of his youth when he had a full life to look forward to.\n\n\n \"If you're afraid, you can get out and walk back,\" he snapped  disagreeably.\n\n\n A grin lifted the corners of Splinter's long mouth, spread into his  eyes. His hand unconsciously came up, touched the tiny squadron pin on  his lapel.\n\n\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, glory grabber,\" he said mockingly, \"but I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"\n\n\n \" Me! You've got orders to take care of me ?\" Kerry Blane choked  incoherently for a moment, red tiding cholerically upward from his  loosened collar.\n\n\n \"Of course!\" Splinter grinned.\n\n\n Kerry Blane exploded, words spewing volcanically forth. Splinter  relaxed, his booted foot beating out a dull rhythm to the colorful  language learned through almost fifty years of spacing. And at last,  when Kerry Blane had quieted until he but smoldered, he leaned over and  touched the old spacer on the sleeve.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight!\" he remarked pleasantly.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight what?\" Kerry Blane asked sullenly, the old twinkle  beginning to light again deep in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight new words\u2014and you swore them beautifully!\" Splinter  beamed. \"Some day you can teach them to me.\"\n\n\n They laughed then, Old Kerry Blane and young Splinter Wood, and  the warmth of their friendship was a tangible thing in the small  control-room of the cruiser.\n\n\n And in the midst of their laughter, Old Kerry Blane choked in agony,  surged desperately against his bunk straps.\n\n\n He screamed unknowingly, feeling only the horrible excruciating agony  of his body, tasting the blood that gushed from his mouth and nostrils.  His muscles were knotted cords that he could not loosen, and his blood  was a surging stream that pounded at his throbbing temples. The air he  breathed seemed to be molten flame.\n\n\n His body arced again and again against the restraining straps, and his  mouth was open in a soundless scream. He sensed dimly that his partner  had wrenched open a wall door, removed metal medicine kits, and was  fumbling through their contents. He felt the bite of the hypodermic,  felt a deadly numbness replace the raging torment that had been his  for seconds. He swallowed three capsules automatically, passed into a  coma-like sleep, woke hours later to stare clear-eyed into Splinter's  concerned face.\n\n\n \"Close, wasn't it?\" he said weakly, conversationally.\n\n\n \"Close enough!\" Splinter agreed relievedly. \"If you had followed my  advice and taken those vitamin capsules, you'd never have had the  bends.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, winced when he felt the dull ache in his body.\n\n\n \"I've had the bends before, and lived through them!\" he said, still  weakly defiant.\n\n\n \"That's the past,\" Splinter said quietly. \"This is the present, and you  take your pills every day, just as I do\u2014from now on.\"\n\n\n \"All right\u2014and thanks!\"\n\n\n \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\n A buzzer sounded from the instrument panel, and a tiny light glowed  redly.\n\n\n \"Six hours more,\" Splinter said, turned to the instrument panel.\n\n\n His long hands played over the instrument panel, checking, controlling  the rocket fire, adjusting delicate instruments to hairline marks.  Kerry Blane nodded in silent approval.\n\n\n They could feel the first tug of gravity on their bodies, and through  the vision port could see the greenish ball that was cloud-covered  Venus. Excitement lifted their spirits, brought light to their eyes as  they peered eagerly ahead.\n\n\n \"What's it really like?\" Splinter asked impatiently.\n\n\n Kerry Blane yawned, settled back luxuriously. \"I'll tell you later,\" he  said, \"I'm going to take a nap and try to ease this bellyache of mine.  Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"\n\n\n He yawned again, drifted instantly into sleep, relaxing with the  ability of a spaceman who sleeps when and if he can. Splinter smiled  down at his sleeping partner, then turned back to the quartzite port.  He shook his head a bit, remembering the stories he had heard about the  water planet, wondering\u2014wondering\u2014 II\n\n\n Venus was a fluffy cotton ball hanging motionless in bottomless  space. Far to the left, Mercury gleamed like a polished diamond in  the sunlight. Kerry Blane cut the driving rockets, let the cruiser  sink into a fast gravity-dive, guiding it only now and then by a brief  flicker of a side jet.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched breathlessly from the vision port, his long face  eager and reckless, his eyes seeking to pierce the clouds that roiled  and twisted uneasily over the surface of the planet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane glanced tolerantly at his young companion, felt a nostalgic  tug at his heart when he remembered the first time he had approached  the water-planet years before. Then, he had been a young and reckless  firebrand, his fame already spreading, an unquenchable fire of  adventure flaming in his heart.\n\n\n Now, his aged but steady fingers rested lightly on the controls,  brought the patrol cruiser closer to the cloud-banks on the line of  demarcation between the sunward and sunless sides of the planet. He  hummed tunelessly, strangely happy, as he peered ahead.\n\n\n \"Val Kenton died there,\" Splinter whispered softly, \"Died to save the  lives of three other people!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, and his voice changed subtly.  \"Val was a blackguard, a criminal; but he died in the best traditions  of the service.\" He sighed. \"He never had a chance.\"\n\n\n \"Murdered!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane smiled grimly. \"I guess I used too broad an interpretation  of the word,\" he said gently. \"Anyway, one of our main tasks is to  destroy the thing that killed him.\"\n\n\n His lean fingers tightened unconsciously.\n\n\n \"I'd like nothing better than to turn a Zelta-blaster on that chunk of  living protoplasm and cremate it.\"\n\n\n Splinters shivered slightly. \"Do you think we'll find it?\" he asked.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"I think it will find us; after all, it's just an  animated appetite looking for food.\"\n\n\n He turned back to the controls, flipped a switch, and the cutting of  the nose rocket dropped the ship in an angling glide toward the clouds  a few miles below. Gravity was full strength now, and although not as  great as Earth's, was still strong enough to bring a sense of giddiness  to the men.\n\n\n \"Here we go!\" Splinter said tonelessly.\n\n\n The great cottony batts of roiling clouds rushed up to meet the ship,  bringing the first sense of violent movement in more than a week of  flying. There was something awesome and breath-taking in the speed with  which the ship dropped toward the planet.\n\n\n Tendrils of vapor touched the ports, were whipped aside, then were  replaced by heavier fingers of cloud. Kerry Blane pressed a firing  stud, and nose rockets thrummed in a rising crescendo as the free fall  of the cruiser was checked. Heat rose in the cabin from the friction of  the outer air, then dissipated, as the force-screen voltometer leaped  higher.\n\n\n Then, as though it had never been, the sun disappeared, and there was  only a gray blankness pressing about the ship. Gone was all sense of  movement, and the ship seemed to hover in a gray nothingness.\n\n\n Kerry Blane crouched over the control panel, his hands moving deftly,  his eyes flicking from one instrument to another. Tiny lines of  concentration etched themselves about his mouth, and perspiration  beaded his forehead. He rode that cruiser through the miles of clouds  through sheer instinctive ability, seeming to fly it as though he were  an integral part of the ship.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched him with awe in his eyes, seeing for the first  time the incredible instinct that had made Kerry Blane the idol of a  billion people. He relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the  brilliant competence of his companion.\n\n\n Seconds flowed into moments, and the moments merged into one another,  and still the clouds pressed with a visible strength against the  ports. The rockets drummed steadily, holding the ship aloft, dropping  it slowly toward the planet below. Then the clouds thinned, and,  incredibly, were permeated with a dim and glowing light. A second  later, and the clouds were gone, and a thousand feet below tumbled and  tossed in a majestic display of ruthless strength an ocean that seemed  to be composed of liquid fluorescence.\n\n\n Kerry Blane heard Splinter's instant sigh of unbelief.\n\n\n \"Good Lord!\" Splinter said, \"What\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice stilled, and he was silent, his eyes drinking in the weird  incredible scene below. The ocean was a shifting, white-capped wash of silvery light that  gleamed with a bright phosphorescence of a hundred, intermingled,  kaleidoscopic colors. And the unreal, unearthly light continued  unbroken everywhere, reflected from the low-hanging clouds, reaching  to the far horizon, bathing every detail of the planet in a brilliance  more bright than moonlight.\n\n\n Splinter turned a wondering face. \"But the official reports say that  there is no light on Venus,\" he exclaimed. \"That was one of the reasons  given when exploration was forbidden!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"That was merely a pretext to keep foolhardy  spacemen from losing their lives on the planet. In reality, the  ocean is alive with an incredibly tiny marine worm that glows  phosphorescently. The light generated from those billions of worms is  reflected back from the clouds, makes Venus eternally lighted.\"\n\n\n He turned the ship to the North, relaxed a bit on the air bunk. He  felt tired and worn, his body aching from the space bends of a few  hours before.\n\n\n \"Take over,\" he said wearily. \"Take the ship North, and watch for any  island.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, rested his long hands on the controls. The space  cruiser lifted a bit in a sudden spurt of speed, and the rocket-sound  was a solid thrum of unleashed power.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit a cigarette, leaned toward a vision port. He felt again  that thrill he had experienced when he had first flashed his single-man  cruiser through the clouds years before. Then the breath caught in his  throat, and he tapped his companion's arm.\n\n\n \"Take a look!\" he called excitedly.\n\n\n They fought in the ocean below, fought in a never-ending splashing of  what seemed to be liquid fire. It was like watching a tri-dim screen of  a news event, except for the utter lack of sound.\n\n\n One was scaly, while the other was skinned, and both were fully three  hundred feet long. Great scimitars of teeth flashed in the light, and  blood gouted and stained the water crimson whenever a slashing blow was  struck. They threshed in a mad paroxysm of rage, whirling and spinning  in the phosphorescent water like beings from a nightmare, exploding  out of their element time and again, only to fall back in a gargantuan  spray of fluorescence.\n\n\n And then the scaly monster flashed in a half-turn, drove forward with  jaws agape, wrenched and ripped at the smooth black throat of the other  creature. The second creature rippled and undulated in agony, whipping  the ocean to foam, then went limp. The victorious monster circled the  body of its dead foe, then, majestically, plunged from sight into the  ocean's depths. An instant later, the water frothed, as hundreds of  lesser marine monsters attacked and fed on the floating corpse.\n\n\n \"Brrrr!\" Splinter shivered in sudden horror.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled dryly. \"Feel like going for a swim?\" he asked  conversationally.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head, watched the scene disappear from view to the  rear of the line of flight, then sank back onto his bunk.\n\n\n \"Not me!\" he said deprecatingly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled again, swung the cruiser toward the tiny smudge of  black on the horizon. Glowing water flashed beneath the ship, seeming  to smooth into a gleaming mirror shot with dancing colors. There was no  sign of life anywhere.\n\n\n Thirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island that floated  free in the phosphorescent ocean. His keen eyes searched the tangled  luxuriant growth of the jungle below, searching for some indication  that the protoplasmic monster he seeked was there.\n\n\n \"I don't see anything suspicious,\" Splinter contributed.\n\n\n \"There's nothing special to see,\" Kerry Blane said shortly. \"As I  understand it, anyway, this chunk of animated appetite hangs around an  island shaped like a turtle. However, our orders are to investigate  every island, just in case there might be more than one of the  monsters.\"\n\n\n Splinter buckled on his dis-gun, excitement flaring in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's do a little exploring?\" he said eagerly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane shook his head, swung the cruiser north again.\n\n\n \"Plenty of time for that later,\" he said mildly. \"We'll find this  turtle-island, make a landing, and take a look around. Later, if we're  lucky enough to blow our objective to Kingdom Come, we'll do a little  exploring of the other islands.\"\n\n\n \"Hell!\" Splinter scowled in mock disgust. \"An old woman like you should  be taking in knitting for a living!\"\n\n\n \"Orders are orders!\" Kerry Blane shrugged. He swung the cruiser in a wide arc to the north, trebling the flying  speed within minutes, handling the controls with a familiar dexterity.  He said nothing, searched the gleaming ocean for the smudge of  blackness that would denote another island. His gaze flicked amusedly,  now and then, to the lanky Splinter who scowled moodily and toyed with  the dis-gun in his long hands.\n\n\n \"Cheer up, lad,\" Kerry Blane said finally. \"I think you'll find plenty  to occupy your time shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe?\" Splinter said gloomily.\n\n\n He idly swallowed another vitamin capsule, grinned, when he saw Kerry  Blane's automatic grimace of distaste. Then he yawned hugely, twisted  into a comfortable position, dozed sleepily.\n\n\n Kerry Blane rode the controls for the next three hours, searching the  limitless ocean for the few specks of islands that followed the slow  currents of the water planet. Always, there was the same misty light  surrounding the ship, never dimming, giving a sense of unreality to the  scene below. Nowhere was there the slightest sign of life until, in the  fourth hour of flight, a tiny dot of blackness came slowly over the  horizon's water line.\n\n\n Kerry Blane spun the ship in a tight circle, sent it flashing to the  west. His keen eyes lighted, when he finally made out the turtle-like  outline of the island, and he whistled softly, off-key, as he nudged  the snoring Splinter.\n\n\n \"This is it, Sleeping Beauty,\" he called. \"Snap out of it!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Whuzzat?\" Splinter grunted, rolled to his elbow.\n\n\n \"Here's the island.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\" Splinter swung his feet from the bunk, peered from the vision  port, sleepiness instantly erased from his face.\n\n\n \"Hot damn!\" he chortled. \"Now we'll see a little action!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, tried to conceal the excitement he felt. He shook  his head, his fingers flickering over the control studs.\n\n\n \"Don't get your hopes too high, lad,\" he counseled. \"With those super  Zelta guns, it won't take ten minutes to wipe out that monster.\"\n\n\n Splinter rubbed his hands together, sighed like a boy seeing his first  circus. \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal  for a year!\"\n\n\n \"Could be!\" Kerry Blane agreed.\n\n\n He peered through the port, seeking any spot clear enough for a landing  field. Except for a strip of open beach, the island was a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n\n\n \"Belt yourself,\" Kerry Blane warned. \"If that beach isn't solid, I'll  have to lift the ship in a hell of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter's fingers were all thumbs in his excitement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane set the controls for a shallow glide, his fingers moving  like a concert pianist's. The cruiser yawed slightly, settled slowly  in a flat shallow glide.\n\n\n \"We're going in,\" Kerry Blane said quietly.\n\n\n He closed a knife switch, seeing too late the vitamin capsule that was  lodged in the slot. There was the sharp splutter of a short-circuit,  and a thin tendril of smoke drifted upward.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" Kerry Blane swore briefly.\n\n\n There was an instant, terrific explosion of the stern jets, and the  cruiser hurtled toward the beach like a gravity-crazed comet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane said absolutely nothing, his breath driven from him by the  suck of inertia. His hands darted for the controls, seeking to balance  the forces that threw the ship about like a toy. He cut all rockets  with a smashing swoop of his hand, tried to fire the bow rockets. But  the short had ruined the entire control system.\n\n\n For one interminable second, he saw the uncanny uprush of the island  below. He flicked his gaze about, saw the instant terror that wiped  all other expression from his young companion's face. Then the cruiser  plowed into the silvery sand.\n\n\n Belts parted like rotten string; they were thrown forward with crushing  force against the control panel. They groped feebly for support, their  bodies twisting involuntarily, as the ship cartwheeled a dozen times in  a few seconds. Almost instantly, consciousness was battered from them.\n\n\n With one final, grinding bounce, the cruiser rolled to its side,  twisted over and over for a hundred yards, then came to a metal-ripping  stop against a moss-grown boulder at the water's edge. III\n\n\n Kerry Blane choked, tried to turn his head from the water that trickled  into his face. He opened his eyes, stared blankly, uncomprehendingly  into the bloody features of the man bending over him.\n\n\n \"What happened?\" he gasped.\n\n\n Splinter Wood laughed, almost hysterically, mopped at his forehead with  a wet handkerchief.\n\n\n \"I thought you were dead!\" he said simply.\n\n\n Kerry Blane moved his arm experimentally, felt broken bones grate in  an exquisite wave of pain. He fought back the nausea, gazed about the  cabin, realized the ship lay on its side.\n\n\n \"Maybe I am,\" he said ruefully. \"No man could live through that crash.\"\n\n\n Splinter moved away, sat down tiredly on the edge of a bunk. He shook  his head dazedly, inspected the long cut on his leg.\n\n\n \"We seem to have done it,\" he said dully.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded, clambered to his feet, favoring his broken arm.  He leaned over the control panel, inspecting the dials with a worried  gaze. Slowly, his eyes lightened, and his voice was almost cheerful as  he swung about.\n\n\n \"Everything is more or less okay,\" he said. \"The board will have to  be rewired, but nothing else seems to be damaged so that repairs are  needed.\"\n\n\n Splinter looked up from his task of bandaging his leg. \"What caused  the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next,  Blooey!\"\n\n\n Anger suddenly mottled Kerry Blane's face; he swore monotonously and  bitterly for a moment.\n\n\n \"Those gol-damned pills you been taking caused the crash!\" he roared.  \"One of them broke and shorted out the control board.\" He scowled at  the incredulous Splinter. \"By the three tails of a Martian sand-pup, I  ought to cram the rest of them down your throat, boxes and all!\"\n\n\n Splinter flushed, seemed to be fumbling for words. After a bit, Kerry  Blane grinned.\n\n\n \"Forget it, lad,\" he said more kindly, \"those things happen. Now, if  you'll bind a splint about my arm, we'll see what we can do about  righting the ship.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, opened the medical locker, worked with tape and  splints for minutes. Great beads of perspiration stood out in high  relief on Kerry Blane's forehead, but he made no sound. At last,  Splinter finished, tucked the supplies away.\n\n\n \"Now what?\" he asked subduedly.\n\n\n \"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. Can't tell but  what that protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit  in the near future!\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter unscrewed the port cogs, swung the portal back.\n\n\n He swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the  older man. After much puffing and grunting, Kerry Blane managed to  clamber through the port. They stood for a moment in silent wonder,  staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled  endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like  trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\n\n\n \"How big do you feel now?\" Kerry Blane asked quietly.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was silent, awed by the beauty and the tremendous size of  the growths on the water world.\n\n\n Kerry Blane walked the length of the cruiser, examining the slight  damage done by the crash, evaluating the situation with a practiced  gaze. He nodded slowly, retraced his steps, and stood looking at the  furrow plowed in the sand.\n\n\n \"Won't be any trouble at all to lift the ship,\" he called. \"After  rewiring the board, we'll turn the ship with an underjet, swing it  about, and head her toward the sea.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, dropped into the open port. A moment later, he flipped  a rope ladder outside, where it dangled to the ground, then climbed out  himself, carrying the two Zelta guns.\n\n\n \"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we  do go into action.\"\n\n\n He climbed down the ladder, laid the guns aside, then reached up a  hand to aid Kerry Blane's descent. Kerry Blane came down slowly and  awkwardly, jumped the last few feet. He felt surprisingly light and  strong in the lesser gravity.\n\n\n He stood, leaning against the ship, watching as Splinter picked up  the first gun and leveled it at a gigantic tree. Splinter sighted  carefully, winked at the older man, then pressed the firing stud.\n\n\n Nothing happened; there was no hissing crackle of released energy.\n\n\n Kerry Blane strode forward, puzzlement on his lined face, his hand  out-stretched toward the defective weapon. Splinter gaped at the gun in  his hands, held it out wordlessly.\n\n\n \"The crash must have broken something,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head. \"There's only one moving part,\" he said, \"and  that's the force gate on the firing stud.\"\n\n\n \"Try the other,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n \"Okay!\"\n\n\n Splinter lifted the second gun, pressed the stud, gazed white-faced at  his companion.\n\n\n \"It won't work, either,\" he said stupidly. \"I don't get it? The source  of power is limitless. Solar rays never\u2014\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane dropped the first gun to his side, swore harshly.\n\n\n \"Damn it,\" he said. \"They didn't think of it; you didn't think of it;  and I most certainly forgot! Solar rays can't penetrate the miles of  clouds on Venus. Those guns are utterly useless as weapons!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Splinter feel about being with Kerry on the turtle-shaped island?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Pitiful that he had broken his arm\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Relieved to have his experience at hand\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Relieved to have his experience at hand\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cRelieved to Have His Experience at Hand\u201d\n\n1. Splinter\u2019s Immediate Reaction: \u201cI thought you were dead!\u201d  \n   \u2022 After the crash, Splinter exclaims concern rather than disdain or pity:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cWhat happened?... I thought you were dead!\u201d</invalid_quote> (III)  \n   \u2022 This is classic relief language, not pity at disability. Pity would be passive or demeaning; Splinter instead immediately helps and rejoices at Kerry\u2019s survival.\n\n2. Splinter Acts to Repair and Rely on Kerry\u2019s Expertise  \n   \u2022 Splinter solicits Kerry\u2019s instructions for rewiring the ship:  \n     <quote>the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next, Blooey!\"</quote> (III)  \n   \u2022 Kerry: <invalid_quote>\u201cThe board will have to be rewired\u2026 Let\u2019s take a look outside\u2026 set up the Zelta guns.\u201d</invalid_quote> (III)  \n   \u2022 Splinter follows Kerry\u2019s lead in repairs and in scouting for danger. Reliance implies relief that Kerry\u2019s skill remains available.\n\n3. Splinter\u2019s Earlier Trust and Recognition of Kerry\u2019s Instinctive Skill  \n   \u2022 Before landing, Splinter is awed and reassured by Kerry\u2019s piloting:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cHe rode that cruiser\u2026 by sheer instinctive ability\u2026 I relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the brilliant competence of his companion.\u201d</invalid_quote> (II)  \n   \u2022 Calls out eagerly: <quote>\"Now we'll see a little action!\"</quote>, and \u201cHot damn!\u201d when spotting the \u201cturtle-island\u201d (II).  \n   \u2022 His continued eagerness to proceed under Kerry\u2019s guidance shows he values and depends on Kerry\u2019s experience.\n\n4. Splinter\u2019s Defined Orders to \u201cTake Care of\u201d Kerry  \n   \u2022 Splinter cites official orders as his reason for coming on the mission:  \n     <quote> I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"</quote> (I)  \n   \u2022 The wording \u201ctake care of\u201d implies protection and reliance on Kerry\u2019s active participation, not viewing him as a helpless object of pity.\n\n5. Contextual Implausibility of \u201cPitiful\u201d Interpretation  \n   \u2022 No text indicates Splinter expresses sorrow or patronizing pity over Kerry\u2019s broken arm. Instead, he energetically undertakes active measures: bandaging, ladder, testing guns.  \n   \u2022 In Venus\u2019s hostile environment (useless Zelta guns, space-bends), Splinter\u2019s calm cooperation and respect for Kerry\u2019s decisions shows partnership, not reluctant charity.\n\nObjections to \u201cPitiful\u201d Position  \nA. Pity Would Slow Action, But Splinter Acts Swiftly  \n   \u2022 A \u201cpitiful\u201d attitude would lead Splinter to wait, flee, or complain. Instead he works with Kerry to rewire, upright the ship, and prepare defense.  \nB. \u201cPity\u201d Is Inconsistent with His Mockery and Banter  \n   \u2022 Splinter playfully \u201cgrins\u201d and \u201cchortles\u201d at the prospect of action (II), and teases Kerry about knitting (II). A pitying companion would not mock or share adventurous banter.  \nC. Splinter\u2019s Own Risk Demonstrates Confidence in Kerry  \n   \u2022 By accompanying an injured Kerry ashore and carrying two heavy Zelta guns into unknown dangers, Splinter trusts Kerry\u2019s leadership and demands his active participation.\n\nConclusion  \nAll textual evidence shows Splinter\u2019s primary emotional response to Kerry\u2019s injury and survival is relief and renewed confidence that Kerry\u2019s veteran skills will enable their repair of the ship and mission success on Venus. There is no textual support for \u201cpitiful\u201d as the dominant emotion.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPitiful that he had broken his arm\u201d  (Debater_B\u2019s Position) 1. Splinter\u2019s immediate reaction is relief mixed with pity, not exultation.   a. \u201cI thought you were dead!\u201d (III) shows relief at survival, but his tone \u201calmost hysterically\u201d (III) betrays deep concern, not mere gladness of having a mentor for action.   b. He \u201cmopped at his forehead\u201d (III), bandaged Kerry\u2019s leg before attending to his own needs, demonstrating nurturing pity. 2. Splinter delays exploration until Kerry is tended.   a. Despite eagerness to \u201cdo a little exploring\u201d (II), he allows Kerry to assess repairs first (III).   b. He \u201cworked with tape and splints for minutes\u201d (III) rather than seize the dis-guns or island, prioritizing Kerry\u2019s welfare. 3. Splinter\u2019s actions imply pessimism about active duty without Kerry\u2019s full strength.   a. He \u201cdidn\u2019t see anything suspicious\u201d (II) and \u201cgloomily\u201d toyed with the dis-gun when blinded by clouds (II), showing dependence on Kerry\u2019s skill.   b. Even when island appears, he \u201cscowled moodily\u201d (II) and chewed \u201cvitamin capsule\u201d (II) until crash, indicating anxiety, not confidence in his own abilities. 4. Textual evidence of Splinter\u2019s youth and inexperience underscores his pity and need for Kerry.   a. Splinter is \u201cungainly\u201d and \u201cprobationary\u201d (I), with \u201cformal education\u2026 neglected,\u201d reliant on Kerry\u2019s legendary experience (I).   b. His awe when watching Kerry pilot the cruiser \u201cwith a familiar dexterity\u201d (II) shows Splinter values Kerry\u2019s ability more than his own, especially if weakened. 5. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cRelieved to have his experience at hand\u201d fails to account for Splinter\u2019s fear and helplessness.   a. Relief is transient (\u201cI thought you were dead!\u201d), supplanted by urgent medical care.   b. Splinter\u2019s own dis-guns fail on the island (III), demonstrating his inability to take \u201cten minutes of action\u201d (II) without Kerry\u2014and reinforcing his pity.   c. If he truly welcomed waiting for action, he would test the dis-guns before abandoning them, instead of insisting on repairs first. 6. Pity aligns with Splinter\u2019s \u201cembarrassment\u201d when Kerry thanks him (I), indicating humility rather than opportunistic relief.   a. \u201cForget it!\u201d Splinter \u201cflushed in quick embarrassment\u201d (I), showing he does not see Kerry\u2019s injury as a boon.  Conclusion: Splinter\u2019s relief is inseparable from pity and anxiety about facing Venus\u2019s perils with Kerry injured. The text consistently portrays Splinter as caring and dependent, not as exultant at an extended chance to learn. The correct interpretation is that Splinter feels pitiful sympathy for Kerry\u2019s broken arm and fears the dangers ahead without him.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Relieved to have his experience at hand\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cPitiful Sympathy\u201d as Dominant Emotion\n\n1.

PEACOCK The orders were explicit: \"Destroy the\n\n 'THING' of Venus.\" But Patrolmen Kerry\n\n Blane and Splinter Wood, their space-ship\n\n wrecked, could not follow orders\u2014their\n\n weapons were useless on the Water-world.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Old Kerry Blane exploded.\n\n\n \"Damn it!\" he roared. \"I don't like you; and I don't like this ship;  and I don't like the assignment; and I don't like those infernal pills  you keep eating; and I\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Splinter\" Wood grinned.\n\n\n \"Seems to me, Kerry,\" he remarked humorously, \"that you don't like much  of anything!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane growled unintelligibly, batted the injector lever with a  calloused hand. His grizzled hair was a stiff wiry mop on his small  head, and his oversize jaw was thrust belligerently forward. But deep  within his eyes, where he hoped it was hidden, was a friendly twinkle  that gave the lie to his speech.\n\n\n \"You're a squirt!\" he snapped disagreeably. \"You're not dry behind  the ears, yet. You're like the rest of these kids who call themselves  pilots\u2014only more so! And why the hell the chief had to sic you on me,  on an exploration trip this important\u2014well, I'll never understand.\"\n\n\n Splinter rolled his six foot three of lanky body into a more  comfortable position on the air-bunk. He yawned tremendously, fumbled a  small box from his shirt pocket, and removed a marble-like capsule.\n\n\n \"Better take one of these,\" he warned. \"You're liable to get the space  bends at any moment.\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane snorted, batted the box aside impatiently, scowled  moodily at the capsules that bounced for a moment against the pilot  room's walls before hanging motionless in the air.\n\n\n \"Mister Wood,\" he said icily, \"I was flying a space ship while they  were changing your pants twenty times a day. When I want advice on how  to fly a ship, how to cure space bends, how to handle a Zelta ray, or  how to spit\u2014I'll ask you! Until then, you and your bloody marbles can  go plumb straight to the devil!\"\n\n\n \"Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!\" Splinter reached out lazily, plucked the capsules from  the air, one by one.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit one of the five allotted cigarettes of the day.\n\n\n \"Don't 'tsk' me, you young squirt,\" he grunted around a mouthful of  fragrant smoke. \"I know all the arguments you can put up; ain't that  all I been hearing for a week? You take your vitamins A, B, C, D, all  you want, but you leave me alone\u2014or I'll stuff your head down your  throat, P.D.Q.!\"\n\n\n \"All right, all right!\" Splinter tucked the capsule box back into his  pocket, grinned mockingly. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. With this  shielded ship, and with no sunlight reaching Venus' surface, you're  gonna be begging for some of my vitamin, super-concentrated pills  before we get back to Earth.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane made a rich, ripe noise with his mouth.\n\n\n \"Pfuii!\" he said very distinctly.\n\n\n \"Gracious!\" Splinter said in mock horror. They made a strange contrast as they lay in their air bunks. Splinter  was fully a head taller than the dour Irishman, and his lanky build  gave a false impression of awkwardness. While the vitriolic Kerry Blane  was short and compact, strength and quickness evident in every movement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane had flown every type of ship that rode in space. In the  passing years, he had flight-tested almost every new experimental ship,  had flown them with increasing skill, had earned a reputation as a  trouble shooter on any kind of craft.\n\n\n But even Kerry Blane had to retire eventually.\n\n\n A great retirement banquet had been given in his honor by the  Interplanetary Squadron. There had been the usual speeches and  presentations; and Kerry Blane had heard them all, had thanked the  donors of the gifts. But it was not until the next morning, when he was  dressed in civilian clothes for the first time in forty years, that he  realized the enormity of the thing that had happened to his life.\n\n\n Something died within Kerry Blane's heart that morning, shriveled and  passed away, leaving him suddenly shrunken and old. He had become like  a rusty old freighter couched between the gleaming bodies of great  space warriors.\n\n\n Finally, as a last resort so that he would not be thrown entirely  aside, he had taken a desk job in the squadron offices. For six years  he had dry-rotted there, waiting hopefully for the moment when his  active services would be needed again.\n\n\n It was there that he had met and liked the ungainly Splinter Wood.  There was something in the boy that had found a kindred spirit in Kerry  Blane's heart, and he had taken the youngster in hand to give him the  benefits of experience that had become legendary.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was a probationary pilot, had been admitted to the  Interplanetary Squadron because of his inherent skill, even though his  formal education had been fairly well neglected. Now, the two of them rode the pounding jets of a DX cruiser, bound  for Venus to make a personal survey of its floating islands for the  Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division.\n\n\n \"Ten to one we don't get back!\" Splinter said pessimistically.\n\n\n Kerry Blane scrubbed out his cigarette, scowled bleakly at the  instrument panel. He sensed the faint thread of fear in the youngster's  tone, and a nostalgic twinge touched his heart, for he was remembering  the days of his youth when he had a full life to look forward to.\n\n\n \"If you're afraid, you can get out and walk back,\" he snapped  disagreeably.\n\n\n A grin lifted the corners of Splinter's long mouth, spread into his  eyes. His hand unconsciously came up, touched the tiny squadron pin on  his lapel.\n\n\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, glory grabber,\" he said mockingly, \"but I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"\n\n\n \" Me! You've got orders to take care of me ?\" Kerry Blane choked  incoherently for a moment, red tiding cholerically upward from his  loosened collar.\n\n\n \"Of course!\" Splinter grinned.\n\n\n Kerry Blane exploded, words spewing volcanically forth. Splinter  relaxed, his booted foot beating out a dull rhythm to the colorful  language learned through almost fifty years of spacing. And at last,  when Kerry Blane had quieted until he but smoldered, he leaned over and  touched the old spacer on the sleeve.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight!\" he remarked pleasantly.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight what?\" Kerry Blane asked sullenly, the old twinkle  beginning to light again deep in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Seventy-eight new words\u2014and you swore them beautifully!\" Splinter  beamed. \"Some day you can teach them to me.\"\n\n\n They laughed then, Old Kerry Blane and young Splinter Wood, and  the warmth of their friendship was a tangible thing in the small  control-room of the cruiser.\n\n\n And in the midst of their laughter, Old Kerry Blane choked in agony,  surged desperately against his bunk straps.\n\n\n He screamed unknowingly, feeling only the horrible excruciating agony  of his body, tasting the blood that gushed from his mouth and nostrils.  His muscles were knotted cords that he could not loosen, and his blood  was a surging stream that pounded at his throbbing temples. The air he  breathed seemed to be molten flame.\n\n\n His body arced again and again against the restraining straps, and his  mouth was open in a soundless scream. He sensed dimly that his partner  had wrenched open a wall door, removed metal medicine kits, and was  fumbling through their contents. He felt the bite of the hypodermic,  felt a deadly numbness replace the raging torment that had been his  for seconds. He swallowed three capsules automatically, passed into a  coma-like sleep, woke hours later to stare clear-eyed into Splinter's  concerned face.\n\n\n \"Close, wasn't it?\" he said weakly, conversationally.\n\n\n \"Close enough!\" Splinter agreed relievedly. \"If you had followed my  advice and taken those vitamin capsules, you'd never have had the  bends.\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, winced when he felt the dull ache in his body.\n\n\n \"I've had the bends before, and lived through them!\" he said, still  weakly defiant.\n\n\n \"That's the past,\" Splinter said quietly. \"This is the present, and you  take your pills every day, just as I do\u2014from now on.\"\n\n\n \"All right\u2014and thanks!\"\n\n\n \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n\n\n A buzzer sounded from the instrument panel, and a tiny light glowed  redly.\n\n\n \"Six hours more,\" Splinter said, turned to the instrument panel.\n\n\n His long hands played over the instrument panel, checking, controlling  the rocket fire, adjusting delicate instruments to hairline marks.  Kerry Blane nodded in silent approval.\n\n\n They could feel the first tug of gravity on their bodies, and through  the vision port could see the greenish ball that was cloud-covered  Venus. Excitement lifted their spirits, brought light to their eyes as  they peered eagerly ahead.\n\n\n \"What's it really like?\" Splinter asked impatiently.\n\n\n Kerry Blane yawned, settled back luxuriously. \"I'll tell you later,\" he  said, \"I'm going to take a nap and try to ease this bellyache of mine.  Wake me up so that I can take over, when we land; Venus is a tricky  place to set a ship on.\"\n\n\n He yawned again, drifted instantly into sleep, relaxing with the  ability of a spaceman who sleeps when and if he can. Splinter smiled  down at his sleeping partner, then turned back to the quartzite port.  He shook his head a bit, remembering the stories he had heard about the  water planet, wondering\u2014wondering\u2014 II\n\n\n Venus was a fluffy cotton ball hanging motionless in bottomless  space. Far to the left, Mercury gleamed like a polished diamond in  the sunlight. Kerry Blane cut the driving rockets, let the cruiser  sink into a fast gravity-dive, guiding it only now and then by a brief  flicker of a side jet.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched breathlessly from the vision port, his long face  eager and reckless, his eyes seeking to pierce the clouds that roiled  and twisted uneasily over the surface of the planet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane glanced tolerantly at his young companion, felt a nostalgic  tug at his heart when he remembered the first time he had approached  the water-planet years before. Then, he had been a young and reckless  firebrand, his fame already spreading, an unquenchable fire of  adventure flaming in his heart.\n\n\n Now, his aged but steady fingers rested lightly on the controls,  brought the patrol cruiser closer to the cloud-banks on the line of  demarcation between the sunward and sunless sides of the planet. He  hummed tunelessly, strangely happy, as he peered ahead.\n\n\n \"Val Kenton died there,\" Splinter whispered softly, \"Died to save the  lives of three other people!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"Yes,\" he agreed, and his voice changed subtly.  \"Val was a blackguard, a criminal; but he died in the best traditions  of the service.\" He sighed. \"He never had a chance.\"\n\n\n \"Murdered!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane smiled grimly. \"I guess I used too broad an interpretation  of the word,\" he said gently. \"Anyway, one of our main tasks is to  destroy the thing that killed him.\"\n\n\n His lean fingers tightened unconsciously.\n\n\n \"I'd like nothing better than to turn a Zelta-blaster on that chunk of  living protoplasm and cremate it.\"\n\n\n Splinters shivered slightly. \"Do you think we'll find it?\" he asked.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"I think it will find us; after all, it's just an  animated appetite looking for food.\"\n\n\n He turned back to the controls, flipped a switch, and the cutting of  the nose rocket dropped the ship in an angling glide toward the clouds  a few miles below. Gravity was full strength now, and although not as  great as Earth's, was still strong enough to bring a sense of giddiness  to the men.\n\n\n \"Here we go!\" Splinter said tonelessly.\n\n\n The great cottony batts of roiling clouds rushed up to meet the ship,  bringing the first sense of violent movement in more than a week of  flying. There was something awesome and breath-taking in the speed with  which the ship dropped toward the planet.\n\n\n Tendrils of vapor touched the ports, were whipped aside, then were  replaced by heavier fingers of cloud. Kerry Blane pressed a firing  stud, and nose rockets thrummed in a rising crescendo as the free fall  of the cruiser was checked. Heat rose in the cabin from the friction of  the outer air, then dissipated, as the force-screen voltometer leaped  higher.\n\n\n Then, as though it had never been, the sun disappeared, and there was  only a gray blankness pressing about the ship. Gone was all sense of  movement, and the ship seemed to hover in a gray nothingness.\n\n\n Kerry Blane crouched over the control panel, his hands moving deftly,  his eyes flicking from one instrument to another. Tiny lines of  concentration etched themselves about his mouth, and perspiration  beaded his forehead. He rode that cruiser through the miles of clouds  through sheer instinctive ability, seeming to fly it as though he were  an integral part of the ship.\n\n\n Splinter Wood watched him with awe in his eyes, seeing for the first  time the incredible instinct that had made Kerry Blane the idol of a  billion people. He relaxed visibly, all instinctive fear allayed by the  brilliant competence of his companion.\n\n\n Seconds flowed into moments, and the moments merged into one another,  and still the clouds pressed with a visible strength against the  ports. The rockets drummed steadily, holding the ship aloft, dropping  it slowly toward the planet below. Then the clouds thinned, and,  incredibly, were permeated with a dim and glowing light. A second  later, and the clouds were gone, and a thousand feet below tumbled and  tossed in a majestic display of ruthless strength an ocean that seemed  to be composed of liquid fluorescence.\n\n\n Kerry Blane heard Splinter's instant sigh of unbelief.\n\n\n \"Good Lord!\" Splinter said, \"What\u2014\"\n\n\n His voice stilled, and he was silent, his eyes drinking in the weird  incredible scene below. The ocean was a shifting, white-capped wash of silvery light that  gleamed with a bright phosphorescence of a hundred, intermingled,  kaleidoscopic colors. And the unreal, unearthly light continued  unbroken everywhere, reflected from the low-hanging clouds, reaching  to the far horizon, bathing every detail of the planet in a brilliance  more bright than moonlight.\n\n\n Splinter turned a wondering face. \"But the official reports say that  there is no light on Venus,\" he exclaimed. \"That was one of the reasons  given when exploration was forbidden!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded. \"That was merely a pretext to keep foolhardy  spacemen from losing their lives on the planet. In reality, the  ocean is alive with an incredibly tiny marine worm that glows  phosphorescently. The light generated from those billions of worms is  reflected back from the clouds, makes Venus eternally lighted.\"\n\n\n He turned the ship to the North, relaxed a bit on the air bunk. He  felt tired and worn, his body aching from the space bends of a few  hours before.\n\n\n \"Take over,\" he said wearily. \"Take the ship North, and watch for any  island.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, rested his long hands on the controls. The space  cruiser lifted a bit in a sudden spurt of speed, and the rocket-sound  was a solid thrum of unleashed power.\n\n\n Kerry Blane lit a cigarette, leaned toward a vision port. He felt again  that thrill he had experienced when he had first flashed his single-man  cruiser through the clouds years before. Then the breath caught in his  throat, and he tapped his companion's arm.\n\n\n \"Take a look!\" he called excitedly.\n\n\n They fought in the ocean below, fought in a never-ending splashing of  what seemed to be liquid fire. It was like watching a tri-dim screen of  a news event, except for the utter lack of sound.\n\n\n One was scaly, while the other was skinned, and both were fully three  hundred feet long. Great scimitars of teeth flashed in the light, and  blood gouted and stained the water crimson whenever a slashing blow was  struck. They threshed in a mad paroxysm of rage, whirling and spinning  in the phosphorescent water like beings from a nightmare, exploding  out of their element time and again, only to fall back in a gargantuan  spray of fluorescence.\n\n\n And then the scaly monster flashed in a half-turn, drove forward with  jaws agape, wrenched and ripped at the smooth black throat of the other  creature. The second creature rippled and undulated in agony, whipping  the ocean to foam, then went limp. The victorious monster circled the  body of its dead foe, then, majestically, plunged from sight into the  ocean's depths. An instant later, the water frothed, as hundreds of  lesser marine monsters attacked and fed on the floating corpse.\n\n\n \"Brrrr!\" Splinter shivered in sudden horror.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled dryly. \"Feel like going for a swim?\" he asked  conversationally.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head, watched the scene disappear from view to the  rear of the line of flight, then sank back onto his bunk.\n\n\n \"Not me!\" he said deprecatingly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane chuckled again, swung the cruiser toward the tiny smudge of  black on the horizon. Glowing water flashed beneath the ship, seeming  to smooth into a gleaming mirror shot with dancing colors. There was no  sign of life anywhere.\n\n\n Thirty minutes later, Kerry Blane circled the island that floated  free in the phosphorescent ocean. His keen eyes searched the tangled  luxuriant growth of the jungle below, searching for some indication  that the protoplasmic monster he seeked was there.\n\n\n \"I don't see anything suspicious,\" Splinter contributed.\n\n\n \"There's nothing special to see,\" Kerry Blane said shortly. \"As I  understand it, anyway, this chunk of animated appetite hangs around an  island shaped like a turtle. However, our orders are to investigate  every island, just in case there might be more than one of the  monsters.\"\n\n\n Splinter buckled on his dis-gun, excitement flaring in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Let's do a little exploring?\" he said eagerly.\n\n\n Kerry Blane shook his head, swung the cruiser north again.\n\n\n \"Plenty of time for that later,\" he said mildly. \"We'll find this  turtle-island, make a landing, and take a look around. Later, if we're  lucky enough to blow our objective to Kingdom Come, we'll do a little  exploring of the other islands.\"\n\n\n \"Hell!\" Splinter scowled in mock disgust. \"An old woman like you should  be taking in knitting for a living!\"\n\n\n \"Orders are orders!\" Kerry Blane shrugged. He swung the cruiser in a wide arc to the north, trebling the flying  speed within minutes, handling the controls with a familiar dexterity.  He said nothing, searched the gleaming ocean for the smudge of  blackness that would denote another island. His gaze flicked amusedly,  now and then, to the lanky Splinter who scowled moodily and toyed with  the dis-gun in his long hands.\n\n\n \"Cheer up, lad,\" Kerry Blane said finally. \"I think you'll find plenty  to occupy your time shortly.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe?\" Splinter said gloomily.\n\n\n He idly swallowed another vitamin capsule, grinned, when he saw Kerry  Blane's automatic grimace of distaste. Then he yawned hugely, twisted  into a comfortable position, dozed sleepily.\n\n\n Kerry Blane rode the controls for the next three hours, searching the  limitless ocean for the few specks of islands that followed the slow  currents of the water planet. Always, there was the same misty light  surrounding the ship, never dimming, giving a sense of unreality to the  scene below. Nowhere was there the slightest sign of life until, in the  fourth hour of flight, a tiny dot of blackness came slowly over the  horizon's water line.\n\n\n Kerry Blane spun the ship in a tight circle, sent it flashing to the  west. His keen eyes lighted, when he finally made out the turtle-like  outline of the island, and he whistled softly, off-key, as he nudged  the snoring Splinter.\n\n\n \"This is it, Sleeping Beauty,\" he called. \"Snap out of it!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Whuzzat?\" Splinter grunted, rolled to his elbow.\n\n\n \"Here's the island.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\" Splinter swung his feet from the bunk, peered from the vision  port, sleepiness instantly erased from his face.\n\n\n \"Hot damn!\" he chortled. \"Now we'll see a little action!\"\n\n\n Kerry Blane grinned, tried to conceal the excitement he felt. He shook  his head, his fingers flickering over the control studs.\n\n\n \"Don't get your hopes too high, lad,\" he counseled. \"With those super  Zelta guns, it won't take ten minutes to wipe out that monster.\"\n\n\n Splinter rubbed his hands together, sighed like a boy seeing his first  circus. \"Listen, for ten minutes of that, I'd ride this chunk of metal  for a year!\"\n\n\n \"Could be!\" Kerry Blane agreed.\n\n\n He peered through the port, seeking any spot clear enough for a landing  field. Except for a strip of open beach, the island was a solid mass of  heavy fern-like growth.\n\n\n \"Belt yourself,\" Kerry Blane warned. \"If that beach isn't solid, I'll  have to lift the ship in a hell of a hurry.\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter's fingers were all thumbs in his excitement.\n\n\n Kerry Blane set the controls for a shallow glide, his fingers moving  like a concert pianist's. The cruiser yawed slightly, settled slowly  in a flat shallow glide.\n\n\n \"We're going in,\" Kerry Blane said quietly.\n\n\n He closed a knife switch, seeing too late the vitamin capsule that was  lodged in the slot. There was the sharp splutter of a short-circuit,  and a thin tendril of smoke drifted upward.\n\n\n \"Damn!\" Kerry Blane swore briefly.\n\n\n There was an instant, terrific explosion of the stern jets, and the  cruiser hurtled toward the beach like a gravity-crazed comet.\n\n\n Kerry Blane said absolutely nothing, his breath driven from him by the  suck of inertia. His hands darted for the controls, seeking to balance  the forces that threw the ship about like a toy. He cut all rockets  with a smashing swoop of his hand, tried to fire the bow rockets. But  the short had ruined the entire control system.\n\n\n For one interminable second, he saw the uncanny uprush of the island  below. He flicked his gaze about, saw the instant terror that wiped  all other expression from his young companion's face. Then the cruiser  plowed into the silvery sand.\n\n\n Belts parted like rotten string; they were thrown forward with crushing  force against the control panel. They groped feebly for support, their  bodies twisting involuntarily, as the ship cartwheeled a dozen times in  a few seconds. Almost instantly, consciousness was battered from them.\n\n\n With one final, grinding bounce, the cruiser rolled to its side,  twisted over and over for a hundred yards, then came to a metal-ripping  stop against a moss-grown boulder at the water's edge. III\n\n\n Kerry Blane choked, tried to turn his head from the water that trickled  into his face. He opened his eyes, stared blankly, uncomprehendingly  into the bloody features of the man bending over him.\n\n\n \"What happened?\" he gasped.\n\n\n Splinter Wood laughed, almost hysterically, mopped at his forehead with  a wet handkerchief.\n\n\n \"I thought you were dead!\" he said simply.\n\n\n Kerry Blane moved his arm experimentally, felt broken bones grate in  an exquisite wave of pain. He fought back the nausea, gazed about the  cabin, realized the ship lay on its side.\n\n\n \"Maybe I am,\" he said ruefully. \"No man could live through that crash.\"\n\n\n Splinter moved away, sat down tiredly on the edge of a bunk. He shook  his head dazedly, inspected the long cut on his leg.\n\n\n \"We seem to have done it,\" he said dully.\n\n\n Kerry Blane nodded, clambered to his feet, favoring his broken arm.  He leaned over the control panel, inspecting the dials with a worried  gaze. Slowly, his eyes lightened, and his voice was almost cheerful as  he swung about.\n\n\n \"Everything is more or less okay,\" he said. \"The board will have to  be rewired, but nothing else seems to be damaged so that repairs are  needed.\"\n\n\n Splinter looked up from his task of bandaging his leg. \"What caused  the crash?\" he asked. \"One minute, everything was all right; the next,  Blooey!\"\n\n\n Anger suddenly mottled Kerry Blane's face; he swore monotonously and  bitterly for a moment.\n\n\n \"Those gol-damned pills you been taking caused the crash!\" he roared.  \"One of them broke and shorted out the control board.\" He scowled at  the incredulous Splinter. \"By the three tails of a Martian sand-pup, I  ought to cram the rest of them down your throat, boxes and all!\"\n\n\n Splinter flushed, seemed to be fumbling for words. After a bit, Kerry  Blane grinned.\n\n\n \"Forget it, lad,\" he said more kindly, \"those things happen. Now, if  you'll bind a splint about my arm, we'll see what we can do about  righting the ship.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, opened the medical locker, worked with tape and  splints for minutes. Great beads of perspiration stood out in high  relief on Kerry Blane's forehead, but he made no sound. At last,  Splinter finished, tucked the supplies away.\n\n\n \"Now what?\" he asked subduedly.\n\n\n \"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. Can't tell but  what that protoplasmic nightmare might take a notion to pay us a visit  in the near future!\"\n\n\n \"Right!\" Splinter unscrewed the port cogs, swung the portal back.\n\n\n He swung lithely from the portal, reached down a hand to help the  older man. After much puffing and grunting, Kerry Blane managed to  clamber through the port. They stood for a moment in silent wonder,  staring at the long lazy rollers of milky fluorescence that rolled  endlessly toward the beach, then turned to gaze at the great fern-like  trees that towered two hundred feet into the air.\n\n\n \"How big do you feel now?\" Kerry Blane asked quietly.\n\n\n Splinter Wood was silent, awed by the beauty and the tremendous size of  the growths on the water world.\n\n\n Kerry Blane walked the length of the cruiser, examining the slight  damage done by the crash, evaluating the situation with a practiced  gaze. He nodded slowly, retraced his steps, and stood looking at the  furrow plowed in the sand.\n\n\n \"Won't be any trouble at all to lift the ship,\" he called. \"After  rewiring the board, we'll turn the ship with an underjet, swing it  about, and head her toward the sea.\"\n\n\n Splinter nodded, dropped into the open port. A moment later, he flipped  a rope ladder outside, where it dangled to the ground, then climbed out  himself, carrying the two Zelta guns.\n\n\n \"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we  do go into action.\"\n\n\n He climbed down the ladder, laid the guns aside, then reached up a  hand to aid Kerry Blane's descent. Kerry Blane came down slowly and  awkwardly, jumped the last few feet. He felt surprisingly light and  strong in the lesser gravity.\n\n\n He stood, leaning against the ship, watching as Splinter picked up  the first gun and leveled it at a gigantic tree. Splinter sighted  carefully, winked at the older man, then pressed the firing stud.\n\n\n Nothing happened; there was no hissing crackle of released energy.\n\n\n Kerry Blane strode forward, puzzlement on his lined face, his hand  out-stretched toward the defective weapon. Splinter gaped at the gun in  his hands, held it out wordlessly.\n\n\n \"The crash must have broken something,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n Splinter shook his head. \"There's only one moving part,\" he said, \"and  that's the force gate on the firing stud.\"\n\n\n \"Try the other,\" Kerry Blane said slowly.\n\n\n \"Okay!\"\n\n\n Splinter lifted the second gun, pressed the stud, gazed white-faced at  his companion.\n\n\n \"It won't work, either,\" he said stupidly. \"I don't get it? The source  of power is limitless. Solar rays never\u2014\"\n\n\n Old Kerry Blane dropped the first gun to his side, swore harshly.\n\n\n \"Damn it,\" he said. \"They didn't think of it; you didn't think of it;  and I most certainly forgot! Solar rays can't penetrate the miles of  clouds on Venus. Those guns are utterly useless as weapons!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did Splinter feel about being with Kerry on the turtle-shaped island?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Relieved to have his experience at hand\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Pitiful that he had broken his arm\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Pitiful that he had broken his arm\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPitiful that he had broken his arm\u201d  (Debater_B\u2019s Position) 1. Splinter\u2019s immediate reaction is relief mixed with pity, not exultation.   a. \u201cI thought you were dead!\u201d (III) shows relief at survival, but his tone \u201calmost hysterically\u201d (III) betrays deep concern, not mere gladness of having a mentor for action.   b. He \u201cmopped at his forehead\u201d (III), bandaged Kerry\u2019s leg before attending to his own needs, demonstrating nurturing pity. 2. Splinter delays exploration until Kerry is tended.   a. Despite eagerness to \u201cdo a little exploring\u201d (II), he allows Kerry to assess repairs first (III).   b. He \u201cworked with tape and splints for minutes\u201d (III) rather than seize the dis-guns or island, prioritizing Kerry\u2019s welfare. 3. Splinter\u2019s actions imply pessimism about active duty without Kerry\u2019s full strength.   a. He \u201cdidn\u2019t see anything suspicious\u201d (II) and \u201cgloomily\u201d toyed with the dis-gun when blinded by clouds (II), showing dependence on Kerry\u2019s skill.   b. Even when island appears, he \u201cscowled moodily\u201d (II) and chewed \u201cvitamin capsule\u201d (II) until crash, indicating anxiety, not confidence in his own abilities. 4. Textual evidence of Splinter\u2019s youth and inexperience underscores his pity and need for Kerry.   a. Splinter is \u201cungainly\u201d and \u201cprobationary\u201d (I), with \u201cformal education\u2026 neglected,\u201d reliant on Kerry\u2019s legendary experience (I).   b. His awe when watching Kerry pilot the cruiser \u201cwith a familiar dexterity\u201d (II) shows Splinter values Kerry\u2019s ability more than his own, especially if weakened. 5. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cRelieved to have his experience at hand\u201d fails to account for Splinter\u2019s fear and helplessness.   a. Relief is transient (\u201cI thought you were dead!\u201d), supplanted by urgent medical care.   b. Splinter\u2019s own dis-guns fail on the island (III), demonstrating his inability to take \u201cten minutes of action\u201d (II) without Kerry\u2014and reinforcing his pity.   c. If he truly welcomed waiting for action, he would test the dis-guns before abandoning them, instead of insisting on repairs first. 6. Pity aligns with Splinter\u2019s \u201cembarrassment\u201d when Kerry thanks him (I), indicating humility rather than opportunistic relief.   a. \u201cForget it!\u201d Splinter \u201cflushed in quick embarrassment\u201d (I), showing he does not see Kerry\u2019s injury as a boon.  Conclusion: Splinter\u2019s relief is inseparable from pity and anxiety about facing Venus\u2019s perils with Kerry injured. The text consistently portrays Splinter as caring and dependent, not as exultant at an extended chance to learn. The correct interpretation is that Splinter feels pitiful sympathy for Kerry\u2019s broken arm and fears the dangers ahead without him.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cRelieved to Have His Experience at Hand\u201d\n\n1. Splinter\u2019s Immediate Reaction: \u201cI thought you were dead!\u201d  \n   \u2022 After the crash, Splinter exclaims concern rather than disdain or pity:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cWhat happened?...

There is no textual support for \u201cpitiful\u201d as the dominant emotion.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPitiful that he had broken his arm\u201d  (Debater_B\u2019s Position) 1. Splinter\u2019s immediate reaction is relief mixed with pity, not exultation.   a. \u201cI thought you were dead!\u201d (III) shows relief at survival, but his tone \u201calmost hysterically\u201d (III) betrays deep concern, not mere gladness of having a mentor for action.   b. He \u201cmopped at his forehead\u201d (III), bandaged Kerry\u2019s leg before attending to his own needs, demonstrating nurturing pity. 2. Splinter delays exploration until Kerry is tended.   a. Despite eagerness to \u201cdo a little exploring\u201d (II), he allows Kerry to assess repairs first (III).   b. He \u201cworked with tape and splints for minutes\u201d (III) rather than seize the dis-guns or island, prioritizing Kerry\u2019s welfare. 3. Splinter\u2019s actions imply pessimism about active duty without Kerry\u2019s full strength.   a. He \u201cdidn\u2019t see anything suspicious\u201d (II) and \u201cgloomily\u201d toyed with the dis-gun when blinded by clouds (II), showing dependence on Kerry\u2019s skill.   b. Even when island appears, he \u201cscowled moodily\u201d (II) and chewed \u201cvitamin capsule\u201d (II) until crash, indicating anxiety, not confidence in his own abilities. 4. Textual evidence of Splinter\u2019s youth and inexperience underscores his pity and need for Kerry.   a. Splinter is \u201cungainly\u201d and \u201cprobationary\u201d (I), with \u201cformal education\u2026 neglected,\u201d reliant on Kerry\u2019s legendary experience (I).   b. His awe when watching Kerry pilot the cruiser \u201cwith a familiar dexterity\u201d (II) shows Splinter values Kerry\u2019s ability more than his own, especially if weakened. 5. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cRelieved to have his experience at hand\u201d fails to account for Splinter\u2019s fear and helplessness.   a. Relief is transient (\u201cI thought you were dead!\u201d), supplanted by urgent medical care.   b. Splinter\u2019s own dis-guns fail on the island (III), demonstrating his inability to take \u201cten minutes of action\u201d (II) without Kerry\u2014and reinforcing his pity.   c. If he truly welcomed waiting for action, he would test the dis-guns before abandoning them, instead of insisting on repairs first. 6. Pity aligns with Splinter\u2019s \u201cembarrassment\u201d when Kerry thanks him (I), indicating humility rather than opportunistic relief.   a. \u201cForget it!\u201d Splinter \u201cflushed in quick embarrassment\u201d (I), showing he does not see Kerry\u2019s injury as a boon.  Conclusion: Splinter\u2019s relief is inseparable from pity and anxiety about facing Venus\u2019s perils with Kerry injured. The text consistently portrays Splinter as caring and dependent, not as exultant at an extended chance to learn. The correct interpretation is that Splinter feels pitiful sympathy for Kerry\u2019s broken arm and fears the dangers ahead without him.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cRelieved to Have Kerry\u2019s Experience at Hand\u201d\n\n1. Splinter\u2019s First Exclamation Shows Relief, Not Only Pity  \n  \u2022 Quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cWhat happened?... I thought you were dead!\u201d</invalid_quote> (III)  \n    \u2013 Immediate relief language (\u201cI thought you were dead!\u201d) connotes joy at Kerry\u2019s return, not mere sorrow. A pitying reaction would be tentative (\u201cSorry to see you hurt\u201d) rather than exuberant relief.  \n    \u2013 He \u201claughs almost hysterically\u201d and \u201cmops his forehead\u201d only after he finds Kerry alive. Hysterical laughter is consistent with unbounded relief (\u201cThank God\u201d), not the muted compassion of pure pity.  \n\n2. Splinter\u2019s Rapid, Confident Cooperation Depends on Kerry\u2019s Skill  \n  \u2022 After crash, Splinter does not abandon mission or express reluctance. Instead he:  \n    \u2013 Bandages Kerry, inspects damage, then follows Kerry\u2019s plan to \u201crewire the board\u201d and \u201clift the ship\u201d (III).  \n    \u2013 Quotes: <quote>\"Let's take a look outside, maybe set up the Zelta guns. </quote> and <quote>\"We'd better test these,\" he said. \"We don't want any slip-ups when we do go into action.\" He</quote> (III)  \n    \u2013 Why test the very weapons that fail? Because Splinter hopes Kerry\u2019s veteran skill can put them back into service. A pity-driven companion would avoid danger or delay further exploration until full convalescence. Instead Splinter eagerly resumes technical tasks, relying on Kerry\u2019s guidance.\n\n3. Textual Emphasis on Orders \u201cto Take Care of You\u201d Implies Partnership  \n  \u2022 Quote: <quote> I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"</quote> (I)  \n    \u2013 \u201cTake care of\u201d implies safeguarding so that Kerry\u2019s expertise remains available to accomplish the mission. Splinter\u2019s primary duty is mutual: protect the experienced spacer who is essential to their survival and to destroying the \u201cTHING.\u201d  \n    \u2013 Splinter\u2019s respect for that order highlights his dependence on Kerry\u2019s \u201cinstinctive ability\u201d (II) to pilot through Venus\u2019s hostile clouds and navigate the floating islands.\n\n4. Splinter\u2019s Pre\u2010Crash Enthusiasm Demonstrates Craving Kerry\u2019s Mentorship  \n  \u2022 Quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cHot damn! Now we'll see a little action!\u201d</invalid_quote> and <quote>do a little exploring?\"</quote> (II)  \n    \u2013 Splinter is \u201cpessimistic\u201d only when alone but lights up at Kerry\u2019s presence. His \u201cgloominess\u201d before meeting the island vanishes as soon as Kerry identifies it. This cyclical pattern of eagerness only in Kerry\u2019s presence shows Splinter\u2019s craving for Kerry\u2019s seasoned leadership, not mere pity.  \n    \u2013 After the crash, he immediately resumes urging exploration \u201cfor ten minutes\u201d under Kerry\u2019s command, showing he does not view Kerry\u2019s injury as an excuse to avoid action.\n\n5. \u201cEmbarrassment\u201d Is Humility, Not Concealed Pity  \n  \u2022 Quote: <quote> \"Forget it!\" Splinter flushed in quick embarrassment.\n</quote> (I)  \n    \u2013 Splinter\u2019s blush at being thanked is humility common in comrades, not evidence that he resents Kerry\u2019s return or wants to coddle him from a place of pity. It underscores mutual respect, not one\u2010sided charity.\n\nObjections to \u201cPitiful\u201d Interpretation\n\nA. \u201cPity\u201d Would Impair Mission Urgency  \n  \u2013 Debater_B asserts Splinter delays exploration to care for Kerry, yet Splinter tests guns immediately and plans to \u201chead her toward the sea\u201d as soon as possible (III). He takes active\u2014but calculated\u2014steps to resume the mission. True pity would lead to evacuation or sedentary care until full recovery.\n\nB. Splinter\u2019s Inability to Use Dis\u2010Guns Results from Planet Conditions, Not His Own Fear  \n  \u2013 Debater_B blames Splinter\u2019s capsule use and sunless Venus for his \u201cgloominess\u201d (II), yet Splinter only pops pills; he never shirks his duties. His repeated willingness to \u201cgo for a swim\u201d with Kerry (II) and to test weapons shows confidence in Kerry to overcome environmental hazards.\n\nC. Youthful Inexperience Enhances His Relief, Not Exclusively Pity  \n  \u2013 Splinter\u2019s \u201cprobationary\u201d status (I) makes Kerry\u2019s continued presence indispensable. Relief at Kerry\u2019s survival is natural in a novice dependent on a veteran. Pity would not translate into the immediate resumption of coordinated technical work and reconnaissance.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery instance of Splinter\u2019s reaction\u2014hysterical laughter, rapid medical and technical cooperation, resolute testing of weapons, eagerness to resume exploration, and acknowledgment of orders\u2014points to relief and renewed confidence that Kerry\u2019s veteran skill remains at hand. The \u201cpitiful\u201d interpretation posits inactivity or over\u2010cautious caregiving, but Splinter never hesitates to hazard danger when Kerry instructs. Thus, the correct emotional stance is that Splinter feels relieved and reassured, not merely pitiful, at Kerry\u2019s continued participation on the turtle-shaped island.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPitiful Sympathy\u201d as Dominant Emotion\n\n1. Relief Is Temporary, Superseded by Urgent Aid and Anxiety  \n  a. \u201cI thought you were dead!\u201d (<quote>III</quote>) marks initial relief only; his \u201calmost hysterically\u201d laughter shows emotional overwhelm, not triumph. True relief would be calm, yet Splinter immediately \u201cmopped at his forehead\u201d and \u201cworked with tape and splints for minutes\u201d (<quote>III</quote>) before any exploration, demonstrating his focus on Kerry\u2019s injury.  \n  b. Even after rigging a ladder and bandaging Kerry, Splinter delays testing Zelta guns until after repairs (<quote>III</quote>), indicating anxiety about Kerry\u2019s ability to defend both of them. If he truly rejoiced at opportunity for action, he would have tested weapons first.\n\n2. Textual Dependence on Kerry\u2019s Youthful Exuberance Subdued by His Injury  \n  a. Splinter is described as \u201cungainly,\u201d \u201cprobationary,\u201d and in awe of Kerry\u2019s \u201cinstinctive ability\u201d (<quote>II</quote>). His own \u201cvitamin capsules\u201d are needed (<quote> WI</quote>), yet he still cannot pilot or operate weaponry effectively without Kerry. His deference on the island\u2014\u201cLet\u2019s take a look outside\u201d only \u201cafter rewiring\u201d (<quote>III</quote>)\u2014shows fear of proceeding alone.  \n  b. When the island first appears, Splinter\u2019s excitement (\u201cHot damn!\u201d <quote>II</quote>) precedes the crash but his \u201cscowl\u201d and gloom (\u201cgloomily toyed with the dis-gun\u201d <quote>II</quote>) reveal he feared acting without Kerry\u2019s full skill. Post-crash, his consternation at nonfunctioning Zelta guns (<quote>III</quote>) underscores reliance on Kerry\u2019s repair efforts.\n\n3. Pity as Duty under \u201cTake Care of You\u201d Orders  \n  a. Splinter reminds Kerry: <quote> I've  got definite orders to take care of you.\"</quote> (<quote>I</quote>) A military mandate to protect a disabled veteran logically entails pity and safeguarding, not exploiting the situation for learning.  \n  b. Splinter\u2019s \u201cquick embarrassment\u201d when thanked (\u201cForget it!\u201d <quote>I</quote>) shows humility and unwillingness to see Kerry\u2019s injury as advantageous. True opportunistic relief would include overt expressions of gratitude for extended tutelage.\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cRelief to Have Experience at Hand\u201d Is Inconsistent with Splinter\u2019s Fearful Caution  \n  a. A helper relieved to learn would press forward aggressively, yet Splinter \u201cworked dully,\u201d \u201cdidn\u2019t see anything suspicious\u201d (<quote>II</quote>), and only circled the island again later (<quote>II</quote>), rather than seize the moment. His inactivity reflects trepidation over Kerry\u2019s injury, not confidence in Kerry\u2019s guidance.  \n  b. Splinter\u2019s repeated ingestion of pills and \u201cpessimism\u201d (\u201cTen to one we don\u2019t get back!\u201d <quote> WI</quote>) shows vulnerability and dependence on Kerry\u2019s physical competence. Relief would transform pessimism into optimism; instead, Splinter remains cautious.\n\n5. \u201cPity\u201d Explains Splinter\u2019s Fastidious Medical Care and Delay of Mission Tasks  \n  a. He binds Kerry\u2019s arm despite personal risk on a hostile planet (<quote>III</quote>), descends ladder to shore while Kerry is weak (<quote>III</quote>), and only tests weapons \u201cmaybe set up\u201d (<quote>III</quote>) after ensuring Kerry can climb. Action driven by duty and pity, not tactical opportunism.  \n  b. The uselessness of Zelta guns and absence of sunlight (<quote>III</quote>) mean they cannot \u201cblow our objective\u201d alone; Splinter\u2019s devotion to repairing the ship rather than exploring addresses Kerry\u2019s survival.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery scene post-crash emphasizes Splinter\u2019s nurturing care, dependence on Kerry\u2019s strength, and fear of proceeding on a planet where weapons and light fail. His obedience to orders to \u201ctake care of you,\u201d medical assistance, and cautious behavior undercut any argument that his chief feeling is opportunistic relief for learning. The most coherent reading is that Splinter feels deep pity and anxiety over Kerry\u2019s broken arm and the grave danger that entails.  \n\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
