{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 163, "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent.

But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

By contrast, the notion that the fallacy is merely \u201csetting the employment capacity for the economy in danger\u201d (Debater_B\u2019s position) misreads the text: the author explicitly praises the Fed\u2019s control over employment outcomes (\u201cvisible hand\u2026 pushing us toward\u2026 unemployment rate,\u201d <quote> here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be,</quote>) as restoring classical principles and rendering Keynesian paradoxes irrelevant.  \n\nI.

The author ridicules \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d who argue savings are bad despite conceding Fed power, calling their position self-refuting: either \u201cinterest rates have no effect\u201d (clearly false, as the homebuilders attest) or \u201cpotential savings\u2026 so high\u2026 Fed cannot bring the two in line\u201d (only plausible in a deep liquidity trap like 1930s or Japan).

The author never criticizes any single \u201cemployment capacity\u201d target; rather he endorses Fed targeting (\u201cvisible hand\u2026 pushing us toward its estimate\u2026 end of story\u201d).  \n   b. His objection is solely to the na\u00efve view that \u201creduced consumer spending is always a bad thing\u201d when Fed can offset it.  \n2. Public debates on NAFTA ignore this Fed-offset point; author laments \u201cobvious\u2026 never made it into public consciousness\u201d (<quote>\"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\")</quote>). This shows the target is popular Keynesian caricatures, not Fed targeting.  \n\nIV. Supporting Evidence from Background Text  \n1. \u201cIn the long run we are all dead\u2026 if investment demand\u2026 falls\u2026 the result would be\u2026 slump\u201d (<invalid_quote>Keynes\u2019s short-run insight</invalid_quote>), but Fed overrides in practice.  \n2. \u201cFed can double the money supply in a day\u2026 level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go\u2014end of story.\u201d (<invalid_quote>author\u2019s analogy to gas pedal</invalid_quote>).  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s unambiguous argument is that \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d is internally inconsistent once one concedes the very Fed authority these Keynesians themselves invoke to justify rate cuts. This contradiction is the fallacy he exposes. Debater_B\u2019s interpretation has no grounding in the text: rather than criticizing Fed targets, the author upholds them and uses them to dissolve Keynesian paradoxes. Therefore the correct answer is indeed the inconsistency between Fed control of interest rates and the claim that increased savings depress growth.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary (our position): The author\u2019s chief \u201cfallacy\u201d is relying on the Fed\u2019s ability to set and maintain a \u201cnoninflationary unemployment rate\u201d as though that mandate is both precise and safe. In other words, trusting a central banker to \u201cpush us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate\u201d is inherently dangerous, since that estimate is uncertain, subject to lagged effects, and ignores real\u2010world distortions, just as classical economists erred by overtrusting the invisible hand. \n\n1. The author himself calls Fed policy a \u201clooking-glass world\u201d that \u201crestores much of the classical vision,\u201d implying a symmetry with the dogmatism he criticizes in early Keynesians. \n   - \u201cInstead of an invisible hand\u2026, we have the visible hand of the Fed\u2026 To accomplish this\u2026the board must raise or lower interest rates\u2026.\u201d <invalid_quote>paras. 12-13</invalid_quote>  \n   - Yet he also acknowledges real\u2010world errors: \u201cplus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that [the Fed chairman] is not quite God.\u201d <invalid_quote>para. 11</invalid_quote>  \n   - If the Fed is \u201cnot quite God,\u201d relying on its \u201cestimate\u201d is no more reliable than the classical economists\u2019 faith in full\u2010employment equilibrium.\n\n2. Monetary policy lags and the zero lower bound limit its effectiveness, exactly the circumstances the author admits:\n   - \u201cThe latter\u2026was reasonable\u2026in the 1930s\u2026where the rate\u2026was less than one-tenth\u2026; it is arguable\u2026for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent.\u201d <invalid_quote>para. 18</invalid_quote>  \n   - If near\u2010zero rates defeat stimulus in Japan, how can we be sure the Fed\u2019s target can safely absorb demand shocks without triggering deflation or asset bubbles?  \n\n3. The public debate over NAFTA shows policy fixation on \u201cjob creation or destruction,\u201d not recognizing the Fed\u2019s limited power:\n   - \u201cThe obvious\u2026point\u2026never made it into the public consciousness\u2026because people \u2018hate economists!\u2019\u201d <invalid_quote>para. 15</invalid_quote>  \n   - The author\u2019s complaint that people ignore Fed targets betrays the fragility of his own position: if the \u201cvisible hand\u201d were truly sufficient, public debate would reflect that confidence.\n\n4. Savings/investment paradox depends on policy inaction or misjudgment, not on some immutable \u201cpropensity to save\u201d:\n   - \u201cYou must argue either that interest rates have no effect\u2026or that potential savings are so high\u2026that the Fed cannot bring the two in line\u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>para. 17</invalid_quote>  \n   - Those who argue \u201csavings are bad\u201d consistently conclude the Fed must \u201cstimulate growth by cutting interest rates.\u201d <invalid_quote>para. 20</invalid_quote>  \n   - If the Fed were truly omnipotent, no one would protest its policy or urge it to cut rates; universal acceptance would prevail (contrary to reality).  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFederal Reserve omnipotence\u201d theory:\n\nA1. Contradiction in Keynesian appeals. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cfallacy\u201d claim (that Fed power and savings\u2010bad cannot coexist) is refuted by the Keynesians themselves, who incessantly call for lower rates precisely because policy has failed. They:\n   - Accept Fed impotence in practice (\u201cdisappointing performance of the U.S. economy\u2026all the Fed\u2019s fault\u201d), so they do not truly believe in absolute control.  \n   - Yet continue to believe savings depress growth. That mindset only makes sense if the Fed\u2019s targeting is dangerous or miscalibrated.\n\nA2. Ignores real macro evidence of stagflation. In the 1970s, Fed policy aiming for a low\u2010unemployment target led to runaway inflation, undermining \u201cnoninflationary unemployment\u201d and demonstrating the central\u2010planning fallacy.\n\nA3. Overlooks distributional and sectoral misallocations. Monetary policy cannot direct credit efficiently to productive uses; it encourages asset\u2010price inflation, housing bubbles, and malinvestment, ultimately undermining sustainable growth and full employment.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s real \u201cfallacy\u201d is central\u2010planning hubris\u2014believing that setting an aggregate \u201cemployment capacity\u201d via interest\u2010rate targets is safe and sufficient. Just as classical theorists erred by neglecting short\u2010run slumps, so vulgar Keynesians err by neglecting the Fed\u2019s misjudgments, lags, and distributional distortions. The debate over NAFTA and repeated calls for ever\u2010lower rates reveal the fragility of trusting the \u201cvisible hand.\u201d Our thesis\u2014\u201cSetting the employment capacity for the economy is dangerous\u201d\u2014best captures the systemic risk and fallacy the author warns about.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument Summary (Debater_B): The author\u2019s true \u201cfallacy\u201d warning is against overreliance on the Fed\u2019s ability to pick and safely maintain an optimal unemployment (employment capacity).

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the fallacy that the author presents?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary (our position): The author\u2019s chief \u201cfallacy\u201d is relying on the Fed\u2019s ability to set and maintain a \u201cnoninflationary unemployment rate\u201d as though that mandate is both precise and safe. In other words, trusting a central banker to \u201cpush us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate\u201d is inherently dangerous, since that estimate is uncertain, subject to lagged effects, and ignores real\u2010world distortions, just as classical economists erred by overtrusting the invisible hand. \n\n1.

Overlooks distributional and sectoral misallocations. Monetary policy cannot direct credit efficiently to productive uses; it encourages asset\u2010price inflation, housing bubbles, and malinvestment, ultimately undermining sustainable growth and full employment.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s real \u201cfallacy\u201d is central\u2010planning hubris\u2014believing that setting an aggregate \u201cemployment capacity\u201d via interest\u2010rate targets is safe and sufficient. Just as classical theorists erred by neglecting short\u2010run slumps, so vulgar Keynesians err by neglecting the Fed\u2019s misjudgments, lags, and distributional distortions. The debate over NAFTA and repeated calls for ever\u2010lower rates reveal the fragility of trusting the \u201cvisible hand.\u201d Our thesis\u2014\u201cSetting the employment capacity for the economy is dangerous\u201d\u2014best captures the systemic risk and fallacy the author warns about.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary  \nI maintain that the fallacy the author exposes is the internal contradiction of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d that claims (a) the Federal Reserve can always manage interest rates, yet (b) higher savings nevertheless depress investment and output. This self-contradiction collapses upon scrutiny and is the author\u2019s focal point. By contrast, the notion that the fallacy is merely \u201csetting the employment capacity for the economy in danger\u201d (Debater_B\u2019s position) misreads the text: the author explicitly praises the Fed\u2019s control over employment outcomes (\u201cvisible hand\u2026 pushing us toward\u2026 unemployment rate,\u201d <quote> here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be,</quote>) as restoring classical principles and rendering Keynesian paradoxes irrelevant.  \n\nI. The Author\u2019s Central Claim: Fed Control Makes Savings Harmless  \n1. \u201cInterest rates are independent of\u2026 employment\u201d only in crude Keynesian models; in reality \u201cthe Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou may quarrel\u2026 but you can hardly dispute his power\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n2. \u201cIf you want a simple model\u2026 the unemployment rate\u2026 will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cplus or minus a random error\u2026 he is not quite God\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n3. Therefore \u201can increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cSo all the paradoxes\u2026 become irrelevant\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n4. The author ridicules \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d who argue savings are bad despite conceding Fed power, calling their position self-refuting: either \u201cinterest rates have no effect\u201d (clearly false, as the homebuilders attest) or \u201cpotential savings\u2026 so high\u2026 Fed cannot bring the two in line\u201d (only plausible in a deep liquidity trap like 1930s or Japan). Neither condition applies to modern U.S. (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe bank that holds\u2026 assures me\u2026 interest rate\u2026 is quite positive\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\nII. The Fallacy Identified: Self-Contradiction in \u201cVulgar Keynesianism\u201d  \n1. The author challenges proponents to \u201cconvincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d if they wish to claim savings harm growth (<invalid_quote>\u201cTo justify\u2026 savings are actually bad\u2026 you must argue either that interest rates have no effect\u2026 or that potential savings\u2026 so high\u2026 Fed cannot\u2026 even at\u2026 near-zero\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n2. Yet the very same authors (e.g., Galbraith) demand \u201cstimulate growth by cutting interest rates,\u201d implicitly admitting rate cuts do induce investment (<quote> He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.</quote>). They cannot have it both ways.  \n\nIII. Debater_B\u2019s Position Misreads the Text  \n1. Claim: the fallacy is \u201cSetting the employment capacity\u2026 in danger.\u201d  \n   a. The author never criticizes any single \u201cemployment capacity\u201d target; rather he endorses Fed targeting (\u201cvisible hand\u2026 pushing us toward its estimate\u2026 end of story\u201d).  \n   b. His objection is solely to the na\u00efve view that \u201creduced consumer spending is always a bad thing\u201d when Fed can offset it.  \n2. Public debates on NAFTA ignore this Fed-offset point; author laments \u201cobvious\u2026 never made it into public consciousness\u201d (<quote>\"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\")</quote>). This shows the target is popular Keynesian caricatures, not Fed targeting.  \n\nIV. Supporting Evidence from Background Text  \n1. \u201cIn the long run we are all dead\u2026 if investment demand\u2026 falls\u2026 the result would be\u2026 slump\u201d (<invalid_quote>Keynes\u2019s short-run insight</invalid_quote>), but Fed overrides in practice.  \n2. \u201cFed can double the money supply in a day\u2026 level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go\u2014end of story.\u201d (<invalid_quote>author\u2019s analogy to gas pedal</invalid_quote>).  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s unambiguous argument is that \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d is internally inconsistent once one concedes the very Fed authority these Keynesians themselves invoke to justify rate cuts. This contradiction is the fallacy he exposes. Debater_B\u2019s interpretation has no grounding in the text: rather than criticizing Fed targets, the author upholds them and uses them to dissolve Keynesian paradoxes. Therefore the correct answer is indeed the inconsistency between Fed control of interest rates and the claim that increased savings depress growth.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

In the 1970s, Fed policy aiming for a low\u2010unemployment target led to runaway inflation, undermining \u201cnoninflationary unemployment\u201d and demonstrating the central\u2010planning fallacy.\n\nA3. Overlooks distributional and sectoral misallocations. Monetary policy cannot direct credit efficiently to productive uses; it encourages asset\u2010price inflation, housing bubbles, and malinvestment, ultimately undermining sustainable growth and full employment.  \n\nConclusion: The author\u2019s real \u201cfallacy\u201d is central\u2010planning hubris\u2014believing that setting an aggregate \u201cemployment capacity\u201d via interest\u2010rate targets is safe and sufficient. Just as classical theorists erred by neglecting short\u2010run slumps, so vulgar Keynesians err by neglecting the Fed\u2019s misjudgments, lags, and distributional distortions. The debate over NAFTA and repeated calls for ever\u2010lower rates reveal the fragility of trusting the \u201cvisible hand.\u201d Our thesis\u2014\u201cSetting the employment capacity for the economy is dangerous\u201d\u2014best captures the systemic risk and fallacy the author warns about.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument Summary  \nI defend that the author\u2019s exposed fallacy is the self-contradiction of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism,\u201d which simultaneously (a) accepts that the Fed \u201cactively manages interest rates\u201d and thus can always offset higher savings (<invalid_quote>\u201cFed can double the money supply in a day\u2026level of employment\u2026determined by how high he thinks it can safely go\u2014end of story.\u201d</invalid_quote>) and (b) insists \u201cforcing up savings\u2026is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment\u201d (<quote>commentary: Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy,</quote>)\u2014yet they still plead for rate cuts to stimulate growth (<quote> He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates. </quote>). This is the internal contradiction the author derides and challenges them to resolve (<invalid_quote>\u201cTo justify\u2026you must argue either that interest rates have no effect\u2026or that potential savings\u2026so high\u2026that the Fed cannot\u2026even at\u2026near-zero\u201d</invalid_quote>). Because modern U.S. rates are \u201cquite positive\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe bank\u2026assures me\u2026interest rate\u2026is quite positive\u201d</invalid_quote>), neither exception applies. By contrast, Debater_B\u2019s thesis\u2014that trusting the Fed \u201cvisible hand\u201d is inherently dangerous\u2014misreads the text, which consistently praises Fed control as restoring classical equilibria and rendering Keynesian paradoxes \u201cirrelevant\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cSo all the paradoxes\u2026become irrelevant.\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\nI. Author\u2019s Explicit Praise of Fed Authority  \n1. \u201cYou may quarrel with the Fed chairman\u2019s judgment\u2026but you can hardly dispute his power\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 11</invalid_quote>).  \n2. \u201cIf you want a simple model\u2026unemployment rate\u2026will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 11</invalid_quote>). This minor randomness is the only acknowledged limitation, not a condemnation of policy.  \n3. \u201cAll the paradoxes of thrift\u2026become irrelevant\u201d under Fed policy (<invalid_quote>para. 13</invalid_quote>). The author\u2019s entire critique of \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d depends on this efficacy.\n\nII. \u201cVulgar Keynesians\u201d Undermine Their Own Claim  \n1. Demand rate cuts to stimulate growth (<quote>Feb. 3 Business Week:  He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates. </quote>). If rate cuts truly offset higher savings, no reason to fear savings; if they do not, rate cuts would be ineffective too.  \n2. Declaring the Fed \u201call the Fed\u2019s fault\u201d in poor performance demonstrates they concede rate influence but blame miscalibration, not impotence (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe disappointing performance\u2026is all the Fed\u2019s fault\u201d</invalid_quote>). They thus imply the Fed\u2019s model is correct but misapplied, rather than invalid in principle.\n\nIII. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cDangerous Fed Targeting\u201d  \nB1: Minor randomness (\u201cnot quite God\u201d) is acknowledged but described as \u201crandom error,\u201d not systematic failure. The author does not dwell on deflationary traps in U.S. but only in Japan/1930s (<invalid_quote>\u201cit is arguable\u2026for Japan\u2026where interest rates are about 1 percent\u201d</invalid_quote>), conceding that only near-zero rates limit policy. U.S. rates are well above zero, so policy is effective.  \nB2: Lags and misallocation? The author\u2019s model is \u201csimple\u201d and \u201centirely reasonable\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 14</invalid_quote>); complexity does not negate the core truth that central banks can steer aggregate demand. Misallocations concern micro\u2010efficiency, not the macro fallacy of fearing higher savings.  \nB3: Public ignorance of Fed-offset point is lamented (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe obvious\u2026never made it into the public consciousness\u201d</invalid_quote>), showing the author\u2019s frustration that vulgar Keynesian caricatures persist despite clear Fed power. If he distrusted Fed targeting, he would celebrate public\u2019s focus on spending, not bemoan it.  \nB4: No call for stricter Fed restraint or alternative policy in U.S.; only for more Fed activism: He urges rate cuts to boost Japan and supports Fed loosening to absorb higher savings. If Fed control were dangerous, he would not recommend it.\n\nIV. Why Debater_B\u2019s Interpretation Fails  \n1. Misreads \u201crandom error\u201d as fatally undermining Fed policy; author treats it as minor noise.  \n2. Ignores explicit authorial challenge to show Fed impotence before condemning higher savings.  \n3. Overlooks that only in \u201cliquidity trap\u201d does he admit Fed cannot offset; he never applies that to U.S. Similarly, he endorses Fed-targeting to neutralize paradoxes everywhere else.  \n4. The debate over NAFTA focused on jobs because the public lacks understanding of Fed authority; author scolds such \u201cpractical men\u201d for slavish adherence to defunct Keynesian caricatures (<quote>influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It</quote>).\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s precise target is the logical incoherence of accepting Fed omnipotence while simultaneously fearing higher savings\u2014a contradiction only resolved by conceding Fed impotence, which he challenges and systematically rejects for modern economies. Debater_B\u2019s claim that Fed targeting is inherently dangerous is neither the author\u2019s view nor supported in the text. Therefore the correct fallacy is the self-contradiction in \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d regarding Fed control and savings.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument Summary (Debater_B): The author\u2019s true \u201cfallacy\u201d warning is against overreliance on the Fed\u2019s ability to pick and safely maintain an optimal unemployment (employment capacity). Trusting a fallible, lagged, and politically driven institution to stabilize aggregate demand invites miscalibration, liquidity traps, asset bubbles, and policy failure\u2014just as \u201cclassical\u201d faith in the invisible hand failed in the Depression. My position explains why \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d still clamor for rate cuts after decades of underperformance, and why modern public debate ignores the Fed offset in practice.\n\nI. The Author\u2019s Own Language Frames Fed Targeting as Risky  \n1. \u201cPlus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that [the Fed chairman] is not quite God\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 11</invalid_quote>)  \n   \u2013 Acknowledges that rate\u2010setting is imprecise and fallible. Why then presume it can absorb every shock?  \n2. \u201cIt is arguable\u2026 for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 18</invalid_quote>)  \n   \u2013 Even at near\u2010zero rates, policy can fail, leading to deflation and stagnation. That scenario \u201crestores\u201d classical theory only when central banks \u201cfail\u201d or refuse to act, showing policy is neither omnipotent nor unambiguously benign.  \n3. \u201cFed can double the money supply in a day\u2026level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go\u2014end of story\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 13</invalid_quote>)  \n   \u2013 \u201cSafely\u201d implies caution; the Fed must under\u2010shoot to avoid inflation, leaving persistent slumps. The lag between policy and effect injects volatility and uncertainty.\n\nII. Empirical and Theoretical Failures of Central\u2010Bank Targeting  \n1. Liquidity Traps and Effective Lower Bound  \n   \u2013 1930s U.S. and 1990s\u20132000s Japan experienced prolonged slumps despite near-zero rates; only unconventional policies (quantitative easing, fiscal stimulus) restored growth. Thus \u201cvisible hand\u201d is no cure\u2010all.  \n2. Stagflation of the 1970s (<absent_quote but widely known>)  \n   \u2013 Fed attempts to maintain low unemployment produced runaway inflation until policy snapped the economy into recession, showing targeting is a blunt instrument.  \n3. Asset Bubbles and Malinvestment  \n   \u2013 Repeated calls for lower rates after dot\u2010com and housing busts (<quote>Feb. 3 Business Week</quote>, <invalid_quote>para. 20</invalid_quote>) encourage unsustainable credit expansions that later collapse, causing deeper slumps.\n\nIII. Why Keynesians Demand Rate Cuts If Fed Is Omnipotent  \n1. \u201cSome contrarian economists\u2026 forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy\u2026 \u2018You need to stimulate\u2026the Fed.\u2019\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 20</invalid_quote>)  \n   \u2013 If Fed control were sufficient, no one would urge more easing; persistent calls for stimulus reveal chronic underperformance and miscalibration.  \n2. Public fixation on \u201cjob creation or destruction\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 15</invalid_quote>)  \n   \u2013 If Fed targeting truly dominated, the NAFTA debate would center on \u201clet the Fed absorb shocks,\u201d yet policy fears and political pressures confine debate to micro\u2010effects, betraying lack of confidence in central planning.\n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Claims  \nA1. Misreads Author\u2019s Praise of Fed Policy  \n   \u2013 Debater_A cites \u201cvisible hand\u201d language (<invalid_quote>paras. 12\u201313</invalid_quote>) but ignores the author\u2019s repeated emphasis on \u201crandom error\u201d and \u201carguable\u201d failures. Praise is conditional: \u201cas it thinks employment is too low\u2026 as it thinks the economy is overheating.\u201d Faulty judgments lead to cycles of boom and bust, not stable full employment.  \nB1. \u201cEnd of story\u201d Is Irony, Not Prescription  \n   \u2013 The author\u2019s tone is satirical: mocking \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d caricatures, not celebrating Fed omnipotence. The analogy to a driver with imperfect vision acknowledges that mistakes will be made. We are \u201call dead\u201d if we wait, but must accept occasional slumps.  \nC1. Contradiction within \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d Undermines Their Own Theory  \n   \u2013 They admit Fed impotence by appealing to fiscal stimulus when rates hit the zero bound; they see Japan\u2019s passivity as \u201cgross malfeasance\u201d (<invalid_quote>para. 18</invalid_quote>), advocating activism\u2014but Fed activism itself creates moral hazard and misallocation, reinforcing my fallacy claim.  \n\nV. The Genuine Fallacy: Central\u2010Planning Hubris  \n1. Overconfidence in a single instrument to manage complex, heterogenous markets overlooks distributional distortions and sectoral misalignments (housing vs. technology vs. services).  \n2. Ignores political economy: The Fed faces pressures to curb inflation, raising rates prematurely and choking recovery.  \n3. Marginal utility of consumption vs. investment varies over time; a one\u2010size\u2010fits\u2010all rate cannot optimize across all states of the business cycle.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s warning is against trusting the Fed\u2019s \u201cvisible hand\u201d to absorb demand shocks and set \u201cemployment capacity\u201d safely. Empirical history of liquidity traps, stagflation, policy lags, and repeated calls for further easing by Keynesians themselves demonstrate that central\u2010bank targeting is neither precise nor risk\u2010free. My interpretation captures the nuanced skepticism in the background text, while Debater_A\u2019s \u201cself\u2010contradiction\u201d theory ignores the author\u2019s own admissions of error and elevates one policy tool above all others. The real fallacy is hubristic reliance on policy to control aggregate outcomes\u2014exactly what \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d repeats ad nauseam.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
