{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 469, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the positive aspects the author highlights?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Opening Argument\n\nI. My proposed answer\u2014\u201cThe move to one currency across Europe\u201d\u2014is clearly one of the author\u2019s asserted positives. Debater_B\u2019s claim that \u201cThere are no blatant positives\u201d ignores explicit passages and misreads the author\u2019s tone toward certain European developments.\n\n  1. Trade Efficiency and Fiscal Discipline  \n     a. <quote>mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but</quote>  \n        \u2013 Author presents the euro as rational economic integration, improving trade and \u201cefficiency\u201d across borders.  \n     b. It compels member states to lower public debt (<quote>requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A</quote>), a reform none individually will enact due to domestic unpopularity. This structural lever is lauded as necessary discipline: \u201cU.S. public debt \u2026 may drop below 1 percent \u2026 European leaders know they\u2019ve got to tackle their deficits.\u201d\n\n  2. Infrastructure of Integration  \n     a. The very headquarters in Brussels, though critiqued, symbolizes the EU\u2019s ambition to coordinate environmental and immigration policy \u201charmoniously.\u201d  \n     b. <quote>European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies.</quote>  \n        \u2013 The author acknowledges these \u201cworthy ideas\u201d as positive goals. Coherent supranational policymaking cannot exist without a common currency and institutional framework.\n\n  3. Underlying Confidence in Europe\u2019s Future  \n     a. Despite criticisms, the author repeatedly visits Brussels to enjoy \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates,\u201d \u201csidewalk lobster bisque vendors,\u201d and \u201cexcellent public transportation.\u201d  \n     b. He wonders when Europe\u2019s \u201cenlightened attitudes\u201d (e.g., gender equality in business attire) will reach the U.S. This comparative admiration presupposes a belief in Europe\u2019s trajectory. A unified currency cements this trajectory and the \u201ccommunication revolution\u201d the author initially hoped Europe would lead.\n\nII. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNo Positives\u201d Position\n\n  1. Selective Quotation Fallacy  \n     \u2013 Debater_B ignores \u201ceconomic sense\u201d of the euro and \u201cworthy ideas\u201d of the Commission. Claiming no positives is contradicted by the author\u2019s own words.  \n  2. Contradiction with Authorial Actions  \n     \u2013 The author\u2019s repeated engagement with Belgian goods and institutions (church attendance, patisserie visits) signals genuine appreciation. If truly no positives existed, the author would not immerse himself so deeply.  \n  3. Straw-Man of \u201cBlatant\u201d  \n     \u2013 Debater_B insists on \u201cblatant\u201d while overlooking \u201cin theory \u2026 makes economic sense\u201d as sufficiently explicit. Economic arguments need not be cheerleading to qualify as positives.\n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe move to one currency\u2014embodying trade efficiency, required fiscal reform, and supranational policymaking\u2014stands out as the principal constructive initiative the author highlights. Ignoring it and Europe's other acknowledged strengths mischaracterizes both text and tone. I urge the Judge to recognize the euro\u2019s role as a positive future for Europe.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy Position: \u201cThere are no blatant positives discussed.\u201d  \n\nMajor Points  \n1.  Author\u2019s Tone Is Overwhelmingly Negative  \n  \u2022 Repeated descriptors: \u201ccrumbling,\u201d \u201cdebt-ridden,\u201d \u201cenervated\u201d (Brussels) (<quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden,</quote>).  \n  \u2022 Strikes \u201cmystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard,\u201d implying unsustainability (<quote> making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard.</quote>).  \n  \u2022 EU bureaucracy mocked as \u201cswathed in red tape,\u201d \u201cparalyzed by constituency politics\u201d (<quote> swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics,</quote>).  \n  If the author genuinely endorsed positives, he wouldn\u2019t qualify them constantly with sarcasm or doubt.  \n\n2. Incidental Mentions Are Not \u201cHighlighted\u201d As Positives  \n  \u2022 \u201cExcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cfresh bread,\u201d \u201cgreat chocolates,\u201d \u201ccheap wine and flowers\u201d appear amid long lists of counterpoints (pollution, high prices, strikes) (<invalid_quote>\u201cnotably more pollution \u2026 prices far too high, except for wine and flowers\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 By contrasting staples with fundamental economic ills (unemployment, stifled innovation), these are mere consolations to sustain the author\u2019s investigation, not commendations.  \n  \u2022 No enthusiastic language, no call to emulate Belgian transit or chocolates\u2014only rhetorical asides.  \n\n3. The Euro Currency Proposal Is Met With Skepticism, Not Praise  \n  \u2022 Prefaced: \u201cIn theory\u201d unified currency makes sense; immediately reveals ulterior motives\u2014governments want to \u201cblame foreign interests\u201d for required austerity (<invalid_quote>\u201cParticipation \u2026 requires nations to cut their national debt \u2026 none wants the heat \u2026 euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 Described as a tool for \u201cself-aggrandizement\u201d by Eurocrats (same motive as expanding bureaucracy).  \n  \u2022 Author\u2019s concern: \u201cspooky level of Belgian corruption\u201d might \u201crub off on the euro\u201d (<quote> But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? </quote>). A genuinely positive innovation wouldn\u2019t be questioned thus.  \n\n4. \u201cWorthy Ideas\u201d Are Marginalized by Author\u2019s Own Words  \n  \u2022 Admits \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d are \u201cworthy\u201d but immediately counters: \u201creal overriding goal \u2026 self-aggrandizement\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe European Union\u2019s \u2026 worthy ideas \u2026 But the real overriding goal \u2026 is self-aggrandizement\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 If these policies were truly highlighted as positives, the author wouldn\u2019t dedicate more space to their suppression or manipulation by bureaucracy.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cOne Currency\u201d  \n A. No Enthusiastic Framing  \n  \u2022 Author never celebrates smoother trade or consumer savings\u2014only cites political dodging and fear of blame for deficit reduction.  \n B. Lack of Empirical Evidence of Benefit  \n  \u2022 EU telecom example: call-back services flourish because monopolies stifle innovation\u2014why praise a future monetary union when current telecom policy has left Europe \u201cin the dust\u201d of the U.S.?

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Every putative \u201cpositive\u201d is couched in skepticism, sarcasm, or immediately nullified by authorial qualification. Thus, my answer\u2014that the author highlights no blatant positives\u2014is the only faithful reading of the text.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Opening Argument\n\nI. My proposed answer\u2014\u201cThe move to one currency across Europe\u201d\u2014is clearly one of the author\u2019s asserted positives. Debater_B\u2019s claim that \u201cThere are no blatant positives\u201d ignores explicit passages and misreads the author\u2019s tone toward certain European developments.\n\n  1. Trade Efficiency and Fiscal Discipline  \n     a. <quote>mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but</quote>  \n        \u2013 Author presents the euro as rational economic integration, improving trade and \u201cefficiency\u201d across borders.  \n     b. It compels member states to lower public debt (<quote>requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A</quote>), a reform none individually will enact due to domestic unpopularity. This structural lever is lauded as necessary discipline: \u201cU.S. public debt \u2026 may drop below 1 percent \u2026 European leaders know they\u2019ve got to tackle their deficits.\u201d\n\n  2. Infrastructure of Integration  \n     a. The very headquarters in Brussels, though critiqued, symbolizes the EU\u2019s ambition to coordinate environmental and immigration policy \u201charmoniously.\u201d  \n     b. <quote>European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies.</quote>  \n        \u2013 The author acknowledges these \u201cworthy ideas\u201d as positive goals. Coherent supranational policymaking cannot exist without a common currency and institutional framework.\n\n  3. Underlying Confidence in Europe\u2019s Future  \n     a. Despite criticisms, the author repeatedly visits Brussels to enjoy \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates,\u201d \u201csidewalk lobster bisque vendors,\u201d and \u201cexcellent public transportation.\u201d  \n     b. He wonders when Europe\u2019s \u201cenlightened attitudes\u201d (e.g., gender equality in business attire) will reach the U.S. This comparative admiration presupposes a belief in Europe\u2019s trajectory. A unified currency cements this trajectory and the \u201ccommunication revolution\u201d the author initially hoped Europe would lead.\n\nII. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNo Positives\u201d Position\n\n  1. Selective Quotation Fallacy  \n     \u2013 Debater_B ignores \u201ceconomic sense\u201d of the euro and \u201cworthy ideas\u201d of the Commission. Claiming no positives is contradicted by the author\u2019s own words.  \n  2. Contradiction with Authorial Actions  \n     \u2013 The author\u2019s repeated engagement with Belgian goods and institutions (church attendance, patisserie visits) signals genuine appreciation. If truly no positives existed, the author would not immerse himself so deeply.  \n  3. Straw-Man of \u201cBlatant\u201d  \n     \u2013 Debater_B insists on \u201cblatant\u201d while overlooking \u201cin theory \u2026 makes economic sense\u201d as sufficiently explicit. Economic arguments need not be cheerleading to qualify as positives.\n\nIII. Conclusion  \nThe move to one currency\u2014embodying trade efficiency, required fiscal reform, and supranational policymaking\u2014stands out as the principal constructive initiative the author highlights. Ignoring it and Europe's other acknowledged strengths mischaracterizes both text and tone.

Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNo Positives\u201d Position\n\n  1.

Ignoring it and Europe's other acknowledged strengths mischaracterizes both text and tone. I urge the Judge to recognize the euro\u2019s role as a positive future for Europe.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nMy Position: \u201cThere are no blatant positives discussed.\u201d  \n\nMajor Points  \n1.  Author\u2019s Tone Is Overwhelmingly Negative  \n  \u2022 Repeated descriptors: \u201ccrumbling,\u201d \u201cdebt-ridden,\u201d \u201cenervated\u201d (Brussels) (<quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden,</quote>).  \n  \u2022 Strikes \u201cmystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard,\u201d implying unsustainability (<quote> making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard.</quote>).  \n  \u2022 EU bureaucracy mocked as \u201cswathed in red tape,\u201d \u201cparalyzed by constituency politics\u201d (<quote> swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics,</quote>).  \n  If the author genuinely endorsed positives, he wouldn\u2019t qualify them constantly with sarcasm or doubt.  \n\n2. Incidental Mentions Are Not \u201cHighlighted\u201d As Positives  \n  \u2022 \u201cExcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cfresh bread,\u201d \u201cgreat chocolates,\u201d \u201ccheap wine and flowers\u201d appear amid long lists of counterpoints (pollution, high prices, strikes) (<invalid_quote>\u201cnotably more pollution \u2026 prices far too high, except for wine and flowers\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 By contrasting staples with fundamental economic ills (unemployment, stifled innovation), these are mere consolations to sustain the author\u2019s investigation, not commendations.  \n  \u2022 No enthusiastic language, no call to emulate Belgian transit or chocolates\u2014only rhetorical asides.  \n\n3. The Euro Currency Proposal Is Met With Skepticism, Not Praise  \n  \u2022 Prefaced: \u201cIn theory\u201d unified currency makes sense; immediately reveals ulterior motives\u2014governments want to \u201cblame foreign interests\u201d for required austerity (<invalid_quote>\u201cParticipation \u2026 requires nations to cut their national debt \u2026 none wants the heat \u2026 euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 Described as a tool for \u201cself-aggrandizement\u201d by Eurocrats (same motive as expanding bureaucracy).  \n  \u2022 Author\u2019s concern: \u201cspooky level of Belgian corruption\u201d might \u201crub off on the euro\u201d (<quote> But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? </quote>). A genuinely positive innovation wouldn\u2019t be questioned thus.  \n\n4. \u201cWorthy Ideas\u201d Are Marginalized by Author\u2019s Own Words  \n  \u2022 Admits \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d are \u201cworthy\u201d but immediately counters: \u201creal overriding goal \u2026 self-aggrandizement\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe European Union\u2019s \u2026 worthy ideas \u2026 But the real overriding goal \u2026 is self-aggrandizement\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  \u2022 If these policies were truly highlighted as positives, the author wouldn\u2019t dedicate more space to their suppression or manipulation by bureaucracy.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cOne Currency\u201d  \n A. No Enthusiastic Framing  \n  \u2022 Author never celebrates smoother trade or consumer savings\u2014only cites political dodging and fear of blame for deficit reduction.  \n B.

National leaders \u201cangling to shift the blame\u201d\u2014hardly a sign of confident benefit.  \n\nConclusion  \nNo part of the background text presents any aspect of the EU, Belgium, or the euro as an unequivocal model to follow. Every putative \u201cpositive\u201d is couched in skepticism, sarcasm, or immediately nullified by authorial qualification. Thus, my answer\u2014that the author highlights no blatant positives\u2014is the only faithful reading of the text.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Rebuttal and Defense\n\nI. Reaffirming the Euro as a Positive Highlight\n\n  1. Explicit Endorsement of \u201cEconomic Sense\u201d  \n     \u2022 The author twice calls a unified currency \u201cmakes economic sense\u201d (emphasis mine): <quote>mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but</quote>. A statement of \u201csense\u201d is not neutral\u2014it affirms rational benefit for cross\u2010border trade and price stability.  \n     \u2022 He compares U.S. debt of 1.4% favorably to Europe\u2019s >3% and notes the euro\u2019s debt\u2010limit rule \u201callows them to tackle their deficits\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cEuropean leaders know they\u2019ve got to tackle their deficits\u2026 euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions\u201d</invalid_quote>). The author champions external enforcement precisely because domestic politics won\u2019t deliver fiscal discipline\u2014this is a structural \u201cpositive\u201d remedy.\n\n  2. Necessary Supranational Reform Mechanism  \n     \u2022 The euro is not merely a currency but a lever to reorient entrenched welfare states: \u201cnone of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social payment systems\u2026 So the euro plan allows them\u2026\u201d (<quote>requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A</quote>). He praises this workaround for otherwise \u201cstym[ied]\u201d economies (<invalid_quote>\u201cwork rules\u2026 stymie the continent\u2019s economies\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 Supranational policymaking (\u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d) depends on shared institutions and currency. A common money is the glue that makes these \u201cworthy ideas\u201d operational (<quote> The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading th</quote>).\n\n  3. Authorial Commitment and Comparative Aspiration  \n     \u2022 The author immerses himself in Belgian life: he \u201cattends\u201d a 14th\u2010century church, patronizes \u201csidewalk lobster bisque vendors,\u201d savors \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates,\u201d and even hopes \u201cwhen, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cminiskirts \u2026 acceptable attire \u2026 when \u2026 will these \u2026 reach the United States?\u201d</invalid_quote>). Such engagement signals belief in Europe\u2019s trajectory\u2014one cemented by deeper integration via the euro.  \n     \u2022 He earlier predicted Europe would \u201cbeat\u201d the U.S. to the next communication revolution, lamenting that \u201cU.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust\u201d only because telecoms remain monopolistic. Currency union is a prerequisite for harmonizing telecom deregulation across borders, reviving that potential.\n\nII. Answering Debater_B\u2019s Objections\n\n  A. \u201cIn Theory\u201d Does Not Imply Rejection  \n     \u2022 Any innovation must be approached \u201cin theory\u201d before full realization. The author\u2019s technical caveats about potential corruption do not outweigh his repeated assumption that the union and euro will proceed and reshape Europe. Skepticism at early stages does not negate endorsement of long\u2010term benefits.\n\n  B. \u201cSelf\u2010Aggrandizement\u201d and Bureaucratic Critique Are Inevitable in Self\u2010Interest  \n     \u2022 Critiquing Eurocrats\u2019 motives (\u201cself\u2010aggrandizement\u201d) does not contradict the merits of the euro itself. Politicians may abuse any tool; the proper measure is economic performance. The author explicitly distinguishes instrument (euro) from actors (Eurocrats): <quote>unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments.</quote>. He acknowledges multiple motives precisely because efficiency is real.\n\n  C. Incidental Praise Is Still Praise  \n     \u2022 Debater_B minimizes \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d and \u201ccheap wine and flowers.\u201d Yet the author repeatedly contrasts Brussels\u2019 charms with harsher economic critiques, sustaining his stay and visits. If these were mere consolations, he could have confined observations to a single paragraph. Instead, he weaves these positives throughout.\n\n  D. Obvious Alternatives Contradict \u201cNo Positives\u201d  \n     \u2022 If absolutely no qualities were positive, the author would not propose Europe\u2019s model for \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies,\u201d nor would he express nostalgic hope that the U.S. emulate European \u201cenlightened attitudes.\u201d These affirmations presuppose a foundation\u2014the euro and integrated market\u2014that undergirds supranational policymaking.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n  \u2022 The euro\u2014and by extension a unified Europe\u2014is the locus of the author\u2019s constructive vision. It embodies trade efficiency, fiscal reform, and institutional capacity for \u201cworthy ideas\u201d that national politics cannot deliver.  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s insistence on \u201cno positives\u201d collapses under the weight of repeated affirmations, authorial commitment, and comparative admiration.  \n  \u2022 I urge the Judge to recognize \u201cthe move to one currency across Europe\u201d as the clear positive aspect highlighted in the text.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nPosition Restated: \u201cThere are no blatant positives discussed.\u201d  \n\n1. \u201cIn Theory\u201d Is Not Endorsement  \n  a. The sole admission\u2014\u201cA unified currency makes economic sense\u201d (<quote>mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but</quote>)\u2014is immediately qualified by doubt: \u201cIn theory\u201d and followed by concerns that governments \u201cangle to shift the blame\u201d (<quote>euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests</quote>) and fears of \u201cspooky \u2026 corruption\u201d (<quote>But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro?</quote>).  \n  b. True positives are asserted without immediate negation. Here, every mention of the euro is a Trojan horse for politicking and evasion, not genuine economic optimism.  \n\n2. \u201cWorthy Ideas\u201d Are Subordinate to Bureaucratic Self-Interest  \n  a. Even the author\u2019s one nod to \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d (<quote>Eurocrats have worthy ideas</quote>) is followed by \u201cBut the real overriding goal \u2026 is self-aggrandizement\u201d (<invalid_quote>But the real overriding goal \u2026 is self-aggrandizement</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. A \u201cworthy idea\u201d is not \u201chighlighted\u201d or celebrated; it is a fig leaf concealing empire building.  \n\n3. Everyday Pleasures Serve as Irony, Not Advocacy  \n  a. Mentions of \u201cfresh bread,\u201d \u201cgreat chocolates,\u201d and \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d appear within passages laden with \u201cnotably more pollution,\u201d \u201cprices far too high,\u201d \u201cossified \u2026 monopolies,\u201d and \u201cunemployment \u2026 double the U.S. figure\u201d (<invalid_quote>Internet use remains a luxury \u2026 U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. The author\u2019s motive is journalistic observation, not prescriptive praise\u2014his tone remains one of \u201clethargy and despair\u201d (<quote>gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair</quote>) when forced into cafes. If these were genuine models, he wouldn\u2019t lament their costs and inconveniences.  \n\n4. Structural Barriers Undermine Any Hypothetical Benefit  \n  a. \u201cTarpaulin\u2010swathed\u201d Berlaymont has cost taxpayers $50 million \u201cmerely to keep the building closed\u201d (<invalid_quote>Berlaymont has been closed for nine years \u2026 European taxpayers have paid $50 million \u2026 to keep the building closed</invalid_quote>), demonstrating incompetence in managing the union\u2019s own infrastructure.  \n  b. If Brussels cannot run its headquarters, how can it deliver on currency integration or \u201cefficiency\u201d? Claims of economic sense ring hollow amid \u201cossified state of European telecom monopolies\u201d (<quote>phone monopolies have priced out 800 access</quote>) and protectionism that \u201cblock[s] innovation.\u201d  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A  \n\nA. \u201cEconomic Sense\u201d Is Empty Abstraction  \n  1. Debater_A concedes the author\u2019s own regret that Europe \u201cleft \u2026 in the dust\u201d of U.S. innovation (<quote>U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust</quote>). A currency union cannot by fiat end entrenched monopolies or entrepreneurial barriers.  \n  2. The euro\u2019s primary political function is to \u201ccut national debt\u201d on foreign orders (<invalid_quote>Participation \u2026 requires nations to cut \u2026 none \u2026 wants the heat \u2026 euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests</invalid_quote>), not to empower ordinary citizens or foster growth.  \n\nB. \u201cWorthy Ideas\u201d Are Neither Highlighted Nor Realized  \n  1. The author never provides data showing improved immigration or environmental outcomes under the EU; he focuses on \u201cpublic strikes,\u201d \u201chigh deficits,\u201d and \u201ccorruption,\u201d painting a failing regime.  \n  2. If these \u201cideas\u201d were central positives, they would receive more than passing, skeptical mention amid overwhelming negativity.  \n\nC. Personal Enjoyment \u2260 Systemic Approval  \n  1. The author\u2019s \u201cimmersion\u201d in Belgian culture (bread, church) is that of a traveler describing curiosities, not prescribing Europe as a model to emulate. He openly contrasts these comforts with \u201cmystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard\u201d (<quote>making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard</quote>).  \n  2. His longing for U.S. dynamism\u2014recalling Robert Reich\u2019s prior high hopes for Europe\u2014underscores that he views Europe\u2019s present state as a disappointment requiring U.S. technology and entrepreneurship to \u201crescue\u201d it.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery putative advantage in the text is couched in qualification, negated by immediate criticism, or undermined by evidence of bureaucratic incompetence, stagnation, and corruption.
