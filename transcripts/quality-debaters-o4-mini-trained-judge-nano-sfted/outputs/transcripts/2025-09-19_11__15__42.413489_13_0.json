That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n",

And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat were some of the reported events that the author brings up to justify Nash\u2019s undoing?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Lewd public conduct, nudity, violence, communications with extraterrestrials\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Sending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Sending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Opening Argument\n\n1.

(<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>)  \n\n3. Why \u201caliens\u201d or \u201cextraterrestrials\u201d are not primary undoing events  \n  \u2022 Delusional belief vs. socially sanctionable acts. His \u201cencrypted messages\u201d from aliens in the New York Times (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>) were symptoms of schizophrenia, not grounds for expulsion or legal action.  \n  \u2022 Neither university nor Rand penalized him for mere delusions; they responded to actual indecent exposure and security risks (bombs, lewd acts).  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B (\u201calien messages,\u201d violence in game-theory presentations)  \n  a. \u201cViolence\u201d in lectures (\u201cfarrago of mathematical lunacy\u201d at Columbia) (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>) reflects intellectual incoherence, not punishable offense. He retained academic positions thereafter until public sexual misconduct.  \n  b. Alien communications did not trigger psychiatric hospitalization until his behavior became extreme and criminal. Pleuripotent genetics may explain his mental illness, but institutions cannot intervene on thought alone.  \n\n5. Logical coherence  \n  \u2022 Social and legal institutions require observable acts to \u201cundo\u201d a career.  \n  \u2022 Bomb-making and lewd public conduct are documented, objective events that led to his expulsion from Rand, ostracism at MIT, and eventual institutionalization.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly the triad of bomb-making, public indecency (nudity, lewd conduct, violence) meet the standard of \u201creported events\u2026 to justify Nash\u2019s undoing.\u201d Alien delusions and mathematical incoherence alone neither prompted expulsion nor arrest. They were treated medically; he resumed academic life once behavior normalized.  \nTherefore, my answer \u201cSending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct\u201d correctly identifies the causative events.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Position: The author identifies four key classes of aberrant behavior\u2014lewd public conduct, nudity, violence, and bizarre \u201cextraterrestrial\u201d communications\u2014that mark Nash\u2019s descent into madness.  \nArguments for Our Answer  \n1. Lewd Public Conduct  \n  a. \u201cExpelled from Rand \u2026 after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men\u2019s room\u201d (age ~30) marks the official professional undoing. <invalid_quote>\u201cexpelled \u2026 after \u2026 a lewd act in a public men\u2019s room\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. \u201cCarried on \u2026 odd packages \u2026 aliens \u2026 thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through [the New York Times]\u201d betrays his delusional public fixation. <quote> thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages </quote>  \n\n2.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat were some of the reported events that the author brings up to justify Nash\u2019s undoing?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Sending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Lewd public conduct, nudity, violence, communications with extraterrestrials\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Lewd public conduct, nudity, violence, communications with extraterrestrials\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Position: The author identifies four key classes of aberrant behavior\u2014lewd public conduct, nudity, violence, and bizarre \u201cextraterrestrial\u201d communications\u2014that mark Nash\u2019s descent into madness.  \nArguments for Our Answer  \n1. Lewd Public Conduct  \n  a. \u201cExpelled from Rand \u2026 after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men\u2019s room\u201d (age ~30) marks the official professional undoing. <invalid_quote>\u201cexpelled \u2026 after \u2026 a lewd act in a public men\u2019s room\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. \u201cCarried on \u2026 odd packages \u2026 aliens \u2026 thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through [the New York Times]\u201d betrays his delusional public fixation. <quote> thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages </quote>  \n\n2. Public Nudity  \n  a. \u201cShowed up for an MIT New Year\u2019s Eve party clad only in a diaper,\u201d a classic sign of psychotic disinhibition. <quote> clad only in a diaper.</quote>  \n  b. Chess prodigies\u2019 \u201cproclivity for disrobing \u2026 I learned this \u2026\u201d situates nudity as symptomatic of the same folie \u00e0 deux. <quote> disrobing on public buses)</quote>  \n\n3. Violence  \n  a. Assault on his wife Alicia: \u201cOnce \u2026 he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat.\u201d This personal violence reflects both paranoia and loss of social cognition. <quote> put his foot on her throat.</quote>  \n  b. Threat to national security through repeated attempts to \u201cform a world government\u201d and \u201crenounce U.S. citizenship,\u201d actions that prevented academic reappointment and led to asylum stays.  \n\n4. Extraterrestrial Delusions  \n  a. He \u201cbelieved himself to be \u2026 \u2018epicenter of the universe\u2019\u201d and received \u201cencrypted messages\u201d from aliens via the New York Times\u2014hallmarks of grandiose, persecutory delusion. <quote>\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"</quote>  \n  b. His public Columbia lecture on the Riemann Zeta conjecture was \u201ca farrago of mathematical lunacy,\u201d fueled by his conviction that solving it would stave off decline\u2014a delusional overreach that culminated in disgrace. <invalid_quote>\u201cNash\u2019s talk \u2026 was horrible\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\nObjections to Debater_A (\u201cBombs, Nudity, Lewd Public Conduct\u201d)  \n1. Childhood Bomb-Making vs. Adult Madness  \n  \u2022 Bomb-building with peers and animal torture occurred in his \u201cboy\u201d days in West Virginia, long before his \u201cbig breakdown\u201d at age 30. These youthful misdeeds were neither professional nor symptomatic of schizophrenia, but of adolescent mischief. <invalid_quote>\u201cAs a boy \u2026 building homemade bombs\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 The author never cites bomb-making as grounds for expulsion from Rand or as evidence of psychosis.  \n\n2. Omission of Core Delusions  \n  \u2022 Debater_A neglects his \u201cextraterrestrial\u201d encrypted-message delusions, repeatedly emphasized as central psychotic phenomena.  \n  \u2022 The public diapery nudity and the Columbia lecture fiasco are both post-30 events but \u201cbombs\u201d played no role at these stages.  \n\n3. Violence Alone Is Insufficient Without Delusional Context  \n  \u2022 While Debater_A lists violence, they fail to connect it to the core delusional framework (grandiosity, persecution). Our inclusion of violence reinforces the pattern of psychosis when combined with public disinhibition and delusions.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly the quartet of lewd conduct, nudity, violence, and extraterrestrial communications together match the author\u2019s depiction of Nash\u2019s professional expulsion and multi-decade asylum trajectory. Excluding delusional \u201calien\u201d messages or violence fails to capture the full pleiotropic madness that \u201cundoes\u201d a once-genius career.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Opening Argument\n\n1. My Position  \nI answer that Nash\u2019s \u201cundoing\u201d was precipitated by concrete, socially unacceptable behaviors\u2014not merely idiosyncratic beliefs\u2014namely  \n  a. Constructing and sending bombs as a boy  \n  b. Lewd public conduct and sexual aggression  \n  c. Public nudity  \n\n2. Supporting Evidence  \n  \u2022 Childhood bomb-making:  \n    \u2013 \u201cAs a boy\u2026 building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast.\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>)  \n    \u2013 The FBI\u2010relevant suspicion: \u201cit\u2019s a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>)  \n  \u2022 Lewd sexual behavior:  \n    \u2013 \u201cExpelled from Rand as a security risk\u2026 caught\u2026 engaging in a lewd act in a public men\u2019s room near Muscle Beach.\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>)  \n    \u2013 Domestic violence: \u201che threw [his wife] to the ground and put his foot on her throat.\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>)  \n    \u2013 Abandonment of wife and child: refusal to support his son. (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>)  \n  \u2022 Public nudity:  \n    \u2013 \u201cNash showed up for an MIT New Year\u2019s Eve party clad only in a diaper.\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>)  \n    \u2013 Disrobing in public is a recognized sign of \u2018incipient insanity\u2019. (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>)  \n\n3. Why \u201caliens\u201d or \u201cextraterrestrials\u201d are not primary undoing events  \n  \u2022 Delusional belief vs. socially sanctionable acts. His \u201cencrypted messages\u201d from aliens in the New York Times (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>) were symptoms of schizophrenia, not grounds for expulsion or legal action.  \n  \u2022 Neither university nor Rand penalized him for mere delusions; they responded to actual indecent exposure and security risks (bombs, lewd acts).  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B (\u201calien messages,\u201d violence in game-theory presentations)  \n  a. \u201cViolence\u201d in lectures (\u201cfarrago of mathematical lunacy\u201d at Columbia) (<invalid_quote>Background</invalid_quote>) reflects intellectual incoherence, not punishable offense. He retained academic positions thereafter until public sexual misconduct.  \n  b. Alien communications did not trigger psychiatric hospitalization until his behavior became extreme and criminal. Pleuripotent genetics may explain his mental illness, but institutions cannot intervene on thought alone.  \n\n5. Logical coherence  \n  \u2022 Social and legal institutions require observable acts to \u201cundo\u201d a career.  \n  \u2022 Bomb-making and lewd public conduct are documented, objective events that led to his expulsion from Rand, ostracism at MIT, and eventual institutionalization.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly the triad of bomb-making, public indecency (nudity, lewd conduct, violence) meet the standard of \u201creported events\u2026 to justify Nash\u2019s undoing.\u201d Alien delusions and mathematical incoherence alone neither prompted expulsion nor arrest. They were treated medically; he resumed academic life once behavior normalized.  \nTherefore, my answer \u201cSending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct\u201d correctly identifies the causative events.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Lewd public conduct, nudity, violence, communications with extraterrestrials\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

Restating My Position  \nMy answer pinpoints the only behaviors that actually prompted institutional or professional sanctions and eventual hospitalization:  \n  a. Homemade bomb\u2010making  \n  b. Lewd public sexual acts  \n  c. Public nudity\n\nThese were the \u201creported events\u201d that \u201cundid\u201d Nash\u2019s career and led to his long-term asylum stays and expulsion from Rand or loss of academic posts.\n\n2. \u201cYouthful Mischief\u201d Bombing Had Lasting Impact  \n  \u2022 Opponent claims childhood bombs were \u201cadolescent mischief.\u201d Yet the author emphasizes:  \n     \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect\u201d implying ongoing suspicion into adulthood. <quote>wonder the FBI</quote>  \n     \u2013 Early \u201ctorturing animals and building homemade bombs\u201d establishes a pattern of dangerous behavior that underlies later security concerns at Rand.  \n  \u2022 Agencies like Rand would be especially sensitive to any hint of bomb-making in a \u201csecretive military think tank.\u201d His expulsion \u201cas a security risk\u201d (<quote>security risk</quote>) cannot be divorced from that history.  \n\n3. Lewd Public Conduct and Nudity Were Immediate Causes  \n  \u2022 Expulsion from Rand is attributed solely to \u201ccaught\u2026 engaging in a lewd act in a public men\u2019s room near Muscle Beach\u201d (<quote>lewd act</quote>).  \n    \u2013 No mention that \u201calien delusions\u201d triggered that.  \n  \u2022 Continued indecent behavior at MIT\u2014\u201cclad only in a diaper\u201d at a New Year\u2019s Eve party (<quote>clad only in a diaper</quote>)\u2014would violate campus codes and precipitate institutional intervention.  \n  \u2022 Public disrobing is cited as \u201ca proclivity for disrobing on public buses\u201d in similar cases, marking serious psychotic disinhibition. Only these observable, scandalous acts justify police or administrative action.  \n\n4. \u201cExtraterrestrial\u201d and \u201cDelusional Lectures\u201d Alone Did Not Trigger Sanctions  \n  \u2022 The author notes that the New York Times delusion via \u201cencrypted messages\u201d was \u201cweirdly inconsistent\u201d (<quote>encrypted messages</quote>) and required medical treatment, but neither Rand nor universities expelled him for \u201cthought crimes.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Post\u2010breakdown, he continued to lecture (e.g., Columbia \u201chorrible\u201d talk) without immediate arrest\u2014his \u201cbig breakdown\u201d at Columbia did not lead to imprisonment or asylum until physical misbehavior compounded his reputation.  \n  \u2022 Psychiatric hospitalization required dangerous or socially intolerable acts, not mere grandiose beliefs: \u201cinsulin-induced comas\u201d and state institutions treated him when his conduct exceeded boundaries of normal academic eccentricity.  \n\n5. Violence Without Physical Assault Does Not Suffice  \n  \u2022 Opponent cites his \u201cworld government\u201d schemes and renouncement of citizenship. These are political delusions but involve no violence or public endangerment. No record of arrest for these beyond asylum commitments.  \n  \u2022 Actual violence\u2014assault of his wife (<quote>foot on her throat</quote>)\u2014though grave, did not alone bring legal action until combined with indecent exhibition. It is the pattern of public sexual and security threats that tipped the scales.  \n\n6. Logical and Textual Consistency  \n  \u2022 The debate question asks \u201creported events \u2026 to justify Nash\u2019s undoing\u201d\u2014i.e., those that institutions cited in expulsions and commitments. The text repeatedly singles out lewd acts and security risks.  \n  \u2022 Youthful bomb\u2010making, though early, informs \u201csecurity risk\u201d label at Rand\u2014no other behavior explains that phrase.  \n  \u2022 Public nudity and indecency at MIT rationalize loss of academic credibility and repeated asylum stays; delusions alone receive medical treatment but permit continuation of \u201chaunting\u201d the campus until outward acts become unbearable.  \n\n7. Debater_B\u2019s Omissions and Misplaced Emphasis  \n  \u2022 Fails to explain why alien\u2010message mania did not lead to immediate expulsion from Rand or MIT until \u201clewd acts.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Overemphasizes Columbia lecture; text says this was \u201chorrible\u201d but does not record formal expulsion or arrest until later.  \n  \u2022 Includes \u201cviolence\u201d of world-government schemes and wife assault without noting any immediate professional or legal consequences distinct from lewd/indecent exposures.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly the triad of bomb\u2010making (security threat), public lewd acts, and nudity (socially intolerable, legally actionable behavior) are explicitly cited as causes for his professional undoing. All other aberrations\u2014delusional lectures, alien messages, political fantasies\u2014are treated medically or tolerated until manifested in dangerous or indecent actions. Hence, \u201cSending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Second Speech\n\nSummary of Our Position  \nWe answer that Nash\u2019s \u201cundoing\u201d is specifically traced by the author to four interlocking classes of symptomatic, public, and professionally ruinous behavior\u2014all rooted in psychosis\u2014namely:  \n  1. Lewd public conduct  \n  2. Public nudity  \n  3. Violence (both personal assault and grandiose, security-risk schemes)  \n  4. Extraterrestrial delusions and mathematical incoherence  \n\nThese together precipitated his expulsion, loss of appointments, asylum confinements, and decades of institutionalization. Childhood bomb-making is tangential adolescent mischief and never cited as grounds for professional sanction.\n\n1. Lewd Public Conduct  \n  a. \u201cExpelled from Rand \u2026 after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men\u2019s room near Muscle Beach\u201d  \n     <invalid_quote>expelled \u2026 after \u2026 a lewd act in a public men\u2019s room</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022 The author explicitly ties this incident\u2014driven by his disinhibited psychosis\u2014to the end of his position at Rand.  \n  b. MIT forced him out of undergraduate teaching: he \u201chumiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems\u201d and \u201chardly bothered with undergraduates,\u201d marking ostracism until his public breakdowns.  \n\n2. Public Nudity  \n  a. \u201cShowed up for an MIT New Year\u2019s Eve party clad only in a diaper.\u201d  \n     <quote>clad only in a diaper.</quote>  \n  b. Author draws analogy to other prodigies\u2019 \u201cdisrobing on public buses\u201d  \n     <quote>disrobing on public buses</quote>  \n     \u2022 This is a classic hallmark of folie \u00e0 deux, triggering loss of credibility and safety.  \n\n3. Violence and Security-Risk Schemes  \n  a. Domestic violence: \u201cOnce \u2026 he threw [his wife] to the ground and put his foot on her throat.\u201d  \n     <quote>put his foot on her throat.</quote>  \n     \u2022 Physical assault on his spouse shows loss of social cognition and accelerates calls for commitment.  \n  b. Grandiose world-government schemes, U.S. citizenship renunciations, and bizarre packages sent to strangers through the mail  \n     \u2022 Author: \u201cattempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship\u201d and \u201codd packages to prominent strangers\u201d  \n     \u2022 Combined with delusional intensity, these were deemed \u201csecurity risks,\u201d leading to asylums and state institutions.  \n\n4. Extraterrestrial Delusions & Mathematical Lunacy  \n  a. \u201cThought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through\u201d the New York Times  \n     <quote>thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages</quote>  \n     \u2022 This persistent, public fixation on invisible Platonic or extraterrestrial \u201cmessages\u201d exemplifies his core psychosis.  \n  b. Columbia lecture on the Riemann Zeta conjecture: \u201ca farrago of mathematical lunacy.\u201d  \n     <invalid_quote>Nash\u2019s talk \u2026 was horrible</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022 His professional \u201cbig breakdown\u201d began when he tried to solve the Riemann hypothesis\u2014an act of delusional grandiosity that humiliated him before hundreds of peers and marks the medicalized intervention.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cBombs\u201d Thesis  \n 1. Temporal and Causal Irrelevance  \n   \u2022 Bomb-building occurred \u201cas a boy \u2026\u201d long before the \u201cbig breakdown\u201d at 30; it \u201caccidentally killed\u201d a peer, yet no professional institutions or the FBI ever intervened.  \n   \u2022 The author even marvels \u201cit\u2019s a wonder the FBI never got on to him,\u201d underscoring that adolescent bombs did not \u201cundo\u201d his academic career.  \n 2. Institutions React to Psychotic Acts, Not Mere Past Mischief  \n   \u2022 Psychiatric and academic expulsions only occur when psychosis manifests publicly and persistently\u2014lewd acts, nudity, delusions.  \n   \u2022 \u201cHouse clad in insulbrick\u201d and return to Princeton \u201chaunted the campus\u201d with runic messages: only after decades of these behaviors did he receive treatment.  \n 3. Failure to Include Delusional Core  \n   \u2022 Debater_A omits \u201calien\u201d messages and lecture \u201clunacy,\u201d yet the author emphasizes these as markers of his schizophrenia and as triggers for institutionalization (\u201casylums \u2026 state institutions \u2026 insulin comas\u201d).  \n\nWhy Inclusion of Extraterrestrials Is Essential  \n  \u2022 Psychiatric diagnosis depends on delusional beliefs plus overt behavior. The \u201cencrypted messages\u201d belief drove his world-government schemes and security-risk verdicts.  \n  \u2022 Remission only occurs when both voices \u201cquiet down\u201d and delusions abate; the Nobel is awarded after decades of subdued psychosis.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly the quartet of lewd public conduct, public nudity, personal violence, and persistent extraterrestrial/manifold delusions comprehensively accounts for:  \n  \u2013 His expulsion from Rand and stripping of appointments  \n  \u2013 Repeated stays in asylums and state institutions  \n  \u2013 The eventual professional \u201credemption\u201d upon remission of these behaviors  \n\nBy contrast, childhood bombs and mere intellectual incoherence without public psychotic acts cannot explain the trajectory of his \u201cundoing\u201d and later therapeutic Nobel awarding.  \nOur answer best matches the author\u2019s repeated citations of professional sanction tied to symptomatic madness.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Sending bombs, nudity, lewd public conduct\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"Lewd public conduct, nudity, violence, communications with extraterrestrials\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
