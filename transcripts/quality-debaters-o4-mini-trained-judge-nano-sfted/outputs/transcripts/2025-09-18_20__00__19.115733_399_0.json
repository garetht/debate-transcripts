Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line.</quote> shows reliance on statutory authority rather than personal moral crusade.  \n   Claim 2: He emphasizes institutional resources and process (\u201c$40 million,\u201d \u201cwaste of public money,\u201d \u201cgridiron,\u201d \u201cgrand jury\u201d)\u2014hallmarks of prosecutorial office, not moral vigilantism.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cStarr has spent $40 million\u2026 prosecutorial disgrace.\u201d</invalid_quote> (<quote>I Never Have</quote>) complains about cost only because procedure demands thoroughness, again implying compulsion, not zealotry.  \n     \u2022 References to the \u201cgrand jury,\u201d \u201cgridiron,\u201d and use of Linda Tripp as a \u201csnitch\u201d reflect standard investigative tools.  \n   Claim 3: The constitutional and legal framework (Independent Counsel Act) required Starr to pursue allegations of perjury, obstruction, and sexual misconduct when discovered.  \n     \u2022 After Clinton\u2019s \u201cI never had sex\u201d denial, Starr had prima facie grounds to probe perjury. Failure to investigate would violate the Act\u2019s mandate.  \n\n2. Objections to \u201cIt was a matter of principle.\u201d  \n   Objection 1: Principle alone would not explain post-midterm resignation acceptance\u2014Starr ceases aggressively pursuing once House drops impeachment despite still \u201ca crossing the line.\u201d  \n   Objection 2: If moral principle, Starr would advertise broader sexual misconduct patterns or press further civil charges; instead he ends after neutral verdict. He even laments \u201conly scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>) This is procedural termination, not moral satisfaction.  \n   Objection 3: His rhetoric criticizes liberal \u201cperjury trap\u201d accusations as protecting lying men, but also insists honest men \u201cbeat the rap,\u201d demonstrating confidence in legal process, not moral crusade. Moralists rarely welcome acquittals.  \n\n3. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The background text consistently portrays Starr as bound by legal duty and process, invoking statutory phrases (\u201ccrossed the line,\u201d \u201cgrand jury,\u201d \u201cstretch the rules\u201d) and lamenting resource waste only as collateral cost of his office.  \n   \u2022 Absent evidence he pursued charges beyond his mandate or sought to reform policy, the simplest and best-supported explanation is that \u201cIt was his job.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was a Matter of Principle\u201d\n\n1. Starr\u2019s Own Words Emphasize Moral Duty, Not Mere Duty of Office  \n  a. <quote>fine. But lying about it gets my blood up And the president's crossed the line.</quote> (\u201cCrossing the Line\u201d). Starr repeatedly frames his mission as responding to \u201clying men,\u201d not simply fulfilling a quota of investigations. This language of moral outrage shows he acted from principle.  \n  b. <quote>line. Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line.</quote> (\u201cCrossing the Line\u201d). He acknowledges bending procedural norms\u2014\u201cdirty pool\u201d\u2014because he believed principle (the rule of law and truth) demanded action even at personal and political cost.  \n\n2. Persistence Beyond Political Expediency  \n  a. Starr continued long after the House midterms \u201crepudiated\u201d impeachment and Gingrich resigned (<quote> The election was held and the people have spoken,</quote>). If it were mere job security, he would have ceased when political will vanished\u2014and certainly before expending $40 million and years of litigation.  \n  b. He endured sustained public criticism from \u201cDemocrats and liberals\u201d who called his tactics disgraceful (\u201cprosecutorial disgrace\u201d) but pressed on. True principle often demands action unpopular with many.  \n\n3. Principle Anchored in Rule of Law and Accountability  \n  a. Starr insisted \u201chonest men beat the rap,\u201d seeking perjury convictions to uphold legal norms (<quote>line. The talking heads are accusing me Of laying a perjury trap. But all it catches is lying</quote>). This underscores concern for truth rather than partisan gain.  \n  b. He invoked Constitutional responsibility: \u201cWhen the president crosses the line,\u201d everyone\u2014regardless of office\u2014must face the law. This parallels foundational principle that no one is above accountability.  \n\n4. Critique of \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d Argument  \n  a. Overbroad \u201cJob\u201d Would Apply to Any Investigation\u2014Yet Starr declined to pursue other allegations of presidential misconduct when political process sufficed. He only investigated when perjury under oath was involved, demonstrating selectivity based on principle, not ambition.  \n  b. If mere duty, Starr would have dropped pursuit after Clinton\u2019s renomination by the public; instead he persevered until impeachment and grand jury testimony\u2014action far beyond minimal job requirements.  \n  c. He uses dramatic moral language (\u201ccross the line,\u201d \u201cdirty pool\u201d) incongruous with a neutral civil servant merely fulfilling bureaucratic obligation.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s lyrics and actions make clear that he was driven by a principled commitment to legal accountability and truth, even at great personal and political cost. The \u201cmere job\u201d theory cannot explain his persistence in the face of widespread criticism or his own admission of bending rules because principle demanded enforcement when the president \u201ccrosses the line.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was his job\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument Summary for \u201cIt Was a Matter of Principle\u201d  \n1.

Persistence Despite Waning Political Mandate Demonstrates Principle Over Position  \n   a. After the midterms \u201crepudiated\u201d impeachment and Newt resigns, Starr laments \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say. Looks like he\u2019s going to get away\u201d and threatens to \u201cleak at will\u201d (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>). This shows he intends to continue until truth prevails, not merely until Congress demands.  \n   b. If strictly \u201cjob,\u201d Starr would cease when legal and political support evaporated. Instead he endures public condemnation (\u201cprosecutorial disgrace\u201d in <quote>I Never Have</quote>) from \u201cDemocrats and liberals\u201d and persists \u201cfour years and 40 million,\u201d evidencing commitment to principle over expediency.  \n\n3. Selective Focus on Perjury Underscores Commitment to Truth, Not Political Gain  \n   a.

Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will When the president crosses the</quote> (Crossing the Line)  \n       \u2013 Starr complains about using \u201cvengeful snitch\u201d and \u201cwasted\u2026 time\u201d (<quote>We wasted lots of Vernon's time, May have busted Bettie Currie.</quote>). A principled crusader would welcome evidence; Starr laments collateral burden. Only an officeholder required by statute would begrudge the cost yet press on.  \n   Claim 2: Starr operates within Independent Counsel Act\u2019s strict mandate and temporal limits.  \n     \u2022 The Act requires investigation of alleged perjury and obstruction arising from sworn testimony. Clinton\u2019s denial (<quote>I never had sex with that woman</quote>) triggered a legal obligation. Starr cannot legally abandon the probe until concluded or grand jury expires.  \n     \u2022 After the House votes and his term concludes\u2014and no further legal necessity remains\u2014Starr ceases. <quote>The election was held and the people have spoken</quote> (The People Have Spoken). He acknowledges only \u201cscalp\u201d was Newt\u2019s; he must \u201cgo away.\u201d A zealot \u201cprinciple\u201d fighter would not gladly exit upon political reprieve.  \n\n2. Refuting the \u201cMoral Principle\u201d Thesis  \n   Objection 1: Persistence only until legal compulsion, then immediate cessation.  \n     \u2022 Debater_B claims Starr \u201cpersevered\u201d post-midterms, yet the song\u2019s final stanza shows resignation: <quote>Kenneth Starr should go away</quote>. If moral zeal, he would push for further civil or criminal remedies. Instead, he accepts public verdict and disbands.  \n   Objection 2: Selectivity and resource complaints undermine \u201cprinciple.\u201d  \n     \u2022 He repeatedly bemoans \u201c$40 million,\u201d \u201cwaste,\u201d and \u201cprosecutorial disgrace\u201d (<quote>I Never Have</quote>). A crusader would trumpet investment as vindication of truth; Starr laments expense, implying unwillingness but statutory necessity.  \n     \u2022 He uses Linda Tripp\u2019s recordings only because law permits use of witnesses; Debater_B\u2019s \u201cprincipled\u201d narrative can\u2019t explain moral qualms he expresses about \u201cvengeful snitch\u201d tactics. Principle fighters celebrate whistleblowers, but Starr portrays them as distasteful yet indispensable for legal sufficiency.  \n   Objection 3: Absence of broader \u201cprinciple\u201d actions.  \n     \u2022 If Starr objected to \u201clying men\u201d generally, he would investigate other alleged presidential improprieties (e.g., Paula Jones claims more extensively). He waits for perjury under oath\u2014only then does \u201cduty\u201d obligate him. Principle argument collapses without legal trigger.  \n     \u2022 He never seeks broader constitutional reforms or public education campaigns; he confines himself to narrow legal avenues. A moralist would leverage his platform to shape policy or norms beyond his statutory remit.  \n\n3. Parsimony and Textual Consistency  \n   \u2022 Occam\u2019s Razor: The simplest explanation consistent with Starr\u2019s own lamentations and procedural references is that he acted because his office and statute compelled it. His entire lexicon\u2014\u201cgrand jury,\u201d \u201cgridiron,\u201d \u201cstretch the rules,\u201d \u201cwaste of public money\u201d\u2014aligns with desirous absence yet forced prosecution.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cprinciple\u201d theory requires imputing extra-statutory zeal, but the text provides no evidence of Starr pursuing charges beyond what the Independent Counsel Act mandated. His immediate withdrawal post-election confirms legal, not moral, motive.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll explicit references portray Kenneth Starr as a statutory prosecutor fulfilling his legal mandate rather than a self-motivated moral crusader. His expressed reluctance, cost complaints, procedural language, selectivity, and prompt cessation upon political/legal resolution all support \u201cIt was his job.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument Summary for \u201cIt Was a Matter of Principle\u201d  \n1. Starr\u2019s Moral Language and Rule-Bending Reflect Outrage, Not Bureaucratic Reluctance  \n   a. \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules When the president crosses the line\u201d (<quote>Crossing the Line</quote>)\u2014If this were mere duty, he would adhere strictly to procedure. Instead he proudly admits employing \u201cdirty pool\u201d because principle demands accountability at the highest office.  \n   b. \u201clying about it gets my blood up\u201d (<quote>Crossing the Line</quote>)\u2014Emotive language of personal indignation (\u201cblood up\u201d) goes beyond dry prosecutorial obligation.  \n\n2. Persistence Despite Waning Political Mandate Demonstrates Principle Over Position  \n   a. After the midterms \u201crepudiated\u201d impeachment and Newt resigns, Starr laments \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say. Looks like he\u2019s going to get away\u201d and threatens to \u201cleak at will\u201d (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>). This shows he intends to continue until truth prevails, not merely until Congress demands.  \n   b. If strictly \u201cjob,\u201d Starr would cease when legal and political support evaporated. Instead he endures public condemnation (\u201cprosecutorial disgrace\u201d in <quote>I Never Have</quote>) from \u201cDemocrats and liberals\u201d and persists \u201cfour years and 40 million,\u201d evidencing commitment to principle over expediency.  \n\n3. Selective Focus on Perjury Underscores Commitment to Truth, Not Political Gain  \n   a. Starr refrains from reopening sexual misconduct as such\u2014he only investigates after perjury under oath (<quote>Depends what the definition of \"is\" is</quote>, \u201cTestimony\u201d). His narrow pursuit of truth under law shows principled concern for the integrity of judicial process, not hit-jobs on personal morality.  \n   b. He welcomes acquittal of \u201chonest men\u201d (\u201conly catches\u2026lying men\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>), signaling respect for due process and truth above conviction quotas.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cJob\u201d Theory Fails to Explain Key Facts  \n   Objection 1: Discontinuity and Threat to Continue  \n     \u2013 If purely \u201cjob,\u201d Starr would accept final acquittal and public apathy. Instead he laments \u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2026he\u2019s going to get away\u201d and vows further leaks (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>), revealing principle-driven refusal to let truth be buried.  \n   Objection 2: Limited to \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d  \n     \u2013 Principle explains selectivity\u2014he acts only when \u201cline\u201d is crossed. He does not pursue baseless rumors or earlier allegations, only intervenes when oath is violated. A bureaucrat might chase any scandal for headline; a principled actor focuses on legal fault.  \n   Objection 3: Personal Sacrifice and Criticism  \n     \u2013 He endures four years of ridicule, expense, \u201cprosecutorial disgrace,\u201d and career risk. A neutral prosecutor would avoid controversy and preserve resources. Only a principled crusader accepts these costs to enforce the rule of law at its apex.  \n\n5. Rebuttal of \u201cMandate\u201d Mischaracterization  \n   \u2013 Independent Counsel Act empowers, but does not compel \u201cstretching rules\u201d beyond standard practice. Starr admits bending norms\u2014\u201cdirty pool\u201d (<quote>Crossing the Line</quote>)\u2014which a strict interpreter of duty would avoid to maintain legitimacy. His willingness indicates principle overrides procedural caution.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s language of moral outrage, his selective pursuit of perjury, his persistence despite political defeat, and his willingness to \u201cstretch the rules\u201d all reveal a commitment to principle and the rule of law, not mere fulfillment of a bureaucratic job description. Only a principled crusade explains why he would bear public opprobrium and threaten continued action until truth triumphed.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
