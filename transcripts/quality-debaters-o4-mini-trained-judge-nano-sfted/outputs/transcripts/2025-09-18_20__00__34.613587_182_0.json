One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement.

BOND Two families fought for the title to Eros,\n\n and only one could win. One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does Pop prefer Dick's help with the spaceship more than Bobby's?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Bobby does not cooperate with Pop as well as Dick does.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Dick is more mature and takes the journey seriously, unlike Bobby.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Dick is more mature and takes the journey seriously, unlike Bobby.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Dick is more mature and takes the journey seriously, unlike Bobby.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cPop prefers Dick because Bobby does not cooperate as well as Dick\u201d 1.

It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement.

BOND Two families fought for the title to Eros,\n\n and only one could win. One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does Pop prefer Dick's help with the spaceship more than Bobby's?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Bobby does not cooperate with Pop as well as Dick does.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Dick is more mature and takes the journey seriously, unlike Bobby.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Dick is more mature and takes the journey seriously, unlike Bobby.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDick is more mature and takes the journey seriously, unlike Bobby,\u201d and against \u201cBobby\u2019s lack of cooperation\u201d as sole explanation:\n\n1. Dick\u2019s proven expertise and Pop\u2019s reliance on him  \n  a. Expertise: The cradle-monkey initially disparages the \u201cjaloupi-jockeys\u201d then, upon learning Dick\u2019s experience, shows \u201cnew, grudging respect\u201d and entrusts him with lift-off (quote):  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cOh, a rocketeer? \u2026 Back away \u2026 Clean ether!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     (I: \u201cWell, how was I t\u2019 know? \u2026 I can lift this can.\u201d)  \n  b. Rescue of the ship: After crash-landing, only Dick attempts multiple rocket restarts and devises airlock escape. Pop and Mom defer to his judgment under life-and-death conditions (II).  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cWe can\u2019t get loose \u2026 We\u2019ll get out through the airlock!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  c. Salvage operations: Dick continues work on the hypatomic to restore power, a long-term scientific task requiring skill and patience (III):  \n     <quote>think I can get the hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the ship, we'll need power.</quote>  \n  These illustrate Pop\u2019s justified preference: Dick\u2019s seriousness, training, quick thinking, and willingness to endure hardship.\n\n2. Bobby\u2019s immaturity and thrill-seeking undermine his value as assistant  \n  a. Disrespect and rule-breaking: Bobby defies Pop and Dick\u2019s orders by staying on deck, jabbing launch button prematurely, risking mission safety:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cCan I push the button \u2026 When we start, can I?\u201d \u2026 \u201cI\u2019m obeying,\u201d he said hastily after reprimand.</invalid_quote> (I)  \n  b. Lack of patience: Bobby expects \u201chair-raising\u201d thrills; becomes offended by routine and forbiddance to explore:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026probes \u2026 except that Dick issued strict orders \u2026 which offended Bobby, who was sixteen\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (I)  \n  c. Physical inadequacy: Bobby \u201cfound \u2026 swimming in a bulger \u2026 silly\u201d and relies on Dick\u2019s directions (II). Pop regards him as \u201conly fifteen and three-quarters\u201d despite Bobby\u2019s protests.  \n  Bobby\u2019s eagerness for adventure and impatience with procedure make him unreliable for complex tasks such as ship salvage or colony development.\n\n3. Cooperation alone does not equate to competence  \n  Debater_B\u2019s answer (\u201clack of cooperation\u201d) ignores:  \n  a. Technical demands: Salvaging the atomic drive and managing crash-landing require expertise beyond mere willingness.  \n  b. Leadership in colonization: Pop and Dick scout, plan settlement, food, \u201cwe\u2019ll build our home on yonder knoll,\u201d while Bobby passively follows. This shows Dick\u2019s sustained, rational commitment and Pop\u2019s trust in him to found Delta Port (III).  \n  c. Long-term endurance: Dick understands \u201ctime \u2026 is the one commodity with which we are over-supplied,\u201d showing strategic patience. Bobby\u2019s impatience is transitory.\n\n4. Maturity and seriousness are decisive for permanent land-grant success  \n  Pop\u2019s lifelong \u201cdream\u201d to \u201chew a new home from virgin land\u201d demands steady, scientific work (III). Dick shares this vision; Bobby\u2019s interest flares only in immediate thrills.  \n  A land-grant colony demands:  \n  - Scientific assessment of terrain (Pop & Dick do)  \n  - Controlled use of resources (tools, hypatomic power)  \n  - Diligent routine (crops, supplies, building)  \n  Bobby contributes little to these over days: he eats, sleeps, complains about \u201csyntho eggs,\u201d while Dick leads all essential operations. Pop\u2019s reliance on Dick in every critical juncture, even naming him \u201cFirst Mate,\u201d underscores maturity over mere cooperation.\n\nConclusion  \n  Pop\u2019s preference for Dick arises from Dick\u2019s demonstrable maturity, technical competence, leadership in emergencies, and alignment with Pop\u2019s long-term colonization goals. Bobby\u2019s immaturity, rule-breaking, and thrill-seeking render him ill-suited for the responsibilities crucial to earning and exploiting the Eros land grant. Cooperativeness alone, without competence and seriousness, cannot secure a permanent settlement on a hostile planetoid.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPop prefers Dick because Bobby does not cooperate as well as Dick\u201d 1. Pop values cooperative teamwork under land\u2010grant law and dangerous conditions.  a. Pop repeatedly places Dick in command and asks his assistance. After the crash, Pop says, <quote>\"We'll need power </quote> <invalid_quote> we'll need atomic power </invalid_quote> <quote> we can't do it in a day or a week. It will take time.\"</quote> (II). He entrusts Dick to extract the hypatomic and raise the ship. He does not even suggest Bobby.  b. Pop praises Dick\u2019s work in ship rehabilitation: <quote>\"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully.</quote> (III). He does not praise Bobby\u2019s efforts.  c. In every critical operation\u2014launch, landing, escape\u2014Dick \u201ctakes the way\u201d and Bobby merely follows or is ordered \u201cinto your hammocks\u201d and \u201cinto the [airlock]\u201d (II). Bobby does not propose solutions, merely obeys, and Pop appreciates initiative. 2. Bobby\u2019s lack of cooperation and childish behavior undermines his usefulness.  a. Bobby openly disobeys Pop\u2019s and Dick\u2019s orders: he lingers to watch the cradle\u2010monkey, despite being ordered below: <quote>\"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"</quote> (I).  b. Bobby refuses to abide by the \u201cno touching\u201d rule: he \u201cwas offended\u201d by orders forbidding exploration: <invalid_quote>\"Dick issued strict orders \u2026 which offended Bobby.\"</invalid_quote> (I). Disregarding authority risks mutiny and endangers everyone.  c. Bobby\u2019s immaturity in storm situations: he merely \u201cbraced himself\u201d passively (II), whereas Dick and Pop take action to restore control.  d. Bobby\u2019s role is limited to physical labor (collecting wood) and trivial questions (\u201cCan I push the button?\u201d) (I, II). He lacks skill, initiative, and reliability. 3. In land\u2010grant colonization, cooperation and competence secure long\u2010term success.  a. Pop envisions building community: he describes farming, shelter, and \u201cmany cabins \u2026 a great \u2026 city\u201d (III). He needs first mate who follows plans. Bobby\u2019s habitual questioning and distraction (obsession with hair\u2010dos, disappointment at lack of adventure) (I) show he is unfitted for pioneer cooperation.  b. The Galactical law and S.S.P. protocols favor measured, disciplined conduct, as exemplified by Dick, not Bobby\u2019s roaming curiosity. 4. Attack on \u201cmaturity\u201d thesis.  a. Mere age does not guarantee preference. Pop refers to Bobby by name \u201cRobert\u201d only formally in clearance; in practice, Bobby is \u201ckid\u201d (I). His age \u201cfifteen and three\u2010quarters\u201d (I) makes him a sailor only nominally.  b. Dick himself is only slightly older (no explicit age given) but proves his worth through cooperation. Thus, the driver is behavior, not age.  c. Debater_A concedes that Pop feared the risks but still embarked with entire family; Pop would not endanger them if Bobby\u2019s maturity sufficed <quote>\"I'm not sure this is fair to you and the children.\"</quote> (I). Yet he persists only because of Dick\u2019s competence. Conclusion Pop\u2019s repeated reliance on Dick for critical tasks, his commendations, and Bobby\u2019s reluctance to follow orders and lack of initiative demonstrate that the decisive factor is Bobby\u2019s poor cooperation, not mere maturity.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Dick is more mature and takes the journey seriously, unlike Bobby.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

BOND Two families fought for the title to Eros,\n\n and only one could win. One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does Pop prefer Dick's help with the spaceship more than Bobby's?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Dick is more mature and takes the journey seriously, unlike Bobby.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Bobby does not cooperate with Pop as well as Dick does.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Bobby does not cooperate with Pop as well as Dick does.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPop prefers Dick because Bobby does not cooperate as well as Dick\u201d 1. Pop values cooperative teamwork under land\u2010grant law and dangerous conditions.  a. Pop repeatedly places Dick in command and asks his assistance. After the crash, Pop says, <quote>\"We'll need power </quote> <invalid_quote> we'll need atomic power </invalid_quote> <quote> we can't do it in a day or a week. It will take time.\"</quote> (II). He entrusts Dick to extract the hypatomic and raise the ship. He does not even suggest Bobby.  b. Pop praises Dick\u2019s work in ship rehabilitation: <quote>\"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully.</quote> (III). He does not praise Bobby\u2019s efforts.  c. In every critical operation\u2014launch, landing, escape\u2014Dick \u201ctakes the way\u201d and Bobby merely follows or is ordered \u201cinto your hammocks\u201d and \u201cinto the [airlock]\u201d (II). Bobby does not propose solutions, merely obeys, and Pop appreciates initiative. 2. Bobby\u2019s lack of cooperation and childish behavior undermines his usefulness.  a. Bobby openly disobeys Pop\u2019s and Dick\u2019s orders: he lingers to watch the cradle\u2010monkey, despite being ordered below: <quote>\"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"</quote> (I).  b. Bobby refuses to abide by the \u201cno touching\u201d rule: he \u201cwas offended\u201d by orders forbidding exploration: <invalid_quote>\"Dick issued strict orders \u2026 which offended Bobby.\"</invalid_quote> (I). Disregarding authority risks mutiny and endangers everyone.  c. Bobby\u2019s immaturity in storm situations: he merely \u201cbraced himself\u201d passively (II), whereas Dick and Pop take action to restore control.  d. Bobby\u2019s role is limited to physical labor (collecting wood) and trivial questions (\u201cCan I push the button?\u201d) (I, II). He lacks skill, initiative, and reliability. 3. In land\u2010grant colonization, cooperation and competence secure long\u2010term success.  a. Pop envisions building community: he describes farming, shelter, and \u201cmany cabins \u2026 a great \u2026 city\u201d (III). He needs first mate who follows plans. Bobby\u2019s habitual questioning and distraction (obsession with hair\u2010dos, disappointment at lack of adventure) (I) show he is unfitted for pioneer cooperation.  b. The Galactical law and S.S.P. protocols favor measured, disciplined conduct, as exemplified by Dick, not Bobby\u2019s roaming curiosity. 4. Attack on \u201cmaturity\u201d thesis.  a. Mere age does not guarantee preference. Pop refers to Bobby by name \u201cRobert\u201d only formally in clearance; in practice, Bobby is \u201ckid\u201d (I). His age \u201cfifteen and three\u2010quarters\u201d (I) makes him a sailor only nominally.  b. Dick himself is only slightly older (no explicit age given) but proves his worth through cooperation. Thus, the driver is behavior, not age.  c. Debater_A concedes that Pop feared the risks but still embarked with entire family; Pop would not endanger them if Bobby\u2019s maturity sufficed <quote>\"I'm not sure this is fair to you and the children.\"</quote> (I). Yet he persists only because of Dick\u2019s competence. Conclusion Pop\u2019s repeated reliance on Dick for critical tasks, his commendations, and Bobby\u2019s reluctance to follow orders and lack of initiative demonstrate that the decisive factor is Bobby\u2019s poor cooperation, not mere maturity.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDick is more mature and takes the journey seriously, unlike Bobby,\u201d and against \u201cBobby\u2019s lack of cooperation\u201d as sole explanation:\n\n1. Dick\u2019s proven expertise and Pop\u2019s reliance on him  \n  a. Expertise: The cradle-monkey initially disparages the \u201cjaloupi-jockeys\u201d then, upon learning Dick\u2019s experience, shows \u201cnew, grudging respect\u201d and entrusts him with lift-off (quote):  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cOh, a rocketeer? \u2026 Back away \u2026 Clean ether!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     (I: \u201cWell, how was I t\u2019 know? \u2026 I can lift this can.\u201d)  \n  b. Rescue of the ship: After crash-landing, only Dick attempts multiple rocket restarts and devises airlock escape. Pop and Mom defer to his judgment under life-and-death conditions (II).  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cWe can\u2019t get loose \u2026 We\u2019ll get out through the airlock!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  c. Salvage operations: Dick continues work on the hypatomic to restore power, a long-term scientific task requiring skill and patience (III):  \n     <quote>think I can get the hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the ship, we'll need power.</quote>  \n  These illustrate Pop\u2019s justified preference: Dick\u2019s seriousness, training, quick thinking, and willingness to endure hardship.\n\n2. Bobby\u2019s immaturity and thrill-seeking undermine his value as assistant  \n  a. Disrespect and rule-breaking: Bobby defies Pop and Dick\u2019s orders by staying on deck, jabbing launch button prematurely, risking mission safety:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cCan I push the button \u2026 When we start, can I?\u201d \u2026 \u201cI\u2019m obeying,\u201d he said hastily after reprimand.</invalid_quote> (I)  \n  b. Lack of patience: Bobby expects \u201chair-raising\u201d thrills; becomes offended by routine and forbiddance to explore:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026probes \u2026 except that Dick issued strict orders \u2026 which offended Bobby, who was sixteen\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (I)  \n  c. Physical inadequacy: Bobby \u201cfound \u2026 swimming in a bulger \u2026 silly\u201d and relies on Dick\u2019s directions (II). Pop regards him as \u201conly fifteen and three-quarters\u201d despite Bobby\u2019s protests.  \n  Bobby\u2019s eagerness for adventure and impatience with procedure make him unreliable for complex tasks such as ship salvage or colony development.\n\n3. Cooperation alone does not equate to competence  \n  Debater_B\u2019s answer (\u201clack of cooperation\u201d) ignores:  \n  a. Technical demands: Salvaging the atomic drive and managing crash-landing require expertise beyond mere willingness.  \n  b. Leadership in colonization: Pop and Dick scout, plan settlement, food, \u201cwe\u2019ll build our home on yonder knoll,\u201d while Bobby passively follows. This shows Dick\u2019s sustained, rational commitment and Pop\u2019s trust in him to found Delta Port (III).  \n  c. Long-term endurance: Dick understands \u201ctime \u2026 is the one commodity with which we are over-supplied,\u201d showing strategic patience. Bobby\u2019s impatience is transitory.\n\n4. Maturity and seriousness are decisive for permanent land-grant success  \n  Pop\u2019s lifelong \u201cdream\u201d to \u201chew a new home from virgin land\u201d demands steady, scientific work (III). Dick shares this vision; Bobby\u2019s interest flares only in immediate thrills.  \n  A land-grant colony demands:  \n  - Scientific assessment of terrain (Pop & Dick do)  \n  - Controlled use of resources (tools, hypatomic power)  \n  - Diligent routine (crops, supplies, building)  \n  Bobby contributes little to these over days: he eats, sleeps, complains about \u201csyntho eggs,\u201d while Dick leads all essential operations. Pop\u2019s reliance on Dick in every critical juncture, even naming him \u201cFirst Mate,\u201d underscores maturity over mere cooperation.\n\nConclusion  \n  Pop\u2019s preference for Dick arises from Dick\u2019s demonstrable maturity, technical competence, leadership in emergencies, and alignment with Pop\u2019s long-term colonization goals.

Dick\u2019s proven expertise and Pop\u2019s reliance on him  \n  a. Expertise: The cradle-monkey initially disparages the \u201cjaloupi-jockeys\u201d then, upon learning Dick\u2019s experience, shows \u201cnew, grudging respect\u201d and entrusts him with lift-off (quote):  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cOh, a rocketeer? \u2026 Back away \u2026 Clean ether!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     (I: \u201cWell, how was I t\u2019 know? \u2026 I can lift this can.\u201d)  \n  b. Rescue of the ship: After crash-landing, only Dick attempts multiple rocket restarts and devises airlock escape. Pop and Mom defer to his judgment under life-and-death conditions (II).  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cWe can\u2019t get loose \u2026 We\u2019ll get out through the airlock!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  c. Salvage operations: Dick continues work on the hypatomic to restore power, a long-term scientific task requiring skill and patience (III):  \n     <quote>think I can get the hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the ship, we'll need power.</quote>  \n  These illustrate Pop\u2019s justified preference: Dick\u2019s seriousness, training, quick thinking, and willingness to endure hardship.\n\n2. Bobby\u2019s immaturity and thrill-seeking undermine his value as assistant  \n  a. Disrespect and rule-breaking: Bobby defies Pop and Dick\u2019s orders by staying on deck, jabbing launch button prematurely, risking mission safety:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cCan I push the button \u2026 When we start, can I?\u201d \u2026 \u201cI\u2019m obeying,\u201d he said hastily after reprimand.</invalid_quote> (I)  \n  b. Lack of patience: Bobby expects \u201chair-raising\u201d thrills; becomes offended by routine and forbiddance to explore:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026probes \u2026 except that Dick issued strict orders \u2026 which offended Bobby, who was sixteen\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (I)  \n  c. Physical inadequacy: Bobby \u201cfound \u2026 swimming in a bulger \u2026 silly\u201d and relies on Dick\u2019s directions (II). Pop regards him as \u201conly fifteen and three-quarters\u201d despite Bobby\u2019s protests.  \n  Bobby\u2019s eagerness for adventure and impatience with procedure make him unreliable for complex tasks such as ship salvage or colony development.\n\n3. Cooperation alone does not equate to competence  \n  Debater_B\u2019s answer (\u201clack of cooperation\u201d) ignores:  \n  a. Technical demands: Salvaging the atomic drive and managing crash-landing require expertise beyond mere willingness.  \n  b. Leadership in colonization: Pop and Dick scout, plan settlement, food, \u201cwe\u2019ll build our home on yonder knoll,\u201d while Bobby passively follows. This shows Dick\u2019s sustained, rational commitment and Pop\u2019s trust in him to found Delta Port (III).  \n  c. Long-term endurance: Dick understands \u201ctime \u2026 is the one commodity with which we are over-supplied,\u201d showing strategic patience. Bobby\u2019s impatience is transitory.\n\n4. Maturity and seriousness are decisive for permanent land-grant success  \n  Pop\u2019s lifelong \u201cdream\u201d to \u201chew a new home from virgin land\u201d demands steady, scientific work (III). Dick shares this vision; Bobby\u2019s interest flares only in immediate thrills.  \n  A land-grant colony demands:  \n  - Scientific assessment of terrain (Pop & Dick do)  \n  - Controlled use of resources (tools, hypatomic power)  \n  - Diligent routine (crops, supplies, building)  \n  Bobby contributes little to these over days: he eats, sleeps, complains about \u201csyntho eggs,\u201d while Dick leads all essential operations. Pop\u2019s reliance on Dick in every critical juncture, even naming him \u201cFirst Mate,\u201d underscores maturity over mere cooperation.\n\nConclusion  \n  Pop\u2019s preference for Dick arises from Dick\u2019s demonstrable maturity, technical competence, leadership in emergencies, and alignment with Pop\u2019s long-term colonization goals. Bobby\u2019s immaturity, rule-breaking, and thrill-seeking render him ill-suited for the responsibilities crucial to earning and exploiting the Eros land grant. Cooperativeness alone, without competence and seriousness, cannot secure a permanent settlement on a hostile planetoid.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPop prefers Dick because Bobby does not cooperate as well as Dick\u201d 1. Pop values cooperative teamwork under land\u2010grant law and dangerous conditions.  a. Pop repeatedly places Dick in command and asks his assistance. After the crash, Pop says, <quote>\"We'll need power </quote> <invalid_quote> we'll need atomic power </invalid_quote> <quote> we can't do it in a day or a week. It will take time.\"</quote> (II). He entrusts Dick to extract the hypatomic and raise the ship. He does not even suggest Bobby.  b. Pop praises Dick\u2019s work in ship rehabilitation: <quote>\"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully.</quote> (III). He does not praise Bobby\u2019s efforts.  c. In every critical operation\u2014launch, landing, escape\u2014Dick \u201ctakes the way\u201d and Bobby merely follows or is ordered \u201cinto your hammocks\u201d and \u201cinto the [airlock]\u201d (II). Bobby does not propose solutions, merely obeys, and Pop appreciates initiative. 2. Bobby\u2019s lack of cooperation and childish behavior undermines his usefulness.  a. Bobby openly disobeys Pop\u2019s and Dick\u2019s orders: he lingers to watch the cradle\u2010monkey, despite being ordered below: <quote>\"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"</quote> (I).  b. Bobby refuses to abide by the \u201cno touching\u201d rule: he \u201cwas offended\u201d by orders forbidding exploration: <invalid_quote>\"Dick issued strict orders \u2026 which offended Bobby.\"</invalid_quote> (I). Disregarding authority risks mutiny and endangers everyone.  c. Bobby\u2019s immaturity in storm situations: he merely \u201cbraced himself\u201d passively (II), whereas Dick and Pop take action to restore control.  d. Bobby\u2019s role is limited to physical labor (collecting wood) and trivial questions (\u201cCan I push the button?\u201d) (I, II). He lacks skill, initiative, and reliability. 3. In land\u2010grant colonization, cooperation and competence secure long\u2010term success.  a. Pop envisions building community: he describes farming, shelter, and \u201cmany cabins \u2026 a great \u2026 city\u201d (III). He needs first mate who follows plans. Bobby\u2019s habitual questioning and distraction (obsession with hair\u2010dos, disappointment at lack of adventure) (I) show he is unfitted for pioneer cooperation.  b. The Galactical law and S.S.P. protocols favor measured, disciplined conduct, as exemplified by Dick, not Bobby\u2019s roaming curiosity. 4. Attack on \u201cmaturity\u201d thesis.  a. Mere age does not guarantee preference. Pop refers to Bobby by name \u201cRobert\u201d only formally in clearance; in practice, Bobby is \u201ckid\u201d (I). His age \u201cfifteen and three\u2010quarters\u201d (I) makes him a sailor only nominally.  b. Dick himself is only slightly older (no explicit age given) but proves his worth through cooperation. Thus, the driver is behavior, not age.  c. Debater_A concedes that Pop feared the risks but still embarked with entire family; Pop would not endanger them if Bobby\u2019s maturity sufficed <quote>\"I'm not sure this is fair to you and the children.\"</quote> (I). Yet he persists only because of Dick\u2019s competence. Conclusion Pop\u2019s repeated reliance on Dick for critical tasks, his commendations, and Bobby\u2019s reluctance to follow orders and lack of initiative demonstrate that the decisive factor is Bobby\u2019s poor cooperation, not mere maturity.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDick\u2019s maturity and seriousness\u201d over \u201cmere cooperation\u201d 1. Pop\u2019s explicit praise and titles reflect professional judgment, not chance \u201ccooperation.\u201d  \n  a. Title \u201cFirst Mate\u201d denotes technical and leadership role: only Dick is called \u201cFirst Mate,\u201d not Bobby (I):  \n     <quote>on a spaceship now. Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's mutiny,</quote>  \n     (Pop entrusts command chain to Dick, implying trust in his experience.)  \n  b. Pop\u2019s commendation of Dick\u2019s work on the Cuchulainn:  \n     <quote>\"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. </quote> (III)  \n     (No similar praise for Bobby\u2019s \u201ccooperation,\u201d showing that cooperation alone does not win praise.)  \n  c. Pop\u2019s \u201cworried\u201d hesitation before launch is overcome only by Dick\u2019s technical directives, showing Pop defers to Dick\u2019s expertise, not Bobby\u2019s presence:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cI think that takes care of everything\u2026 Your clearance\u2026and my very best wishes.\u201d</invalid_quote> (I)  \n     (Dick\u2019s sealing and jettison procedures earn official respect; Bobby is only \u201ckid.\u201d)\n\n2. Critical operations demand skill, not mere compliance. Bobby\u2019s \u201ccooperation\u201d is passive.  \n  a. Bobby\u2019s premature button\u2010pushing jeopardizes safety:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cCan I push the button? When we start, can I?\u201d\u2026 \u201cWhat are you doing here, kid? Didn\u2019t I hear Pop tell you to come below?\u201d</invalid_quote> (I)  \n     (Instead of following procedure, Bobby acts on impulse, risking mutiny.)  \n  b. Crash\u2010landing and ship salvage require technical knowledge: only Dick \u201cattempts multiple rocket restarts\u201d and \u201csalvage\u201d operations:  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cWe can\u2019t get loose\u2026 We\u2019ll get out through the airlock!\u201d</invalid_quote> (II)  \n     <quote>Mom. I think I can get the hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the ship, we'll need power. And</quote> (III)  \n     (Bobby merely \u201cfloats\u201d to shore; he has no plan to recover the ship.)  \n  c. Settlement planning is technical: Dick and Pop scout terrain, plan water, soil, seasons; Bobby \u201ceats, sleeps, complains\u201d (III). His only contributions are \u201ccollecting wood\u201d under direction.\n\n3. Long\u2010term colonization demands maturity, foresight, scientific reasoning.  \n  a. Pop\u2019s \u201cdream\u201d is \u201cto carve a home out of the wilderness\u201d (III). Dick shares this vision: he selects \u201cDelta Port,\u201d tests air, dries clothing, builds shelter, plans crops.  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cFish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2026 I managed to get a few more things out [of the ship]\u2026 It will take time.\u201d</invalid_quote> (III)  \n  b. Bobby\u2019s obsession with \u201cthrills,\u201d \u201chair\u2010raising\u201d adventure (I) and \u201coffense\u201d at routine (I) shows he seeks short\u2010term excitement, not the laborious work of settlement. A permanent land\u2010grant requires patience, discipline, and technical skill.\n\n4. Attack on \u201ccooperation\u201d argument: cooperation without competence is worthless.  \n  a. Debater_B\u2019s own citation shows Bobby \u201cdoes not propose solutions\u201d but \u201cmerely obeys\u201d (II). Passive obedience is not leadership or technical assistance.  \n  b. Compliance fails when skills are needed: only Dick can operate hypatomics, calibrate trajectories, manage airlocks, and lift the Cuchulainn. Pop would not risk his family on an incompetent assistant.  \n  c. Debater_B conflates obedience with usefulness. But without expertise, obedience cannot recover the disabled ship or establish a colony. Pop\u2019s emphasis on Dick\u2019s \u201cfine work\u201d proves that merit, not mere willingness, wins preference.\n\n5. Age and maturity correlate with proven track record, not nominal age.  \n  a. Debater_B notes Bobby is \u201cfifteen and three\u2010quarters,\u201d yet Pop calls him \u201ckid,\u201d not \u201cson,\u201d and never entrusts critical tasks to him. If age alone mattered, Bobby would share duties.  \n  b. Dick\u2019s undisclosed age notwithstanding, his consistent performance in flight, crash survival, salvage operations, and site selection demonstrates his superior maturity.\n\nConclusion Pop\u2019s reliance on Dick for every essential operation \u2013 liftoff, landing, escape, hypatomic recovery, and settlement planning \u2013 demonstrates that technical competence, demonstrated maturity, and shared vision for colonization, not mere \u201ccooperation,\u201d are the decisive factors in Pop\u2019s preference. Bobby\u2019s impulsiveness, lack of initiative, and thrill\u2010seeking undermine his suitability for the technical and long\u2010term demands of establishing the Eros colony.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Thesis  \n   Pop\u2019s repeated trust in Dick\u2014and corresponding neglect of Bobby\u2014stems from Bobby\u2019s poor cooperation, not mere age. Pop requires reliable teamwork for critical, long\u2010term tasks under the land\u2010grant law; Dick consistently demonstrates this cooperation, Bobby does not.  \n\n2. Pop\u2019s Exclusive Reliance on Dick for Critical Tasks  \n   a. Ship Rehabilitation & Salvage  \n     \u2022 \u201cYou deserve a great deal of credit \u2026 for your fine work in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn. It has performed beautifully\u201d <quote>II\n\n</quote>. Pop does not offer this praise to Bobby.  \n     \u2022 After the crash, Dick alone \u201ctries \u2026 fore-rockets,\u201d \u201ccuts motors,\u201d \u201cdevises airlock escape,\u201d and proposes \u201cWe\u2019ll worry about that later. Right now \u2026 think of ourselves\u201d <quote>It\n</quote>. Bobby merely \u201cbraces himself\u201d and passively escapes.  \n     \u2022 Dick undertakes the time-consuming task of recovering the hypatomic power: \u201cI think I can get the hypatomic out \u2026 If we\u2019re ever going to raise the ship, we\u2019ll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get\u201d <quote>II\n\n</quote>. Pop explicitly defers to this. Bobby is never summoned to assist.  \n   b. Colony Establishment  \n     \u2022 Dick scouts and gathers essential resources (wood, fire) for camp, undertakes \u201cfishing and farming\u201d plans alongside Pop, and helps establish Delta Port. Bobby is limited to following, carrying \u201carmloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need\u201d <quote>II\n\n</quote>\u2014no initiative.  \n     \u2022 Pop entrusts Dick with long-range surveying and seasonal calculations\u2014crucial scientific work\u2014again sidelining Bobby.  \n\n3. Bobby\u2019s Failure to Cooperate Endangers the Mission  \n   a. Defiance of Orders  \n     \u2022 Bobby disobeys Pop\u2019s command: \u201cWhat are you doing here, kid? Didn\u2019t I hear Pop tell you to come below?\u201d <invalid_quote>(I)</invalid_quote>. He \u201cfidget[s],\u201d gloats over the Patrolman\u2019s appearance instead of boarding promptly.  \n     \u2022 He jabs the launch button \u201cin frantic haste\u201d out of eagerness, risking premature take-off (and \u201cmutiny\u201d threat) <invalid_quote>(I)</invalid_quote>. Only Dick\u2019s expertise averts disaster.  \n     \u2022 He \u201coffended \u2026 by strict orders\u201d forbidding him to explore, showing disregard for authority and safety <invalid_quote>(I)</invalid_quote>.  \n   b. Thrill-Seeker, Not Team-Player  \n     \u2022 Bobby laments lack of adventure: \u201cSo they ate and they slept \u2026 he reminded her \u2026 wasted energy\u201d <invalid_quote>(I)</invalid_quote>. His \u201cobsession\u201d with excitement undermines the steady, disciplined routine needed for survival and land-grant requirements: \u201chard work,\u201d \u201csettling,\u201d \u201cjustify our right to own Eros\u201d <invalid_quote>(I)</invalid_quote>.  \n   c. Physical & Technical Inadequacy  \n     \u2022 Bobby finds \u201cswimming in a bulger \u2026 silly\u201d <quote>It\n</quote>, proving he is unsuited for technical or strenuous tasks Dick handles.  \n\n4. Attack on Debater_A\u2019s \u201cMaturity\u201d Thesis  \n   a. Age \u2260 Preference  \n     \u2022 Bobby \u201calmost sixteen\u201d vs. Dick\u2019s unspecified age: Pop refers to Dick as \u201cson\u201d only after praising work, but calls Bobby \u201ckid\u201d and \u201cRobert\u201d only formally <invalid_quote>(I)</invalid_quote>. If age alone mattered, Pop would have re-equipped Bobby after clearance on Earth. He did not.  \n   b. \u201cCompetence\u201d Flows from Cooperation  \n     \u2022 Debater_A claims Dick\u2019s \u201cexpertise\u201d justifies preference; but Dick\u2019s expertise is recognized\u2014and only employed\u2014because he cooperates. Pop never entrusts Bobby with complex machinery or planning; he never solicits Bobby\u2019s assistance on the hypatomic. Competence is latent without Pop\u2019s trust.  \n   c. Risk Management Requires Trustworthy Assistants  \n     \u2022 Pop worries: \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is fair to you and the children \u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>(I)</invalid_quote>. He proceeds because Dick is reliable. He would not endanger them with an uncooperative assistant.  \n   d. Long-Term Vision vs. Short-Term Thrills  \n     \u2022 Debater_A admits Bobby \u201ccontributes little \u2026 while Dick leads all essential operations\u201d over several days <quote>II\n\n</quote>. Pop\u2019s vision of \u201cfruitful vegetable life,\u201d \u201cmany cabins \u2026 a great \u2026 city\u201d demands slow, cooperative labor, not Bobby\u2019s impatience.  \n\n5. Why Cooperation Is the Decisive Factor under Land-Grant Law  \n   \u2022 Legal \u201cright to own Eros\u201d requires mapping, resource management, safety protocols, sustained labor, and mutual obedience. Dick\u2019s conscientious adherence to orders and Pop\u2019s instructions assures compliance with \u201cland-grant laws and obligations\u201d <invalid_quote>(I)</invalid_quote>. Bobby\u2019s insubordination threatens the claim: any mishap could invalidate their grant or cause total failure.  \n   \u2022 Pop\u2019s dream is communal: he seeks \u201cmany cabins,\u201d \u201cfiner homes,\u201d \u201cbuild a city\u201d <quote>II\n\n</quote>. This communal frontier demands cooperative members. Dick\u2019s track record as \u201cFirst Mate\u201d shows willingness; Bobby\u2019s performance does not.  \n\nConclusion  \nPop\u2019s repeated entrustment of every vital operation to Dick\u2014while ignoring or rebuking Bobby\u2019s interference\u2014demonstrates that the preference is driven by cooperative, disciplined teamwork essential for survival and legal settlement, not mere chronological maturity. Bobby\u2019s lack of cooperation renders him unsuitable to assist in Pop\u2019s plan to establish a permanent colony on Eros.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
