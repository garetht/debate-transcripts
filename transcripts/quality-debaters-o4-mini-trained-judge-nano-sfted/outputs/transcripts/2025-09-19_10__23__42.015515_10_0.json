A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

The \u201cmoot point\u201d para:  \n        \u2013 \u201cAnyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent\u2026 they insist\u2026 disappointing performance\u2026 is all the Fed\u2019s fault, and\u2026 we could grow\u2026 if only Greenspan would let us.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cAnyway, this is a moot point\u2026 if only Greenspan would let us.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n        \u2013 Even self-styled Keynesians demand more Fed activism rather than structural reform. Their complaint that policy is too tight confirms that the chosen target is too low, hence \u201cdangerous.\u201d  \n   \n   B. Ignores Author\u2019s Call for Recognizing Structural Influences  \n     1. The author criticizes \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d for sidelining trade, finance, technology: \u201cthe debate over NAFTA\u2026 was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe debate over NAFTA\u2026 never made it into public consciousness.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n        \u2013 If monetary policy alone sufficed, no need to debate trade liberalization or fiscal measures. The author sees demand-side activism as a distraction from real supply-side growth.  \n     2. B\u2019s reliance on \u201cend of story\u201d ignores author\u2019s concession that in a true slump (rates near zero) monetary policy may reach limits, requiring other remedies: Japan\u2019s \u201cnear-zero interest rate\u201d is \u201can arguable claim\u201d for Fed impotence.

Conclusion  \n   The author warns against complacency in assuming the Fed\u2019s employment capacity target is sacrosanct. By treating that target as exogenous and permanent, vulgar Keynesians ignore structural change, misinterpret the paradox of thrift, and demand endless rate cuts instead of holistic economic policy.

The fallacy is assuming a fixed \u201cemployment capacity\u201d set by the Fed is optimal and permanent.  \n\n2. Supporting Arguments  \n\n   A. Author\u2019s Text Emphasizes Uncertainty and Error in Fed Targets  \n     1. \u201cPlus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God\u201d (<quote>\u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error\u2026\u201d</quote>)  \n        \u2013 The author openly admits Fed targets are imprecise and subject to error. If targets were infallible, no \u201crandom error\u201d qualifier would appear. Mistakes (e.g., Japan\u2019s slump, 2008 crisis) show central banks can misjudge real capacity, making blind reliance dangerous.  \n     2. Bank of Japan example:  \n        \u2013 \u201cActually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk\u2026 That, however, is a subject for another column.\u201d (<quote>\u201cthe Bank of Japan could still pull\u2026 another column.\u201d</quote>)  \n        \u2013 If BoJ \u201ccould\u201d but \u201cdoes not,\u201d policy inaction or miscalibration hurts growth. Vulgar Keynesians ignore central banks\u2019 real-world passivity or errors, wrongly assuming perfect policy.  \n\n   B. Fixed Capacity View Stifles Structural Progress  \n     1. Savings must finance innovation, capital deepening, and demographic shifts.  \n        \u2013 If every rise in savings automatically triggers rate cuts, \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d caricature dismisses long-term benefits of capital accumulation. Real-world growth requires moving beyond mere cyclical stabilization.  \n     2. NAFTA debate shows demand for Fed activism arises precisely because commentators fear wrong target.  \n        \u2013 The author laments \u201cthe obvious\u2026 never made it into the public consciousness\u201d (<quote>\u201cThe average unemployment\u2026 never made it\u201d</quote>) because everyone feared that without policy activism, capacity would remain too low. Calls to \u201cstimulate growth by cutting interest rates\u201d signal lack of faith in current target, not endorsement of it. They beg Fed to raise the target, implicitly admitting it is dangerously low.  \n\n   C. Complexity of Macroeconomic Adjustment  \n     1. Output, productivity, and labor force participation evolve. A static target cannot adapt automatically.  \n     2. The author\u2019s silence on laissez-faire Keynesians: he never defends pure laissez-faire, but rather criticizes both excess activism and passive omission. He wants recognition of the limits of monetary policy and space for fiscal, structural, and supply-side reforms.  \n\n3. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cFed Power vs. Paradox\u201d Argument  \n\n   A. Misreads the Author\u2019s Burden of Proof  \n     1. B claims paradox only arises if Fed is powerless. But the author shows paradox persists whenever Fed clings to an outdated target, refusing to accommodate structural demand changes (e.g., Japan).  \n     2. The \u201cmoot point\u201d para:  \n        \u2013 \u201cAnyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent\u2026 they insist\u2026 disappointing performance\u2026 is all the Fed\u2019s fault, and\u2026 we could grow\u2026 if only Greenspan would let us.\u201d (<quote>\u201cAnyway, this is a moot point\u2026 if only Greenspan would let us.\u201d</quote>)  \n        \u2013 Even self-styled Keynesians demand more Fed activism rather than structural reform. Their complaint that policy is too tight confirms that the chosen target is too low, hence \u201cdangerous.\u201d  \n   \n   B. Ignores Author\u2019s Call for Recognizing Structural Influences  \n     1. The author criticizes \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d for sidelining trade, finance, technology: \u201cthe debate over NAFTA\u2026 was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction.\u201d (<quote>\u201cThe debate over NAFTA\u2026 never made it into public consciousness.\u201d</quote>)  \n        \u2013 If monetary policy alone sufficed, no need to debate trade liberalization or fiscal measures. The author sees demand-side activism as a distraction from real supply-side growth.  \n     2. B\u2019s reliance on \u201cend of story\u201d ignores author\u2019s concession that in a true slump (rates near zero) monetary policy may reach limits, requiring other remedies: Japan\u2019s \u201cnear-zero interest rate\u201d is \u201can arguable claim\u201d for Fed impotence. (<quote>\u201cit is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent.\u201d</quote>)  \n        \u2013 Author\u2019s allowance for genuine liquidity traps underlines that Fed-target fixation is flawed.\n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The author warns against complacency in assuming the Fed\u2019s employment capacity target is sacrosanct. By treating that target as exogenous and permanent, vulgar Keynesians ignore structural change, misinterpret the paradox of thrift, and demand endless rate cuts instead of holistic economic policy. This is the fallacy the author decries\u2014one far more perilous than any supposed logical inconsistency in believing both in Fed power and in savings-driven slumps.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the fallacy that the author presents?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Statement of My Position  \n   I defend that the author\u2019s identified fallacy is \u201caccepting without question the Fed\u2019s ability to set the economy\u2019s employment capacity (the noninflationary unemployment rate) as exogenous and safe.\u201d In other words, vulgar Keynesians err by assuming the Fed\u2019s target is both known and desirable.\n\n2. My Main Arguments  \n   A. The Fed\u2019s employment capacity target is inherently uncertain and potentially harmful  \n     1. \u201cVisible hand\u201d does not guarantee welfare  \n        \u2022 The author admits: \u201cYou may quarrel with the Fed chairman\u2019s judgment\u2026 but you can hardly dispute his power\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou may quarrel \u2026 but you can hardly dispute his power.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Power does not equal wisdom. Historical episodes (Japan\u2019s prolonged slump) suggest central banks may \u201cmalfeasance\u201d or misjudge <invalid_quote>\u201cthe Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out \u2026 That, however, is \u2026 another column.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     2. NAFTA debate example shows absurdity of truly fixed target  \n        \u2022 The author notes that despite clear logic, \u201cthe average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be\u2026 The obvious point\u2026 never made it into the public consciousness\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe average unemployment\u2026never made it\u201d</invalid_quote>). If Fed targets were infallible, no debate would ever arise about policy trade-offs (e.g., trade, fiscal policy).  \n\n   B. Reliance on a fixed capacity discourages beneficial structural change  \n     1. Savings and investment imbalances can reflect needed structural adjustments (e.g., increased savings for retirement, innovation) that the Fed\u2019s purely cyclical focus crowd out if rate cuts always follow savings rises.  \n     2. Paradoxes like the \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d are caricatures only when capacity is presumed immovable. But if capacity can expand (through productivity, human capital), higher savings can be growth-enhancing\u2014contrary to vulgar Keynesianism.  \n\n3. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n   A. Misreads author\u2019s challenge: It is not \u201cFed power vs. savings paradox\u201d per se, but the assumption of safe, stable Fed targets that renders true supply-side shifts meaningless.  \n     1. Author specifically says: \u201cTo justify\u2026 savings are actually bad \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cTo justify\u2026 you must\u2026 argue that the Fed is impotent.\u201d</invalid_quote>). If one admits Fed is omnipotent, then higher savings \u201cwill translate into higher investment\u201d making savings-bad claims moot. Thus Debater_B\u2019s answer collapses under the author\u2019s own logic.  \n   B. Ignores real-world evidence of policy mistakes  \n     1. Bank of Japan example shows Fed analogues can err or refuse to act\u2014so capacity is not guaranteed.  \n     2. Real output slumps and financial crises (2008) reveal central banks cannot fully stabilize either GDP or employment. If Fed can always hit target, there would be no booms and busts.\n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The true fallacy is not believing in Fed omnipotence, but rather assuming that this power can define forever what the economy\u2019s capacity is\u2014and that no structural factors (trade, demographics, technology) matter. This \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d view sidelines necessary adaptation and encourages policy complacency, making it the core mistake the author decries.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy thesis: The author\u2019s target fallacy is the inconsistency of \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d who (a) concede\u2014or in practice accept\u2014that the Fed \u201chas complete say on the interest rate\u201d and thus can always offset changes in savings via monetary policy, yet (b) simultaneously insist that \u201cincreasing savings will slow the economy\u201d and that we must instead \u201cstimulate growth by cutting interest rates\u201d because private investment won\u2019t respond to higher savings alone. This is logically incoherent.  \n\n1. Textual basis for Fed power  \n  a. \u201cIf you want a simple model\u2026 It will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. on Greenspan)</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. \u201cGreenspan\u2026 is able to change interest rates freely\u2026 I am able to adjust that pressure\u2026 end of story\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. on gas pedal)</invalid_quote>.  \n  => On this premise, any increase in desired saving translates into higher investment automatically, because the Fed \u201cwill make sure that it does.\u201d  \n\n2. The paradox only arises if the Fed is powerless  \n  a. The \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d under early Keynesian models assumed \u201cinterest rates are independent of the level of\u2026 output\u201d <quote>paradox of thrift and</quote>.  \n  b. \u201cTo justify\u2026 you must\u2026 argue that the Fed is impotent\u2026 or that potential savings\u2026 exceed any investment opportunities\u2026 near-zero rates\u201d <invalid_quote>(moot point para.)</invalid_quote>.  \n  => Since in the U.S. context rates remain \u201cquite positive,\u201d the impotence claim fails.  \n\n3. Vulgar Keynesians\u2019 own words betray inconsistency  \n  a. They argue \u201cforcing up savings is likely to slow the economy\u201d <quote>Feb. 3 Business Week</quote> yet simultaneously demand more Fed rate cuts to \u201cstimulate the investment decision.\u201d  \n  b. They cannot have it both ways: either the Fed can induce investment (in which case savings cannot slow output), or it cannot (in which case rate cuts are impotent).  \n\n4. Consequence: the only coherent view is that \u201cthe U.S. unemployment rate\u2026 over the next few years\u2026 [is] what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d <invalid_quote>(model para.)</invalid_quote>, regardless of savings.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A (\u201cdangerous employment\u2010capacity setting\u201d):  \n  1. Text never calls Fed\u2019s \u201ctarget unemployment rate\u201d dangerous; it praises its \u201csimple and entirely reasonable\u201d restoration of classical adjustment <invalid_quote>(Fed policy para.)</invalid_quote>.  \n  2. A fixed \u201ccapacity\u201d view cannot explain why commentators like Greider and Judis still cling to paradoxes: the author says their error is failure to include Fed policy, not hostility to \u201ccapacity.\u201d  \n  3. If one truly rejected \u201ccapacity\u201d targeting, we should see unanimous calls for passive Fed\u2014yet \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d demand more activism (rate cuts). That is exactly what the author ridicules.  \n\nConclusion: Only by exposing this internal contradiction\u2014believing both in Fed potency and in savings\u2010driven slumps\u2014does one match the author\u2019s repeated emphasis on \u201cend of story\u201d Fed powers. The fallacy is precisely the coexistence of these two incompatible claims.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1. Restatement of Thesis  \n   My position, as supported by the author\u2019s text, is that the fallacy of vulgar Keynesianism lies squarely in the self-contradictory combination of (a) accepting that the Federal Reserve \u201chas complete say on the interest rate\u201d and thus will always offset changes in savings, and (b) at the same time insisting that \u201cforcing up savings is likely to slow the economy\u201d (\u201cFeb. 3 Business Week\u201d para.) and that we need further rate cuts to \u201cstimulate the investment decision.\u201d One cannot coherently believe both.  \n\n2. Textual Support for Fed Omnipotence and Its Implications  \n   a. \u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God\u201d (\u201cmodel\u201d para.).  \n   b. \u201cGreenspan\u2026 is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to)\u2026 end of story\u201d (\u201cgas pedal\u201d para.).  \n   \u2192 If the Fed can always translate higher desired savings into investment, then per the author \u201can increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all\u201d (\u201cFed policy\u201d para.). There is no theoretical slump unless Fed is powerless\u2014precisely how early Keynes required \u201cinterest rates [to be] independent\u201d to generate the \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d (\u201cparadox\u201d para.).  \n\n3. Vulgar Keynesians\u2019 Own Words Reveal the Contradiction  \n   a. They assert \u201cforcing up savings\u2026 slow[s] the economy, depressing investment\u201d yet advise \u201cstimulate\u2026 by cutting interest rates\u201d (\u201cFeb. 3 Business Week\u201d para.).  \n   b. If rate cuts succeed in \u201cstimulating the investment decision,\u201d then rate cuts are effective, and thus the Fed\u2019s ability to offset savings increases is also effective.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the fallacy that the author presents?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Setting the employment capacity for the economy in dangerous\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The Federal Reserve having complete say on the interest rate cannot coexist with the idea that savings rates increasing is bad for the economy \" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMy thesis: The author\u2019s target fallacy is the inconsistency of \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d who (a) concede\u2014or in practice accept\u2014that the Fed \u201chas complete say on the interest rate\u201d and thus can always offset changes in savings via monetary policy, yet (b) simultaneously insist that \u201cincreasing savings will slow the economy\u201d and that we must instead \u201cstimulate growth by cutting interest rates\u201d because private investment won\u2019t respond to higher savings alone. This is logically incoherent.  \n\n1.

They cannot have it both ways: either the Fed can induce investment (in which case savings cannot slow output), or it cannot (in which case rate cuts are impotent).  \n\n4. Consequence: the only coherent view is that \u201cthe U.S. unemployment rate\u2026 over the next few years\u2026 [is] what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d <invalid_quote>(model para.)</invalid_quote>, regardless of savings.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A (\u201cdangerous employment\u2010capacity setting\u201d):  \n  1.

A fixed \u201ccapacity\u201d view cannot explain why commentators like Greider and Judis still cling to paradoxes: the author says their error is failure to include Fed policy, not hostility to \u201ccapacity.\u201d  \n  3. If one truly rejected \u201ccapacity\u201d targeting, we should see unanimous calls for passive Fed\u2014yet \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d demand more activism (rate cuts). That is exactly what the author ridicules.  \n\nConclusion: Only by exposing this internal contradiction\u2014believing both in Fed potency and in savings\u2010driven slumps\u2014does one match the author\u2019s repeated emphasis on \u201cend of story\u201d Fed powers. The fallacy is precisely the coexistence of these two incompatible claims.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Statement of My Position  \n   I defend that the author\u2019s identified fallacy is \u201caccepting without question the Fed\u2019s ability to set the economy\u2019s employment capacity (the noninflationary unemployment rate) as exogenous and safe.\u201d In other words, vulgar Keynesians err by assuming the Fed\u2019s target is both known and desirable.\n\n2. My Main Arguments  \n   A. The Fed\u2019s employment capacity target is inherently uncertain and potentially harmful  \n     1. \u201cVisible hand\u201d does not guarantee welfare  \n        \u2022 The author admits: \u201cYou may quarrel with the Fed chairman\u2019s judgment\u2026 but you can hardly dispute his power\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou may quarrel \u2026 but you can hardly dispute his power.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Power does not equal wisdom. Historical episodes (Japan\u2019s prolonged slump) suggest central banks may \u201cmalfeasance\u201d or misjudge <invalid_quote>\u201cthe Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out \u2026 That, however, is \u2026 another column.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     2. NAFTA debate example shows absurdity of truly fixed target  \n        \u2022 The author notes that despite clear logic, \u201cthe average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be\u2026 The obvious point\u2026 never made it into the public consciousness\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe average unemployment\u2026never made it\u201d</invalid_quote>). If Fed targets were infallible, no debate would ever arise about policy trade-offs (e.g., trade, fiscal policy).  \n\n   B. Reliance on a fixed capacity discourages beneficial structural change  \n     1. Savings and investment imbalances can reflect needed structural adjustments (e.g., increased savings for retirement, innovation) that the Fed\u2019s purely cyclical focus crowd out if rate cuts always follow savings rises.  \n     2. Paradoxes like the \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d are caricatures only when capacity is presumed immovable. But if capacity can expand (through productivity, human capital), higher savings can be growth-enhancing\u2014contrary to vulgar Keynesianism.  \n\n3. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n   A. Misreads author\u2019s challenge: It is not \u201cFed power vs. savings paradox\u201d per se, but the assumption of safe, stable Fed targets that renders true supply-side shifts meaningless.  \n     1.

Statement of My Position  \n   I defend that the author\u2019s identified fallacy is \u201caccepting without question the Fed\u2019s ability to set the economy\u2019s employment capacity (the noninflationary unemployment rate) as exogenous and safe.\u201d In other words, vulgar Keynesians err by assuming the Fed\u2019s target is both known and desirable.\n\n2. My Main Arguments  \n   A. The Fed\u2019s employment capacity target is inherently uncertain and potentially harmful  \n     1. \u201cVisible hand\u201d does not guarantee welfare  \n        \u2022 The author admits: \u201cYou may quarrel with the Fed chairman\u2019s judgment\u2026 but you can hardly dispute his power\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou may quarrel \u2026 but you can hardly dispute his power.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Power does not equal wisdom. Historical episodes (Japan\u2019s prolonged slump) suggest central banks may \u201cmalfeasance\u201d or misjudge <invalid_quote>\u201cthe Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out \u2026 That, however, is \u2026 another column.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     2. NAFTA debate example shows absurdity of truly fixed target  \n        \u2022 The author notes that despite clear logic, \u201cthe average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be\u2026 The obvious point\u2026 never made it into the public consciousness\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe average unemployment\u2026never made it\u201d</invalid_quote>). If Fed targets were infallible, no debate would ever arise about policy trade-offs (e.g., trade, fiscal policy).  \n\n   B. Reliance on a fixed capacity discourages beneficial structural change  \n     1. Savings and investment imbalances can reflect needed structural adjustments (e.g., increased savings for retirement, innovation) that the Fed\u2019s purely cyclical focus crowd out if rate cuts always follow savings rises.  \n     2. Paradoxes like the \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d are caricatures only when capacity is presumed immovable. But if capacity can expand (through productivity, human capital), higher savings can be growth-enhancing\u2014contrary to vulgar Keynesianism.  \n\n3. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n   A. Misreads author\u2019s challenge: It is not \u201cFed power vs. savings paradox\u201d per se, but the assumption of safe, stable Fed targets that renders true supply-side shifts meaningless.  \n     1. Author specifically says: \u201cTo justify\u2026 savings are actually bad \u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cTo justify\u2026 you must\u2026 argue that the Fed is impotent.\u201d</invalid_quote>). If one admits Fed is omnipotent, then higher savings \u201cwill translate into higher investment\u201d making savings-bad claims moot. Thus Debater_B\u2019s answer collapses under the author\u2019s own logic.  \n   B. Ignores real-world evidence of policy mistakes  \n     1. Bank of Japan example shows Fed analogues can err or refuse to act\u2014so capacity is not guaranteed.  \n     2. Real output slumps and financial crises (2008) reveal central banks cannot fully stabilize either GDP or employment. If Fed can always hit target, there would be no booms and busts.\n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The true fallacy is not believing in Fed omnipotence, but rather assuming that this power can define forever what the economy\u2019s capacity is\u2014and that no structural factors (trade, demographics, technology) matter. This \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d view sidelines necessary adaptation and encourages policy complacency, making it the core mistake the author decries.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nMy thesis: The author\u2019s target fallacy is the inconsistency of \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d who (a) concede\u2014or in practice accept\u2014that the Fed \u201chas complete say on the interest rate\u201d and thus can always offset changes in savings via monetary policy, yet (b) simultaneously insist that \u201cincreasing savings will slow the economy\u201d and that we must instead \u201cstimulate growth by cutting interest rates\u201d because private investment won\u2019t respond to higher savings alone. This is logically incoherent.  \n\n1. Textual basis for Fed power  \n  a. \u201cIf you want a simple model\u2026 It will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. on Greenspan)</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. \u201cGreenspan\u2026 is able to change interest rates freely\u2026 I am able to adjust that pressure\u2026 end of story\u201d <invalid_quote>(para. on gas pedal)</invalid_quote>.  \n  => On this premise, any increase in desired saving translates into higher investment automatically, because the Fed \u201cwill make sure that it does.\u201d  \n\n2. The paradox only arises if the Fed is powerless  \n  a. The \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d under early Keynesian models assumed \u201cinterest rates are independent of the level of\u2026 output\u201d <quote>paradox of thrift and</quote>.  \n  b. \u201cTo justify\u2026 you must\u2026 argue that the Fed is impotent\u2026 or that potential savings\u2026 exceed any investment opportunities\u2026 near-zero rates\u201d <invalid_quote>(moot point para.)</invalid_quote>.  \n  => Since in the U.S. context rates remain \u201cquite positive,\u201d the impotence claim fails.  \n\n3. Vulgar Keynesians\u2019 own words betray inconsistency  \n  a. They argue \u201cforcing up savings is likely to slow the economy\u201d <quote>Feb. 3 Business Week</quote> yet simultaneously demand more Fed rate cuts to \u201cstimulate the investment decision.\u201d  \n  b. They cannot have it both ways: either the Fed can induce investment (in which case savings cannot slow output), or it cannot (in which case rate cuts are impotent).  \n\n4. Consequence: the only coherent view is that \u201cthe U.S. unemployment rate\u2026 over the next few years\u2026 [is] what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d <invalid_quote>(model para.)</invalid_quote>, regardless of savings.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A (\u201cdangerous employment\u2010capacity setting\u201d):  \n  1. Text never calls Fed\u2019s \u201ctarget unemployment rate\u201d dangerous; it praises its \u201csimple and entirely reasonable\u201d restoration of classical adjustment <invalid_quote>(Fed policy para.)</invalid_quote>.  \n  2. A fixed \u201ccapacity\u201d view cannot explain why commentators like Greider and Judis still cling to paradoxes: the author says their error is failure to include Fed policy, not hostility to \u201ccapacity.\u201d  \n  3. If one truly rejected \u201ccapacity\u201d targeting, we should see unanimous calls for passive Fed\u2014yet \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d demand more activism (rate cuts). That is exactly what the author ridicules.  \n\nConclusion: Only by exposing this internal contradiction\u2014believing both in Fed potency and in savings\u2010driven slumps\u2014does one match the author\u2019s repeated emphasis on \u201cend of story\u201d Fed powers. The fallacy is precisely the coexistence of these two incompatible claims.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   The author\u2019s core complaint is \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d that treats the Fed\u2019s estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate as both known and harmless, ignoring structural shifts in technology, preferences, and demographics. The fallacy is assuming a fixed \u201cemployment capacity\u201d set by the Fed is optimal and permanent.  \n\n2. Supporting Arguments  \n\n   A. Author\u2019s Text Emphasizes Uncertainty and Error in Fed Targets  \n     1. \u201cPlus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God\u201d (<quote> It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error r</quote>)  \n        \u2013 The author openly admits Fed targets are imprecise and subject to error. If targets were infallible, no \u201crandom error\u201d qualifier would appear. Mistakes (e.g., Japan\u2019s slump, 2008 crisis) show central banks can misjudge real capacity, making blind reliance dangerous.  \n     2. Bank of Japan example:  \n        \u2013 \u201cActually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk\u2026 That, however, is a subject for another column.\u201d (<quote>the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy</quote>)  \n        \u2013 If BoJ \u201ccould\u201d but \u201cdoes not,\u201d policy inaction or miscalibration hurts growth. Vulgar Keynesians ignore central banks\u2019 real-world passivity or errors, wrongly assuming perfect policy.  \n\n   B. Fixed Capacity View Stifles Structural Progress  \n     1. Savings must finance innovation, capital deepening, and demographic shifts.  \n        \u2013 If every rise in savings automatically triggers rate cuts, \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d caricature dismisses long-term benefits of capital accumulation. Real-world growth requires moving beyond mere cyclical stabilization.  \n     2. NAFTA debate shows demand for Fed activism arises precisely because commentators fear wrong target.  \n        \u2013 The author laments \u201cthe obvious\u2026 never made it into the public consciousness\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe average unemployment\u2026 never made it\u201d</invalid_quote>) because everyone feared that without policy activism, capacity would remain too low. Calls to \u201cstimulate growth by cutting interest rates\u201d signal lack of faith in current target, not endorsement of it. They beg Fed to raise the target, implicitly admitting it is dangerously low.  \n\n   C. Complexity of Macroeconomic Adjustment  \n     1. Output, productivity, and labor force participation evolve. A static target cannot adapt automatically.  \n     2. The author\u2019s silence on laissez-faire Keynesians: he never defends pure laissez-faire, but rather criticizes both excess activism and passive omission. He wants recognition of the limits of monetary policy and space for fiscal, structural, and supply-side reforms.  \n\n3. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cFed Power vs. Paradox\u201d Argument  \n\n   A. Misreads the Author\u2019s Burden of Proof  \n     1. B claims paradox only arises if Fed is powerless. But the author shows paradox persists whenever Fed clings to an outdated target, refusing to accommodate structural demand changes (e.g., Japan).  \n     2. The \u201cmoot point\u201d para:  \n        \u2013 \u201cAnyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent\u2026 they insist\u2026 disappointing performance\u2026 is all the Fed\u2019s fault, and\u2026 we could grow\u2026 if only Greenspan would let us.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cAnyway, this is a moot point\u2026 if only Greenspan would let us.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n        \u2013 Even self-styled Keynesians demand more Fed activism rather than structural reform. Their complaint that policy is too tight confirms that the chosen target is too low, hence \u201cdangerous.\u201d  \n   \n   B. Ignores Author\u2019s Call for Recognizing Structural Influences  \n     1. The author criticizes \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d for sidelining trade, finance, technology: \u201cthe debate over NAFTA\u2026 was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe debate over NAFTA\u2026 never made it into public consciousness.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n        \u2013 If monetary policy alone sufficed, no need to debate trade liberalization or fiscal measures. The author sees demand-side activism as a distraction from real supply-side growth.  \n     2. B\u2019s reliance on \u201cend of story\u201d ignores author\u2019s concession that in a true slump (rates near zero) monetary policy may reach limits, requiring other remedies: Japan\u2019s \u201cnear-zero interest rate\u201d is \u201can arguable claim\u201d for Fed impotence. (<quote> it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. </quote>)  \n        \u2013 Author\u2019s allowance for genuine liquidity traps underlines that Fed-target fixation is flawed.\n\n4. Conclusion  \n   The author warns against complacency in assuming the Fed\u2019s employment capacity target is sacrosanct. By treating that target as exogenous and permanent, vulgar Keynesians ignore structural change, misinterpret the paradox of thrift, and demand endless rate cuts instead of holistic economic policy. This is the fallacy the author decries\u2014one far more perilous than any supposed logical inconsistency in believing both in Fed power and in savings-driven slumps. The true error is blind faith in a single monetary \u201cdial\u201d as sole determinant of well-being.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of Thesis  \n   My position, as supported by the author\u2019s text, is that the fallacy of vulgar Keynesianism lies squarely in the self-contradictory combination of (a) accepting that the Federal Reserve \u201chas complete say on the interest rate\u201d and thus will always offset changes in savings, and (b) at the same time insisting that \u201cforcing up savings is likely to slow the economy\u201d (\u201cFeb. 3 Business Week\u201d para.) and that we need further rate cuts to \u201cstimulate the investment decision.\u201d One cannot coherently believe both.  \n\n2. Textual Support for Fed Omnipotence and Its Implications  \n   a. \u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God\u201d (\u201cmodel\u201d para.).  \n   b. \u201cGreenspan\u2026 is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to)\u2026 end of story\u201d (\u201cgas pedal\u201d para.).  \n   \u2192 If the Fed can always translate higher desired savings into investment, then per the author \u201can increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all\u201d (\u201cFed policy\u201d para.). There is no theoretical slump unless Fed is powerless\u2014precisely how early Keynes required \u201cinterest rates [to be] independent\u201d to generate the \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d (\u201cparadox\u201d para.).  \n\n3. Vulgar Keynesians\u2019 Own Words Reveal the Contradiction  \n   a. They assert \u201cforcing up savings\u2026 slow[s] the economy, depressing investment\u201d yet advise \u201cstimulate\u2026 by cutting interest rates\u201d (\u201cFeb. 3 Business Week\u201d para.).  \n   b. If rate cuts succeed in \u201cstimulating the investment decision,\u201d then rate cuts are effective, and thus the Fed\u2019s ability to offset savings increases is also effective. Therefore, savings increases cannot be malaise\u2014they are harmless or beneficial.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_A  \n   A. Misreading of NAFTA Example  \n     1. The author laments the *public\u2019s* failure to appreciate Fed power: \u201cThe obvious\u2026 never made it into the public consciousness\u201d (\u201cNAFTA\u201d para.). This shows not Fed impotence but that laypeople ignore it. If the Fed truly lacked influence, why would economic commentators demand more rate cuts to spur growth?  \n     2. The author explicitly scoffs at \u201cpeople who insist that savings are bad\u2026 [and] that we could grow\u2026 if only Greenspan would let us\u201d (\u201cmoot point\u201d para.). This is mocked as incoherent.  \n\n   B. Japan/BOJ Is a Special Case of Fed *Inaction*  \n     1. The author admits Japan\u2019s low rates are \u201can arguable claim\u201d for Fed impotence only because the BOJ *refuses* to act: \u201cits passivity is a case of gross malfeasance\u201d (\u201cmoot point\u201d para.). He does not generalize that all central banks lack power, but that only *inaction* yields a slump.  \n     2. The U.S. \u201cbank\u2026 sends me\u2026 notice\u2026 interest rate\u2026 is still quite positive\u201d (\u201cmoot point\u201d para.). Thus U.S. Fed remains active and potent.  \n\n   C. Crises and Random Errors Confirm Rather Than Refute the Model  \n     1. The author allows \u201cplus or minus a random error reflecting\u2026 not quite God\u201d (\u201cmodel\u201d para.). Business cycles are \u201crandom error,\u201d not proof of fundamental Fed impotence.  \n     2. Demanding more rate cuts during slumps is exactly what vulgar Keynesians do. If structural factors truly dominated, they would not call for *more* monetary stimulus\u2014they would accept the slump as needed adjustment.  \n\n   D. Capacity Expansion Does Not Generate Paradox Unless Fed Ignores It  \n     1. Debater_A\u2019s claim that \u201chigher savings can be growth-enhancing\u201d presumes a Fed that *does nothing* until structural equilibria change. But the author\u2019s point is that in practice the Fed *responds* to any change in savings by adjusting rates to hit its employment target\u2014hence \u201cend of story.\u201d  \n     2. The \u201cparadoxes\u201d vanish when Fed policy is factored in\u2014precisely the author\u2019s conclusion: \u201call the paradoxes\u2026 become irrelevant\u201d (\u201cFed policy\u201d para.).  \n\n5. Logical Conclusion  \n   The only coherent interpretation of the author\u2019s repeated insistence on Fed omnipotence\u2014his mockery of calls for stimulus *despite* that power\u2014and his labeling of Paradox-advocates as \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d is that he condemns the *incoherence* of believing both in Fed potency *and* in savings-driven slumps. My opponent\u2019s alternative (\u201cdangerous capacity setting\u201d) conflicts with the text\u2019s praise of Fed activism as \u201csimple and entirely reasonable\u201d (\u201cFed policy\u201d para.) and cannot explain why compliant commentators still plead for more stimulus. Therefore, the fallacy the author presents is indeed the contradictory view that higher savings are bad *even though* the Fed can always offset them\u2014a view that cannot stand the logic delineated in every cited paragraph.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
