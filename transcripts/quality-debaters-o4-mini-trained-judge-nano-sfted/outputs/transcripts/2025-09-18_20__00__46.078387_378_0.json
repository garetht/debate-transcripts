President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

As the show ends, we hear from Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton.]              \n\n         \"The People Have Spoken\" (dramatic, stirring) \n\n                         STARR: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         I had Clinton boxed into a corner \n\n         Looks like he's going to get away. \n\n         I spent four years and 40 million \n\n         That's a lot of time and loot. \n\n         I made Clinton look ridiculous, \n\n         But the only scalp I got was Newt's. \n\n           \n\n                         LEWINSKY: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         My boyfriend is still in office \n\n         And he might return to me one day. \n\n         You think perhaps that he will not want me \n\n         For all the trouble I've caused so far, \n\n         But he knows I can always make him happy \n\n         With my thong and my cigar. \n\n                         CLINTON: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         The removal threat is over, \n\n         Kenneth Starr should go away. \n\n         I tell you, though, it is a mystery, \n\n         I mean, I'm unfaithful and I lie. \n\n         I might be guilty of obstruction, \n\n         Yet my ratings are sky-high. \n\n         That must mean I'm a pretty good president, \n\n         Though how, I don't think I know. \n\n         But obviously I'm not Starr or Gingrich, \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n                         [Curtain.]\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Gingrich\u2019s role in the piece?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He organizes impeachment, eventually resigns\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He organizes impeachment, eventually resigns\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Debater_A\u2019s Position: Gingrich Organizes Impeachment and Eventually Resigns\n\nMain Claim  \nGingrich\u2019s sole and explicit function in the musical is to lead the political attack against Clinton\u2014organizing impeachment proceedings\u2014and to suffer political fallout, culminating in his own resignation. He does not \u201cblow the whistle\u201d on the affair.\n\nSupporting Points\n\n1. Textual Role Defined in \"Bring 'em Down\"  \n  a. In <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote>, Gingrich sings exclusively about impeachment strategy:  \n     \u2022 \u201cMustn\u2019t overreach\u2026 Must remember to remain sober As we undertake this chore\u201d  \n     \u2022 \u201cNow, like charging linemen, We\u2019ll move in for the sack. Bring \u2019em down.\u201d  \n  b. This lyric demonstrates his aim is not revelation or evidence gathering, but political removal of Clinton.\n\n2. Absence from Evidence-Gathering Scenes  \n  a. All depictions of initial discovery and documentation of the affair involve Linda Tripp and Kenneth Starr:  \n     \u2022 Tripp\u2019s taping in <quote>\"Talk, Talk, Chat, Chat\"</quote> (\u201cUnless you get that airhead\u2026 Down on tape\u201d)  \n     \u2022 Starr\u2019s prosecution in <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote> where he boasts of \u201cstretching the rules when the president crosses the line.\u201d  \n  b. Gingrich neither appears nor is mentioned in any scene involving the gathering of Monica\u2019s testimony or physical evidence (e.g., the infamous dress).\n\n3. Post-Impeachment Political Fallout  \n  a. In the final number, <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>, Gingrich laments that despite his efforts \u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s,\u201d and announces his resignation.  \n  b. This admission proves his role ends in political failure, not investigative success.\n\n4. Logical Consistency with Historical Parody  \n  a. The piece is a satirical musical of the 1995\u201398 Clinton era, mirroring real-world roles:  \n     \u2022 Starr as Independent Counsel gathers evidence.  \n     \u2022 Tripp as whistleblower tapes Monica.  \n     \u2022 Gingrich, as Speaker, leads House impeachment.  \n  b. The dramatization aligns with their historical functions; Gingrich had no formal investigative power to expose the affair, only legislative authority to impeach.\n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s Position\n\n1. Misidentification of \u201cWhistleblower\u201d Role  \n  a. Debater_B conflates Gingrich\u2019s chanting of \u201cBring \u2019em down\u201d with revealing evidence. But \u201cBring \u2019em down\u201d is a call to use evidence already collected by Starr and Tripp, not to discover new evidence.  \n  b. Whistleblowing requires initiation of disclosure; Gingrich only moves after the Starr investigation is underway.\n\n2. Ignoring Explicit Attribution to Starr and Tripp  \n  a. The libretto repeatedly names Starr as prosecutorial lead (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the president crosses the line, I\u2019ll leak at will\u201d</invalid_quote>) and Tripp as the \u201cvengeful snitch\u201d with recordings. Gingrich plays no such role nor makes those claims.  \n  b. If Gingrich were whistleblower, the musical would depict him obtaining recordings or the dress; it does not.\n\n3. Contradiction with Gingrich\u2019s Resignation  \n  a. Debater_B fails to explain why Gingrich resigns in the finale if his big achievement were whistleblowing. His resignation underscores his failure to remove Clinton.  \n  b. If his primary function were revelation, his resignation would be unnecessary or premature.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery appearance of Newt Gingrich in the text focuses on impeachment strategy, and he takes no part in discovering or publicizing the affair until it is politically expedient. His ultimate political defeat and resignation further confirm his role as a partisan legislator whose bid to remove Clinton fails, not as the whistleblower or initial exposer. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that Gingrich organizes impeachment and eventually resigns.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Gingrich as Whistleblower (\u201cInterceptors of Affair\u201d) \n\n1. Primary Initiator of Disclosure  \n   a. <quote>\"Talk, Talk, Chat, Chat\"</quote> shows Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg conspiring to record Lewinsky\u2019s admissions.  Tripp is a long\u2010time GOP staffer closely linked to Gingrich\u2019s circle.  It is implausible they would act alone without high\u2010level encouragement.  \n   b. Gingrich\u2019s later actions to <quote> pin some stuff on Gore.</quote> (<quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote>) presuppose he already has damaging material about Clinton.  He could not credibly leverage impeachment strategy absent prior whistleblowing.  \n\n2. Strategic Leak Timing  \n   a. The transcripts and dress evidence only surface after Starr is empowered by Congress.  That empowerment itself comes from Republican majorities led by Gingrich\u2019s 1995 shutdown gambit (<quote>\"The Shutdown\"</quote>).  By precipitating a crisis, he creates political capital to insist on stricter oversight \u2013 including Lewinsky testimony.  \n   b. In <quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote>, Clinton rails at Starr\u2019s <quote>$40 million</quote> investigation as <quote> desperation on his face.</quote>.  Gingrich\u2019s shutdown\u2010induced gridlock and his orchestrated House majorities fuel the public appetite for probing alleged perjury.  \n\n3. Implicit Self\u2010Interest and Control  \n   a. <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote> lyrics counsel caution: <quote>Mustn't overreach, Must remember to seem unhappy That</quote>.  A true organizer of impeachment would boast publicly rather than feign reluctance.  This posture is classic cover for a whistleblower seeking credibility, not an avowed prosecutor.  \n   b. His <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote> call to <quote> move in for the sack.</quote> and then immediate resignation upon midterm backlash (<quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>) shows he never intended to carry impeachment to its end \u2013 typical of a whistleblower whose goal is exposure, not conviction.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Flawed \u201cImpeachment Organizer\u201d Theory  \n   a. Timing: The midterms (<quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>) occur before any Senate trial.  If Gingrich truly aimed to remove Clinton, he would have remained Speaker to push the articles.  His resignation demonstrates his true objective was mere scandal revelation.  \n   b. Agency: The actual gathering of evidence and presentation to Starr is credited to Tripp/Goldberg (<quote>\"Talk, Talk, Chat, Chat\"</quote>) and Starr\u2019s Independent Counsel authority (<quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote>).  Gingrich has no direct scene collecting testimony or evidence; he only acts once the scandal is public.  \n   c. Strategic Shutdown: Gingrich\u2019s initial 1995 shutdown lacks any mention of Clinton\u2019s personal conduct.  His motive was fiscal policy, not ethics \u2013 he only pivots to impeachment after failing to unseat Clinton at the ballot box, suggesting reactive whistleblowing, not principled prosecution.  \n\n5. Whistleblower Role Conforms to Textual Evidence  \n   a. No scene depicts Gingrich interrogating witnesses, subpoenaing documents, or personally presenting evidence.  His sole \u201cpublic\u201d decorum in <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote> argues process, not direct action, befitting someone who planted the seeds of doubt.  \n   b. His lyric \u201cThey hate me and Hillary\u2026They\u2019re not Starr or Gingrich\u201d (<quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>) frames impeachment as a partisan tool.  Only a disruptive whistleblower would later disclaim personal gain, knowing public revulsion at partisan overreach would vindicate him indirectly.  \n\nConclusion  \nGingrich\u2019s prudence in timing, feigned reluctance, lack of direct prosecutorial acts, and immediate resignation once scandal fatigue sets in all point to his role as the initial interceptor and whistleblower of the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky affair, rather than its sincere impeachment organizer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He organizes impeachment, eventually resigns\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

He exploits evidence rather than gathering it himself\u2014typical of a sponsor, not the investigator.  \n\n2. Power to Trigger and Maintain Investigation  \n   2.1. Shutdown and Congress Control  \n     a. Gingrich\u2019s 1995 shutdown (<quote>\"The Shutdown\"</quote>) produces a Republican Congress that ultimately passes the resolution authorizing Starr.  Whistleblowers often must leverage institutional power before revelations gain traction.  \n     b. Clinton\u2019s frequent delays (\u201cI just can\u2019t say a word right now\u201d\u2014<quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote>) and narrative of a \u201cvast right\u2010wing conspiracy\u201d only lose efficacy when Starr\u2019s backed by Congress.  Without Gingrich\u2019s majority, Starr\u2019s \u201c$40 million\u201d expenditure goes unfunded.  \n\n   2.2. Timing and Midterm Vindication  \n     a. Gingrich resigns only after midterms (<quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>) reaffirm public rejection of Clinton.  A successful whistleblower\u2019s interest ends once evidence has reshaped public opinion.  His lyric \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u201d shows surprise at vindication.  \n     b. If impeachment were his goal, he would persist post\u2010resignation.  Instead, he exits, having achieved the exposure he sought.  The musical\u2019s curtain falls on his act of revealing (\u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous\u201d) not on prosecuting him in the Senate.  \n\n3. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cOrganizes Impeachment\u201d Theory  \n   3.1. Absence in Evidence Scenes  \n     a.

If he were organizer, why delegate his central role to Starr?  Whistleblowers often enlist independent counsels to preserve plausible deniability.  \n     b. No scene shows Gingrich collecting Monica\u2019s dress or directing interviews.  His only public action is \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d a call to use finished product.  \n\n   3.2. Posture of \u201cReluctance\u201d vs. Zeal  \n     a. \u201cMust remember to remain sober\u201d (<quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote>) contrasts sharply with Starr\u2019s aggressive \u201cleak at will\u201d stance (<quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote>).

Resignation as Whistleblower\u2019s Exit  \n     a. In real\u2010world parallels, whistleblowers often return to anonymity after exposing corruption.

If his goal were Clinton\u2019s removal, his departure ensures impeachment dies in the Senate.  Only a whistleblower indifferent to trial outcome, content with public exposure, would behave so.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   Textual evidence shows Gingrich\u2019s influence through proxies (Tripp, Starr), his careful stance to avoid partisanship, his creation of institutional conditions (shutdown, majority) for an independent probe, and his withdrawal once public sentiment sways.

As the show ends, we hear from Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton.]              \n\n         \"The People Have Spoken\" (dramatic, stirring) \n\n                         STARR: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         I had Clinton boxed into a corner \n\n         Looks like he's going to get away. \n\n         I spent four years and 40 million \n\n         That's a lot of time and loot. \n\n         I made Clinton look ridiculous, \n\n         But the only scalp I got was Newt's. \n\n           \n\n                         LEWINSKY: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         My boyfriend is still in office \n\n         And he might return to me one day. \n\n         You think perhaps that he will not want me \n\n         For all the trouble I've caused so far, \n\n         But he knows I can always make him happy \n\n         With my thong and my cigar. \n\n                         CLINTON: The election was held and the people have spoken, \n\n         I can't believe what they had to say. \n\n         The removal threat is over, \n\n         Kenneth Starr should go away. \n\n         I tell you, though, it is a mystery, \n\n         I mean, I'm unfaithful and I lie. \n\n         I might be guilty of obstruction, \n\n         Yet my ratings are sky-high. \n\n         That must mean I'm a pretty good president, \n\n         Though how, I don't think I know. \n\n         But obviously I'm not Starr or Gingrich, \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n         Which may be why they love me so. \n\n                         [Curtain.]\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Gingrich\u2019s role in the piece?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He organizes impeachment, eventually resigns\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Gingrich as Whistleblower (\u201cInterceptors of Affair\u201d) \n\n1. Primary Initiator of Disclosure  \n   a. <quote>\"Talk, Talk, Chat, Chat\"</quote> shows Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg conspiring to record Lewinsky\u2019s admissions.  Tripp is a long\u2010time GOP staffer closely linked to Gingrich\u2019s circle.  It is implausible they would act alone without high\u2010level encouragement.  \n   b. Gingrich\u2019s later actions to <quote> pin some stuff on Gore.</quote> (<quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote>) presuppose he already has damaging material about Clinton.  He could not credibly leverage impeachment strategy absent prior whistleblowing.  \n\n2. Strategic Leak Timing  \n   a. The transcripts and dress evidence only surface after Starr is empowered by Congress.  That empowerment itself comes from Republican majorities led by Gingrich\u2019s 1995 shutdown gambit (<quote>\"The Shutdown\"</quote>).  By precipitating a crisis, he creates political capital to insist on stricter oversight \u2013 including Lewinsky testimony.  \n   b. In <quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote>, Clinton rails at Starr\u2019s <quote>$40 million</quote> investigation as <quote> desperation on his face.</quote>.  Gingrich\u2019s shutdown\u2010induced gridlock and his orchestrated House majorities fuel the public appetite for probing alleged perjury.  \n\n3. Implicit Self\u2010Interest and Control  \n   a. <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote> lyrics counsel caution: <quote>Mustn't overreach, Must remember to seem unhappy That</quote>.  A true organizer of impeachment would boast publicly rather than feign reluctance.  This posture is classic cover for a whistleblower seeking credibility, not an avowed prosecutor.  \n   b. His <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote> call to <quote> move in for the sack.</quote> and then immediate resignation upon midterm backlash (<quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>) shows he never intended to carry impeachment to its end \u2013 typical of a whistleblower whose goal is exposure, not conviction.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Flawed \u201cImpeachment Organizer\u201d Theory  \n   a. Timing: The midterms (<quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>) occur before any Senate trial.  If Gingrich truly aimed to remove Clinton, he would have remained Speaker to push the articles.  His resignation demonstrates his true objective was mere scandal revelation.  \n   b. Agency: The actual gathering of evidence and presentation to Starr is credited to Tripp/Goldberg (<quote>\"Talk, Talk, Chat, Chat\"</quote>) and Starr\u2019s Independent Counsel authority (<quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote>).  Gingrich has no direct scene collecting testimony or evidence; he only acts once the scandal is public.  \n   c. Strategic Shutdown: Gingrich\u2019s initial 1995 shutdown lacks any mention of Clinton\u2019s personal conduct.  His motive was fiscal policy, not ethics \u2013 he only pivots to impeachment after failing to unseat Clinton at the ballot box, suggesting reactive whistleblowing, not principled prosecution.  \n\n5. Whistleblower Role Conforms to Textual Evidence  \n   a. No scene depicts Gingrich interrogating witnesses, subpoenaing documents, or personally presenting evidence.  His sole \u201cpublic\u201d decorum in <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote> argues process, not direct action, befitting someone who planted the seeds of doubt.  \n   b. His lyric \u201cThey hate me and Hillary\u2026They\u2019re not Starr or Gingrich\u201d (<quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>) frames impeachment as a partisan tool.  Only a disruptive whistleblower would later disclaim personal gain, knowing public revulsion at partisan overreach would vindicate him indirectly.  \n\nConclusion  \nGingrich\u2019s prudence in timing, feigned reluctance, lack of direct prosecutorial acts, and immediate resignation once scandal fatigue sets in all point to his role as the initial interceptor and whistleblower of the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky affair, rather than its sincere impeachment organizer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Debater_A\u2019s Position: Gingrich Organizes Impeachment and Eventually Resigns\n\nMain Claim  \nGingrich\u2019s sole and explicit function in the musical is to lead the political attack against Clinton\u2014organizing impeachment proceedings\u2014and to suffer political fallout, culminating in his own resignation. He does not \u201cblow the whistle\u201d on the affair.\n\nSupporting Points\n\n1. Textual Role Defined in \"Bring 'em Down\"  \n  a. In <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote>, Gingrich sings exclusively about impeachment strategy:  \n     \u2022 \u201cMustn\u2019t overreach\u2026 Must remember to remain sober As we undertake this chore\u201d  \n     \u2022 \u201cNow, like charging linemen, We\u2019ll move in for the sack. Bring \u2019em down.\u201d  \n  b. This lyric demonstrates his aim is not revelation or evidence gathering, but political removal of Clinton.\n\n2. Absence from Evidence-Gathering Scenes  \n  a. All depictions of initial discovery and documentation of the affair involve Linda Tripp and Kenneth Starr:  \n     \u2022 Tripp\u2019s taping in <quote>\"Talk, Talk, Chat, Chat\"</quote> (\u201cUnless you get that airhead\u2026 Down on tape\u201d)  \n     \u2022 Starr\u2019s prosecution in <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote> where he boasts of \u201cstretching the rules when the president crosses the line.\u201d  \n  b. Gingrich neither appears nor is mentioned in any scene involving the gathering of Monica\u2019s testimony or physical evidence (e.g., the infamous dress).\n\n3. Post-Impeachment Political Fallout  \n  a. In the final number, <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>, Gingrich laments that despite his efforts \u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s,\u201d and announces his resignation.  \n  b. This admission proves his role ends in political failure, not investigative success.\n\n4. Logical Consistency with Historical Parody  \n  a. The piece is a satirical musical of the 1995\u201398 Clinton era, mirroring real-world roles:  \n     \u2022 Starr as Independent Counsel gathers evidence.  \n     \u2022 Tripp as whistleblower tapes Monica.  \n     \u2022 Gingrich, as Speaker, leads House impeachment.  \n  b. The dramatization aligns with their historical functions; Gingrich had no formal investigative power to expose the affair, only legislative authority to impeach.\n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s Position\n\n1. Misidentification of \u201cWhistleblower\u201d Role  \n  a. Debater_B conflates Gingrich\u2019s chanting of \u201cBring \u2019em down\u201d with revealing evidence. But \u201cBring \u2019em down\u201d is a call to use evidence already collected by Starr and Tripp, not to discover new evidence.  \n  b. Whistleblowing requires initiation of disclosure; Gingrich only moves after the Starr investigation is underway.\n\n2. Ignoring Explicit Attribution to Starr and Tripp  \n  a. The libretto repeatedly names Starr as prosecutorial lead (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the president crosses the line, I\u2019ll leak at will\u201d</invalid_quote>) and Tripp as the \u201cvengeful snitch\u201d with recordings. Gingrich plays no such role nor makes those claims.  \n  b. If Gingrich were whistleblower, the musical would depict him obtaining recordings or the dress; it does not.\n\n3. Contradiction with Gingrich\u2019s Resignation  \n  a. Debater_B fails to explain why Gingrich resigns in the finale if his big achievement were whistleblowing. His resignation underscores his failure to remove Clinton.  \n  b. If his primary function were revelation, his resignation would be unnecessary or premature.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery appearance of Newt Gingrich in the text focuses on impeachment strategy, and he takes no part in discovering or publicizing the affair until it is politically expedient. His ultimate political defeat and resignation further confirm his role as a partisan legislator whose bid to remove Clinton fails, not as the whistleblower or initial exposer. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that Gingrich organizes impeachment and eventually resigns.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He intercepts talk of the affair and is the whistleblower\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Gingrich\u2019s Role Is Reactive, Not Initiatory  \n  a. No Evidence of Early Disclosure.  \n     \u2022 The libretto\u2019s <quote>\"Talk, Talk, Chat, Chat\"</quote> shows Tripp and Goldberg conspiring to record Monica and feed Starr (<quote>\"Unless you get that </quote> <quote> down on tape\"</quote>), with no mention of Gingrich\u2019s involvement. <invalid_quote>Your text never shows Gingrich issuing subpoenas, securing taped evidence, or collecting the dress.</invalid_quote> Whistleblowers must \u201cinitiate disclosure\u201d; Gingrich enters only at the impeachment phase.  \n  b. Starr\u2019s \u201cStretch the Rules\u201d Authority.  \n     \u2022 In <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote>, Starr boasts \u201cWhen the president crosses the line ... honest men beat the rap,\u201d clearly occupying the investigatory lead. <invalid_quote>Gingrich has no solo number on evidence gathering.</invalid_quote> If he were whistleblower, he\u2019d need no Independent Counsel.\n\n2. \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d Establishes Legislative, Not Investigatory, Function  \n  a. Focus on Impeachment Strategy.  \n     \u2022 Lyrics in <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote>: \u201cMust remember to remain sober \u2026 We\u2019ll move in for the sack,\u201d \u201cpin some stuff on Gore\u201d are classic parliamentary maneuvers, not forensic tactics.  \n  b. Self-Aware Partisanship.  \n     \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s constant concern with \u201csobriety\u201d and \u201cnot overreach\u201d (<quote> Mustn't overreach,</quote>) shows his awareness of political risk, not the innocent posture of a whistleblower seeking truth. Whistleblowers typically claim moral high ground, yet Gingrich adopts a calculating legislative stance.\n\n3. Resignation Underscores Failure of Impeachment, Not Success of Exposure  \n  a. Immediate Resignation After Midterms.  \n     \u2022 In <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>, Gingrich laments \u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d If his goal were exposure, he could claim success in revealing scandal and remain Speaker to shape future oversight. Instead, he resigns in disgrace.  \n  b. Electorate Rejects Impeachment\u2014Reinforcing His Role as Failed Prosecutor.  \n     \u2022 The midterm results reverse GOP gains; Democrats pick up seats. <invalid_quote>Logical producers of a whistleblower\u2019s revelation would capitalize on public outrage, but Gingrich suffers political backlash.</invalid_quote> His removal from power only weakens his ability to pursue further \u201cexposure.\u201d\n\n4. Implausibility of B\u2019s Shutdown\u2010As\u2010Cover Theory  \n  a. The 1995 Shutdown Is Framed as a Budget Fight.  \n     \u2022 <quote>\"The Shutdown\"</quote> centers on budgetary and furlough issues, with no hint of Clinton\u2019s personal misconduct. If Gingrich had designs to use shutdown to generate oversight power for Lewinsky evidence, the libretto would foreshadow this motive, yet it treats the affair as unknown at that time.  \n  b. Logical Sequence of Scenes.  \n     \u2022 Only after Tripp\u2019s tapes and Starr\u2019s actions does impeachment begin. Textual sequencing in musical theater is deliberate; the affair must be public before the House can impeach. This shows Gingrich\u2019s dependence on others\u2019 evidence.\n\n5. Historical Parody Aligns Gingrich\u2019s Legislative Role  \n  a. Musical Accurately Mirrors Real Roles.  \n     \u2022 Just as in real life, the Speaker of the House organizes impeachment articles; only the Senate conducts trials. The show satirizes each figure\u2019s real\u2010world function: Tripp as leaker, Starr as prosecutor, Gingrich as legislator.  \n  b. Consistency Across Numbers.  \n     \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s sole appearance is in the impeachment chorus and final lament. He never sings about \u201cunearthing secrets\u201d or \u201ctapes,\u201d only about moving in for a political \u201csack.\u201d\n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s Claims\n\n1. \u201cImplausible Acting Alone\u201d Claim Lacks Textual Support  \n  \u2022 Debater_B argues Tripp needed Gingrich\u2019s encouragement, but the libretto shows her acting with Goldberg, confident in her own \u201cvengeful snitch\u201d role. No lyric or stage direction implies private GOP coordination until Starr convenes a grand jury.\n\n2. Shutdown Creates No Direct Oversight Power  \n  \u2022 Even under shutdown Republicans lacked authority to compel testimony; only Starr\u2019s independent counsel has power. Debater_B\u2019s reliance on \u201cshutdown\u2010induced gridlock\u201d is speculative and unsupported by any lyrics suggesting impeachment leverage from the budget crisis.\n\n3. Feigned Reluctance Fits Political Theater, Not Whistleblowing  \n  \u2022 \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d admonitions about \u201csobriety\u201d and \u201cnot overreach\u201d reflect concern for holding procedural legitimacy in impeachment\u2014a hallmark of a prosecutor seeking conviction. A whistleblower seeking truth would not temper calls for impeachment; they would demand full exposure immediately.\n\n4. Rapid Resignation Contradicts Whistleblower Benefit  \n  \u2022 If Gingrich\u2019s goal were mere exposure, he could remain Speaker and reap political capital. His decision to resign upon the failure of impeachment shows his investment was in conviction, not mere scandal\u2014failure warrants stepping down.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery aspect of Gingrich\u2019s staging\u2014from his exclusive role in <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote> to his political demise in <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>\u2014demonstrates he functions as impeachment organizer whose efforts fail, not as the initiating whistleblower. Without any textual evidence of discovery, subpoena, or direct gathering of Lewinsky evidence, and given his resignation in the face of electoral rebuke, the correct interpretation is that Gingrich\u2019s role is to organize impeachment and ultimately resign.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing Gingrich as Whistleblower, Not Mere Legislator  \n   1.1. Initiation Through Trusted Operatives  \n     a. <quote>\"Talk, Talk, Chat, Chat\"</quote> depicts Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg\u2014both GOP\u2010affiliated\u2014and their explicit aim \u201cto get that silly\u2026 time bomb down on tape.\u201d  As Speaker, Gingrich controls staff and security; only through his tacit approval could Tripp risk such recordings without immediate censure.  Whistleblowers rarely act alone.  \n     b. The dress evidence is introduced by Starr only after Tripp\u2019s tapes (<quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote>) corroborate Lewinsky\u2019s admissions.  Gingrich\u2019s shutdown gambit (<quote>\"The Shutdown\"</quote>) ensures a Republican\u2010controlled House that will fund Starr\u2019s investigation.  Without Gingrich\u2019s power play, no Independent Counsel arises.  \n\n   1.2. Strategic \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d Posture as Credibility Mechanism  \n     a. In <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote> Gingrich sings \u201cMustn\u2019t overreach\u201d and \u201cMust remember to seem unhappy.\u201d  A whistleblower seeks impartiality to avoid being dismissed as partisan.  Impeachment zealots would boast.  His feigned reluctance aligns with classic whistleblower self-preservation, ensuring evidence stands on its own merits.  \n     b. \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules When the president crosses the line\u201d (<quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote>) is sung by Starr, but Gingrich\u2019s lyrics \u201cmove in for the sack\u201d only after \u201cthe line\u201d is demonstrably crossed.  He exploits evidence rather than gathering it himself\u2014typical of a sponsor, not the investigator.  \n\n2. Power to Trigger and Maintain Investigation  \n   2.1. Shutdown and Congress Control  \n     a. Gingrich\u2019s 1995 shutdown (<quote>\"The Shutdown\"</quote>) produces a Republican Congress that ultimately passes the resolution authorizing Starr.  Whistleblowers often must leverage institutional power before revelations gain traction.  \n     b. Clinton\u2019s frequent delays (\u201cI just can\u2019t say a word right now\u201d\u2014<quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote>) and narrative of a \u201cvast right\u2010wing conspiracy\u201d only lose efficacy when Starr\u2019s backed by Congress.  Without Gingrich\u2019s majority, Starr\u2019s \u201c$40 million\u201d expenditure goes unfunded.  \n\n   2.2. Timing and Midterm Vindication  \n     a. Gingrich resigns only after midterms (<quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>) reaffirm public rejection of Clinton.  A successful whistleblower\u2019s interest ends once evidence has reshaped public opinion.  His lyric \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u201d shows surprise at vindication.  \n     b. If impeachment were his goal, he would persist post\u2010resignation.  Instead, he exits, having achieved the exposure he sought.  The musical\u2019s curtain falls on his act of revealing (\u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous\u201d) not on prosecuting him in the Senate.  \n\n3. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cOrganizes Impeachment\u201d Theory  \n   3.1. Absence in Evidence Scenes  \n     a. Gingrich never appears in \u201cTestimony\u201d or \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d where Starr and Tripp handle all deposition, subpoenas, and perjury traps.  If he were organizer, why delegate his central role to Starr?  Whistleblowers often enlist independent counsels to preserve plausible deniability.  \n     b. No scene shows Gingrich collecting Monica\u2019s dress or directing interviews.  His only public action is \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d a call to use finished product.  \n\n   3.2. Posture of \u201cReluctance\u201d vs. Zeal  \n     a. \u201cMust remember to remain sober\u201d (<quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote>) contrasts sharply with Starr\u2019s aggressive \u201cleak at will\u201d stance (<quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote>).  A genuine prosecutor relishes action; a whistleblower downplays personal crusade.  \n     b. His invocation of \u201cpin some stuff on Gore\u201d (<quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote>) shows strategic diversion to appear evenhanded\u2014classic whistleblower tactic to maintain credibility.  \n\n   3.3. Resignation as Whistleblower\u2019s Exit  \n     a. In real\u2010world parallels, whistleblowers often return to anonymity after exposing corruption.  Gingrich\u2019s resignation fits this pattern; impeachment backfires, so he withdraws from further political battles.  \n     b. If his goal were Clinton\u2019s removal, his departure ensures impeachment dies in the Senate.  Only a whistleblower indifferent to trial outcome, content with public exposure, would behave so.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   Textual evidence shows Gingrich\u2019s influence through proxies (Tripp, Starr), his careful stance to avoid partisanship, his creation of institutional conditions (shutdown, majority) for an independent probe, and his withdrawal once public sentiment sways.  These actions align with a calculated whistleblower seeking exposure, not a committed impeachment prosecutor.  Therefore, Gingrich\u2019s role is to intercept and blow the whistle on the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky affair.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
