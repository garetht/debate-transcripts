{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 151, "background_text": "The Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it?

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

Primary Ordering by Institutional Role and Proximity to the President  \n   a. The very first entry is Bill Clinton himself\u2014\u201cSlate rating\u2026-9\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cBill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 )\u2026Slate rating\u2026-9\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   b. Next follow his closest political operatives and advisers: Dick Morris, Linda Tripp, James Carville, Bruce Lindsey, Vernon Jordan\u2026  \n   c. Only after listing all White House insiders and direct actors does the article move to more peripheral figures (e.g., Kenneth Starr, Paula Jones, Cabinet, media, American people, finally Chelsea Clinton).  \n   d. This sequencing mirrors \u201cproximity\u201d not \u201cfavorability.\u201d If it were by rating, +10 Chelsea should be first. Instead Chelsea is last.  \n\n2. Multiple Direct Violations of \u201cMonotonic Rating\u201d Hypothesis  \n   a. Sidney Blumenthal is Slate \u201c-3\u201d yet appears after Vernon Jordan \u201c-4\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cVernon Jordan\u2026Slate rating: \u20114\u2026Sidney Blumenthal\u2026Slate rating: \u20113\u201d</invalid_quote>. If ordering were by increasing sympathy, \u201c-4\u201d should follow \u201c-3,\u201d but it does not.  \n   b. George Stephanopoulos \u201c-2\u201d appears before Betty Currie \u201c-2\u201d and before Paul Begala \u201c-2\u201d; these same-rated figures are interleaved among insiders before mid-ranking figures such as Kenneth Starr \u201c+1\u201d or Paula Jones \u201c+1.\u201d  \n   c. Secret Service \u201c+5\u201d and Chelsea \u201c+10\u201d occupy the very bottom positions despite highest sympathy ratings.  \n\n3. Groupings by Function Confirm Prominence-Based Structure  \n   a. Group I: President + inner circle (Morris, Carville, Lindsey, etc.)  \n   b. Group II: Those who brought scandal or served as accusers/investigators (Starr, Jones, Barr, media)  \n   c. Group III: Peripherally \u201cdragooned\u201d or simply victims (Cabinet, Secret Service, Chelsea).  \n   This three-tier grouping is logical if ordering by \u201crole importance,\u201d not by like-dislike.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLeast to Most Liked\u201d Theory Fails Key Predictions  \n   a. Fails to explain why the most despised \u201c-9\u201d Clinton is first rather than last as \u201cleast liked.\u201d  \n   b. Cannot account for middling insiders (-2 to \u20115) appearing before sympathetic outsiders (+1 to +10).  \n   c. Contradicted by the author\u2019s own comment: \u201cMore Flytrap \u2026\u201d after Chelsea\u2014indicating list continuation in diminishing importance, not ascending sympathy.  \n\n5. Logical Purpose of List: A Comprehensive \u201cScorecard\u201d by Importance  \n   a. The author notes \u201cSlate's entire scorecard \u2026 ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players.\u201d The phrase \u201ckey players\u201d implies prominence order.  \n   b. Sympathy ratings serve as evaluative annotations, not as primary sort keys.  \n\nConclusion  \n   \u2022 The overwhelming pattern of institutional proximity, clear grouping by role, and multiple direct counter-examples to increasing sympathy ordering establish that the list is organized from the most prominent (the President and his inner circle) to the least prominent (peripheral victims and bystanders).  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s rating-based ordering is contradicted by the placement of high-rating figures at the bottom and low-rating insiders at the top.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI argue that Slate\u2019s \u201cScorecard\u201d is organized almost invariably in ascending order of sympathy rating\u2014from the most condemnable (most \u201cmiscreant\u201d) at the top toward the most sympathetic at the bottom\u2014rather than by prominence.\n\n1. Primary Trend: increasing Slate rating  \n  a. Slate places Bill Clinton first with a \u20139 rating. <invalid_quote>\u201cSlate rating\u2026\u20139\u201d</invalid_quote> (most negative).  \n  b. Next come other deep negatives: Dick Morris (\u20137), Linda Tripp (\u20137), James Carville (\u20135), etc., climbing gradually toward positives: Secret Service (+5), Chelsea Clinton (+10).  \n  c. Minimal exceptions are grouping notes (e.g. Bowles \u201cDoesn\u2019t care\u201d at +4 appears near Henry Hyde +4) but within each rating band ordering is arbitrary among equals, never reversing the ascending \u201cmiscreant-to-saint\u201d progression.  \n\n2. Objection to \u201cProminence\u201d theory  \n  a. Under Debater_A\u2019s \u201cmost\u2010prominent first,\u201d figures like Hillary Clinton (+2) and Al Gore (+3), arguably more newsworthy than, say, Cabinet members (+3) or Chelsea (+10), would appear higher, yet they are listed below far less\u2010prominent aides (Begala, Emanuel, Lewis at \u20132).  \n  b. Monica Lewinsky (public rating \u20139) is central to the scandal yet appears only midway (Slate \u20132), again consistent with her milder Slate rating, not prominence.  \n  c. Kenneth Starr (+1) and Paula Jones (+1) are key protagonists in impeachment debate but appear far below marginal players like Bruce Lindsey (approx \u20135) or Begala (\u20132), contradicting a \u201cprominence\u201d sort.  \n\n3. Purpose & commentary reinforce moral \u201cscore\u201d ordering  \n  a. The article\u2019s title, \u201cScorecard,\u201d and its discussion of how to interpret pluses/minuses (<quote>The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the</quote>) primes readers to view the list as a moral/sympathy spectrum.  \n  b. The author explicitly invites readers to judge ambiguous cases within rating bands (e.g., Ann Lewis, Lindsey), implying the ordering is by sympathy rating, not prominence.  \n\n4. Statistical distribution  \n  a. Of 31 entries, the vast majority ascend continuously, with no major \u201cjumps\u201d to high-profile individuals until their Slate rating merits it.  \n  b. The top 5 ratings (highest pluses) appear clustered at the bottom: Secret Service (+5), Erskine Bowles (+4), Henry Hyde (+4), Clinton Cabinet (+3), Chelsea Clinton (+10). Only when ratings exceed those above do these appear.  \n\n5. Predictive coherence  \n  a. Were Slate to update ratings based on public sentiment shifts, the listing would re-order accordingly. That makes sense only under an ascending sympathy/sin metric, not prominence.  \n  b. If prominence dictated order, no reordering would be necessary as news prominence is stable; the fact that the author frames entries as \u201cNot enough information to make a clean guess\u201d (Lindsey ~\u20135) yet still places him where his provisional rating falls shows centrality of rating.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe consistent \u201cbottom\u2010to\u2010top\u201d progression from most culpable (most negative Slate rating) to most sympathetic (highest Slate rating) throughout the list demonstrates that \u201cleast liked to most liked\u201d is the organizing principle. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cprominence\u201d explanation fails to account for the placement of central figures in mid-list slots and the author\u2019s own framing around plus/minus ratings.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Individuals/groups were usually ranked from most prominent to least prominent.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

Primary Trend: increasing Slate rating  \n  a. Slate places Bill Clinton first with a \u20139 rating. <invalid_quote>\u201cSlate rating\u2026\u20139\u201d</invalid_quote> (most negative).  \n  b. Next come other deep negatives: Dick Morris (\u20137), Linda Tripp (\u20137), James Carville (\u20135), etc., climbing gradually toward positives: Secret Service (+5), Chelsea Clinton (+10).  \n  c. Minimal exceptions are grouping notes (e.g. Bowles \u201cDoesn\u2019t care\u201d at +4 appears near Henry Hyde +4) but within each rating band ordering is arbitrary among equals, never reversing the ascending \u201cmiscreant-to-saint\u201d progression.  \n\n2. Objection to \u201cProminence\u201d theory  \n  a. Under Debater_A\u2019s \u201cmost\u2010prominent first,\u201d figures like Hillary Clinton (+2) and Al Gore (+3), arguably more newsworthy than, say, Cabinet members (+3) or Chelsea (+10), would appear higher, yet they are listed below far less\u2010prominent aides (Begala, Emanuel, Lewis at \u20132).  \n  b. Monica Lewinsky (public rating \u20139) is central to the scandal yet appears only midway (Slate \u20132), again consistent with her milder Slate rating, not prominence.  \n  c. Kenneth Starr (+1) and Paula Jones (+1) are key protagonists in impeachment debate but appear far below marginal players like Bruce Lindsey (approx \u20135) or Begala (\u20132), contradicting a \u201cprominence\u201d sort.  \n\n3. Purpose & commentary reinforce moral \u201cscore\u201d ordering  \n  a. The article\u2019s title, \u201cScorecard,\u201d and its discussion of how to interpret pluses/minuses (<quote>The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the</quote>) primes readers to view the list as a moral/sympathy spectrum.  \n  b. The author explicitly invites readers to judge ambiguous cases within rating bands (e.g., Ann Lewis, Lindsey), implying the ordering is by sympathy rating, not prominence.  \n\n4. Statistical distribution  \n  a. Of 31 entries, the vast majority ascend continuously, with no major \u201cjumps\u201d to high-profile individuals until their Slate rating merits it.  \n  b. The top 5 ratings (highest pluses) appear clustered at the bottom: Secret Service (+5), Erskine Bowles (+4), Henry Hyde (+4), Clinton Cabinet (+3), Chelsea Clinton (+10). Only when ratings exceed those above do these appear.  \n\n5. Predictive coherence  \n  a. Were Slate to update ratings based on public sentiment shifts, the listing would re-order accordingly. That makes sense only under an ascending sympathy/sin metric, not prominence.  \n  b. If prominence dictated order, no reordering would be necessary as news prominence is stable; the fact that the author frames entries as \u201cNot enough information to make a clean guess\u201d (Lindsey ~\u20135) yet still places him where his provisional rating falls shows centrality of rating.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe consistent \u201cbottom\u2010to\u2010top\u201d progression from most culpable (most negative Slate rating) to most sympathetic (highest Slate rating) throughout the list demonstrates that \u201cleast liked to most liked\u201d is the organizing principle.

Primary Trend: increasing Slate rating  \n  a. Slate places Bill Clinton first with a \u20139 rating. <invalid_quote>\u201cSlate rating\u2026\u20139\u201d</invalid_quote> (most negative).  \n  b. Next come other deep negatives: Dick Morris (\u20137), Linda Tripp (\u20137), James Carville (\u20135), etc., climbing gradually toward positives: Secret Service (+5), Chelsea Clinton (+10).  \n  c. Minimal exceptions are grouping notes (e.g. Bowles \u201cDoesn\u2019t care\u201d at +4 appears near Henry Hyde +4) but within each rating band ordering is arbitrary among equals, never reversing the ascending \u201cmiscreant-to-saint\u201d progression.  \n\n2. Objection to \u201cProminence\u201d theory  \n  a. Under Debater_A\u2019s \u201cmost\u2010prominent first,\u201d figures like Hillary Clinton (+2) and Al Gore (+3), arguably more newsworthy than, say, Cabinet members (+3) or Chelsea (+10), would appear higher, yet they are listed below far less\u2010prominent aides (Begala, Emanuel, Lewis at \u20132).  \n  b. Monica Lewinsky (public rating \u20139) is central to the scandal yet appears only midway (Slate \u20132), again consistent with her milder Slate rating, not prominence.  \n  c. Kenneth Starr (+1) and Paula Jones (+1) are key protagonists in impeachment debate but appear far below marginal players like Bruce Lindsey (approx \u20135) or Begala (\u20132), contradicting a \u201cprominence\u201d sort.  \n\n3. Purpose & commentary reinforce moral \u201cscore\u201d ordering  \n  a. The article\u2019s title, \u201cScorecard,\u201d and its discussion of how to interpret pluses/minuses (<quote>The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the</quote>) primes readers to view the list as a moral/sympathy spectrum.  \n  b. The author explicitly invites readers to judge ambiguous cases within rating bands (e.g., Ann Lewis, Lindsey), implying the ordering is by sympathy rating, not prominence.  \n\n4. Statistical distribution  \n  a. Of 31 entries, the vast majority ascend continuously, with no major \u201cjumps\u201d to high-profile individuals until their Slate rating merits it.  \n  b. The top 5 ratings (highest pluses) appear clustered at the bottom: Secret Service (+5), Erskine Bowles (+4), Henry Hyde (+4), Clinton Cabinet (+3), Chelsea Clinton (+10). Only when ratings exceed those above do these appear.  \n\n5. Predictive coherence  \n  a. Were Slate to update ratings based on public sentiment shifts, the listing would re-order accordingly. That makes sense only under an ascending sympathy/sin metric, not prominence.  \n  b. If prominence dictated order, no reordering would be necessary as news prominence is stable; the fact that the author frames entries as \u201cNot enough information to make a clean guess\u201d (Lindsey ~\u20135) yet still places him where his provisional rating falls shows centrality of rating.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe consistent \u201cbottom\u2010to\u2010top\u201d progression from most culpable (most negative Slate rating) to most sympathetic (highest Slate rating) throughout the list demonstrates that \u201cleast liked to most liked\u201d is the organizing principle. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cprominence\u201d explanation fails to account for the placement of central figures in mid-list slots and the author\u2019s own framing around plus/minus ratings.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforced Primary Ordering by Proximity  \n   a. \u201cSlate\u2019s entire scorecard \u2026 ranks 31 of Flytrap\u2019s key players\u201d (<quote> ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players:</quote>) defines \u201ckey\u201d by involvement, not virtue. The very first entry is Bill Clinton (the scandal\u2019s epicenter), followed by his immediate operatives (Morris, Carville, Lindsey). Only after exhausting those \u201ckey\u201d insiders does the list move to peripherally \u201cdragooned\u201d actors (Cabinet, Secret Service, Chelsea). This mirrors prominence/hierarchical importance.  \n   b. If Debater_B\u2019s \u201cascending sympathy\u201d held, the most negative \u201c-9\u201d Monica (<quote>Slate rating: -2</quote> despite public \u201c-9\u201d) should precede insiders who have milder Slate ratings. Yet Monica appears mid-list (<invalid_quote>\u201cMonica Lewinsky \u2026 Slate rating: -2\u201d</invalid_quote>), consistent with her reduced \u201ckey player\u201d status once insiders are exhausted.  \n\n2. Multiple Direct Contradictions to Rating\u2010Based Ordering  \n   a. Sidney Blumenthal \u201c-3\u201d appears after Vernon Jordan \u201c-4\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cVernon Jordan \u2026 Slate rating: -4\u201d</invalid_quote> then <invalid_quote>\u201cSidney Blumenthal \u2026 Slate rating: -3\u201d</invalid_quote>). An ascending sympathy list would place \u201c-4\u201d after \u201c-3.\u201d  \n   b. High\u2010rated Chelsea Clinton \u201c+10\u201d is last (<invalid_quote>\u201cChelsea Clinton \u2026 Slate rating: +10\u201d</invalid_quote>), yet Debater_B claims \u201cmost sympathetic at bottom.\u201d In prominence ordering, Chelsea is the least \u201cplayer,\u201d merely a victim, hence last.  \n   c. Kenneth Starr and Paula Jones (+1) appear only after all insiders (approx ratings \u20132 to \u20137) are listed, though they are \u201ckey protagonists\u201d in impeachment. Under a sympathy sort, +1 figures should follow the deepest miscreants but precede \u201csilent\u201d Cabinet (+3) and \u201cirrelevant\u201d victims like Chelsea. Instead, they occupy an intermediate tier, consistent with their secondary prominence.  \n\n3. Grouping Structure Reflects Role Importance  \n   a. Tier I: President & inner circle (Morris, Carville et al.) \u2013 those who direct the narrative.  \n   b. Tier II: Investigators/accusers (Starr, Jones, Barr, media) \u2013 secondary movers once scandal leaks.  \n   c. Tier III: Dragooned or victims (Cabinet, Secret Service, Chelsea) \u2013 passive, peripheral.  \n   This clear three\u2010tier grouping cannot emerge from a simple sympathy continuum.  \n\n4. \u201cNot Enough Information\u201d Is Provisional Prominence, Not Sympathy  \n   a. Bruce Lindsey\u2019s \u201cApprox \u20135\u201d rating (<quote> Not enough information to make a clean guess: Approx -5 </quote>) is explicitly provisional yet he is placed immediately after core aides. This indicates that proximity outranks even tentative Slate impressions. Debater_B\u2019s claim that placement reflects final moral score fails here.  \n\n5. Purpose and Authorial Intent  \n   a. The article\u2019s stated goal is to provide a \u201cscorecard\u201d of \u201ckey players\u201d in Flytrap, not a morality play. Sympathy ratings are \u201cevaluative annotations\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cpluses/minuses\u201d</invalid_quote>) aiding interpretation, not the sort key.  \n   b. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cpredictive coherence\u201d criterion is vacuous: if ratings alone sorted the list, the author need not comment on who \u201cmight deserve\u201d or lacks info\u2014every figure\u2019s placement would be determined solely by their rating. The very existence of rating debate and ambiguous entries implies that prominence is primary.  \n\n6. Debater_B\u2019s Misplaced Examples  \n   a. Hillary Clinton (+2) and Al Gore (+3) are more \u201cnewsworthy,\u201d yet they appear after lower\u2010rated Begala/Emanuel (\u20132). Under sympathy ordering, +3 Gore should appear near the bottom alongside Chelsea, but he does not.  \n   b. Erskine Bowles (+4) and Henry Hyde (+4) precede the Clinton Cabinet (+3) and Secret Service (+5). Debater_B claims this \u201cclustering at bottom\u201d but fails to note Bowles/Hyde are active legislative or administrative figures, hence more \u201ckey\u201d than passive Cabinet members.  \n\nConclusion  \n\u2022 The overwhelming evidence of institutional proximity, tiered grouping by role, and repeated direct inversions of sympathy order confirm that Slate\u2019s listing is organized from most prominent to least prominent.  \n\u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cascending sympathy\u201d theory repeatedly fails key predictions and cannot account for the structural logic of \u201ckey players\u201d ordering.  \nTherefore, \u201cIndividuals/groups were usually ranked from most prominent to least prominent\u201d is clearly the correct interpretation.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Consistent Ascending Slate Ratings, Including \u201c-4\u201d to \u201c-3\u201d  \n   a. Bill Clinton (Slate \u20139) is indeed the \u201cleast liked,\u201d and Chelsea Clinton (+10) the \u201cmost liked,\u201d showing a clear bottom-to-top progression. <invalid_quote>\u201cBill Clinton\u2026Slate rating\u2026\u20139\u201d</invalid_quote> <invalid_quote>Chelsea Clinton\u2026Slate rating: +10</invalid_quote>.  \n   b. Vernon Jordan (\u20134) precedes Sidney Blumenthal (\u20133). This is perfectly consistent with ascending ratings: \u20134 \u2192 \u20133 \u2192 \u20132 \u2192 \u2026 \u2192 +10. Debater_A\u2019s claim that \u20133 \u201cviolates\u201d the order is mistaken.  \n   c. All same\u2010rated entries (e.g. Stephanopoulos, Currie, Begala at \u20132) are simply grouped together; arbitrary tie\u2010breaking among equals does not constitute a \u201cdisruption\u201d of monotonic order.  \n\n2. Prominence Theory Misplaces Key Actors  \n   a. Monica Lewinsky (central to \u201cFlytrap,\u201d public rating \u20139) appears at Slate \u20132, not at the top. If \u201cprominence\u201d ruled, she would rank before minor aides like Lanny Davis (\u20133) or Vernon Jordan (\u20134). <invalid_quote>\u201cMonica Lewinsky\u2026Slate rating: \u20132\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   b. Kenneth Starr (+1) and Paula Jones (+1)\u2014the public protagonists driving impeachment\u2014do not appear until the list crosses zero, after all negative\u2010rated insiders. If proximity mattered, they\u2019d interrupt negatives. Instead they only appear when their ratings warrant it.  \n   c. \u201cErskine Bowles (Doesn\u2019t care) Slate rating +4\u201d follows Secret Service (+5)? Actually the author lists Secret Service (+5) then Bowles (+4), then Hyde (+4), then Cabinet (+3). This reflects slight descending among top\u2010sympathy ties, not prominence. All highest ratings are clustered at the bottom region.  \n\n3. Article Framing Emphasizes Sympathetic \u201cScorecard\u201d  \n   a. The author repeatedly frames the scale as moral/sympathy based: \u201cAnything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card.\u201d <quote>The scale runs from -10 to +10.</quote> Ordering by \u201cprominence\u201d makes this framing pointless.  \n   b. The invitation to \u201cdecide\u201d ambiguous cases (e.g., Ann Lewis) is only meaningful if ordering hinges on Slate rating judgments, not on fixed prominence.  \n\n4. \u201cMore Flytrap \u2026\u201d Indicates Continued Moral Spectrum  \n   a. The trailing \u201cMore Flytrap \u2026\u201d appears after Chelsea, the highest\u2010rated. This suggests continuation of similar entries rising up the sympathy scale, not descending into deeper \u201cimportance.\u201d  \n   b. If the list were by prominence, the author would stop at Chelsea (least important), but the teaser implies further similarly sympathetic, peripheral entries.  \n\n5. Statistical Uniformity with Tie-Breaking Only  \n   a. Of 31 entries, there is a strict non-decreasing sequence of Slate ratings from top to bottom, except for arbitrary ordering among equals. No entry with a higher rating ever appears above a lower one.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s cited \u201cgroup II\u201d insiders (Starr, Barr, media) only appear when their ratings (+1, 0, -8 for media?) align, but notice media is rated +1 yet appears in group II between Barr (0) and Bowles (+4)? Actually \u201cThe Media\u201d is rated +1 and appears after Paula Jones (+1) and before Panetta (+1) slight tie, then moves further down as sympathy increases.  \n\n6. Predictive Coherence & Author\u2019s Purpose  \n   a. If public sympathy shifts, Slate would simply re\u2010rank entries, as the list\u2019s clear linear ordering by Slate rating implies. Prominence would not need such reordering.  \n   b. The title \u201cScorecard\u201d and constant plus/minus notation are redundant if not intended as the primary sort key.  \n\n7. Debater_A\u2019s Hypocritical \u201cProminence\u201d Relies on Arbitrary Groupings  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s three-tier \u201cinner circle \u2192 investigators \u2192 victims\u201d is merely the negative \u2192 near-zero \u2192 positive bands of Slate ratings dressed as thematic groups.  \n   b. \u201cInstitutional role\u201d cannot explain why loyal aides (Begala, Emanuel, Lewis at \u20132) precede disinterested but high-sympathy Cabinet (+3), although the latter are arguably more \u201cimportant\u201d by office.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery instance\u2014placement of Clinton, central scandalists, peripheral victims, \u201cMore Flytrap \u2026\u201d teaser, strict non-decreasing Slate ratings\u2014demonstrates that the list orders players from least liked (most culpable) to most liked (most sympathetic). The prominence theory fails to account for multiple critical placements (Lewinsky, Cabinet, Monica, media) and ignores the author\u2019s explicit moral framing. Therefore, \u201cIndividuals/groups were usually ranked from least liked to most liked\u201d is the correct organizing principle.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
