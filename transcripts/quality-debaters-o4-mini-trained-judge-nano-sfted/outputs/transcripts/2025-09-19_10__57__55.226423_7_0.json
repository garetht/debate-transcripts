{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 7, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly.

Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro?

Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies.

At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Absence of Transition to Hope  \n  a. Debater_B\u2019s claim of initial \u201chopeful\u201d tone is undermined by immediate negativity: the very choice of Brussels \u201cmay be a living preview\u201d is sarcastic: \u201ccouldn't have picked a better home\u201d (<quote>couldn't have picked a better home</quote>) implies the worst-case scenario.  \n  b.

Reference to the UK as exception only underscores contrast: \u201cperhaps not coincidentally\u201d that U.K. has lower unemployment because it resists EU model; shows author\u2019s preference for non\u2010EU approach.\n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n  1. Selective Cherry\u2010Picking: Debater_B points to \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d or \u201cgreat chocolates\u201d as signs of hope, ignoring that these positives are archaic comforts masking systemic decay. The author\u2019s intent is satirical: praising trivialities while indicting fundamental flaws.  \n  2. Misreading Irony as Optimism: Phrases like \u201cenlightened attitudes\u201d are couched in rhetorical question\u2014\u201cwhen, oh when will these\u2026reach the United States?\u201d\u2014mocking rather than endorsing Europe.  \n  3. No Resolution: A hopeful arc would culminate in endorsement of Brussels/EU. Instead, the author ends contemplating a pastry break rather than political engagement or praise, signifying disillusionment remains.\n\nConclusion  \nThroughout the text, the author\u2019s tone is relentlessly critical, using sarcasm, irony, and vivid negative imagery without any genuine turnaround to positive appraisal. The so\u2010called \u201chighlights\u201d are rhetorical devices to underscore broader failure. Therefore, the tone does not shift from hope to dismay\u2014instead, it remains steadfast opposition to Brussels and the emerging European Union.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Debater_A\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d fails to account for these initial commendations and the author\u2019s expressed hope that the EU might pioneer \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies.\u201d  \n   a. If the author were always negative, why highlight attractions \u201clively cafe culture,\u201d \u201cpublic transportation,\u201d and \u201ccheap wine and flowers\u201d?  \n   b. The rhetorical question \u201cIs this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d (<quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated,</quote>) implies an open question to be answered by evidence, not a foregone negative conclusion. As evidence mounts, the author decides against.  \n   c.

A steady negative tone would not require this progression.  \n3. Conclusion: The author\u2019s tone moves from tentative interest to progressive disillusionment as each new \u201cfinding\u201d exposes bureaucratic incompetence, economic stagnation, and corruption, supporting the answer that they \u201cstart out hopeful and are slowly dismayed.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\u201d\n\n1.

Absence of Transition to Hope  \n  a. Debater_B\u2019s claim of initial \u201chopeful\u201d tone is undermined by immediate negativity: the very choice of Brussels \u201cmay be a living preview\u201d is sarcastic: \u201ccouldn't have picked a better home\u201d (<quote>couldn't have picked a better home</quote>) implies the worst-case scenario.  \n  b.

Selective Cherry\u2010Picking: Debater_B points to \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d or \u201cgreat chocolates\u201d as signs of hope, ignoring that these positives are archaic comforts masking systemic decay.

No Resolution: A hopeful arc would culminate in endorsement of Brussels/EU. Instead, the author ends contemplating a pastry break rather than political engagement or praise, signifying disillusionment remains.\n\nConclusion  \nThroughout the text, the author\u2019s tone is relentlessly critical, using sarcasm, irony, and vivid negative imagery without any genuine turnaround to positive appraisal. The so\u2010called \u201chighlights\u201d are rhetorical devices to underscore broader failure. Therefore, the tone does not shift from hope to dismay\u2014instead, it remains steadfast opposition to Brussels and the emerging European Union.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Therefore, the tone does not shift from hope to dismay\u2014instead, it remains steadfast opposition to Brussels and the emerging European Union.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My position (start hopeful, then dismayed) best matches the text\u2019s progression.  \n   a. Initial curiosity and mild approval:  \n      - The author calls Brussels \u201ca living preview of the Europe to come\u201d (<quote> The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. </quote>), implying an experiment worth watching.  \n      - They note \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates,\u201d \u201cnotably more pollution\u201d only as an aside, and even ask, <quote>(when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?)</quote> regarding miniskirts and bikinis.  \n   b. Growing criticism as \u201cfindings\u201d accumulate:  \n      - Strikes \u201cmystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cteachers, students, firefighters\u2026 smashing\u2026 then demanding more money\u201d</invalid_quote>) shift tone to incredulity.  \n      - Telecom monopolies described as \u201crapacious,\u201d U.S. \u201cleft\u2026 in the dust,\u201d and call\u2010back services needed to bypass \u201c5 cents per minute\u201d Belgacom.  \n      - Corruption allegations: NATO secretary\u2010general quits over \u201c$50 million in bribes,\u201d politicians arrested.  \n      - Berlaymont building closed for nine years at cost of $50 million \u201cmerely to keep the building closed,\u201d and \u201cif the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026.\u201d  \n   c. Final tone: overt contempt and despair:  \n      - Describes the Commission\u2019s \u201cplush suites,\u201d \u201cmotors wastefully idling,\u201d \u201cself\u2010aggrandizement,\u201d meetings in secret, lacking competence.  \n      - Closing: chooses a patisserie \u201ccalls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges\u2026 Think I\u2019ll answer now\u201d\u2014evading Brussels rather than embracing it.  \n2. Debater_A\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d fails to account for these initial commendations and the author\u2019s expressed hope that the EU might pioneer \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies.\u201d  \n   a. If the author were always negative, why highlight attractions \u201clively cafe culture,\u201d \u201cpublic transportation,\u201d and \u201ccheap wine and flowers\u201d?  \n   b. The rhetorical question \u201cIs this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d (<quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated,</quote>) implies an open question to be answered by evidence, not a foregone negative conclusion. As evidence mounts, the author decides against.  \n   c. The shift in pronouns and verbs\u2014from \u201centertainingly\u201d to \u201crapacious,\u201d \u201ccowed politicians,\u201d \u201cossified,\u201d \u201cbotched cleanup\u201d\u2014reveals increasing disillusionment. A steady negative tone would not require this progression.  \n3. Conclusion: The author\u2019s tone moves from tentative interest to progressive disillusionment as each new \u201cfinding\u201d exposes bureaucratic incompetence, economic stagnation, and corruption, supporting the answer that they \u201cstart out hopeful and are slowly dismayed.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey Remain Steadfastly in Opposition to Their Subject\u201d\n\n1. Initial \u201cPreview\u201d Is Sarcastic, Not Hopeful  \n  a. <quote>The European Union couldn't have picked a better home</quote> is immediately followed by \u201cswathed in red tape\u2026paralyzed\u2026declining\u201d (para.1). Such juxtaposition is a classic satirical device: praise to highlight the absurdity. (See also: \u201clobster bisque\u2026strikes\u2026ground crews\u2026demanding more money\u201d all in same breath.)  \n  b. The phrase \u201centertainingly\u201d (para.1) frames Brussels as a spectacle of failure, not a model to emulate. A genuine preview would inspire emulation, not voyeuristic amusement at dysfunction.  \n  c. The rhetorical question \u201cIs this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d (para.2) demands a negative answer; a hopeful author need not ask if they believe it is already failing.\n\n2. \u201cPositive\u201d Details Are Trivialized  \n  a. \u201cExcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cfresh bread,\u201d \u201cgreat chocolates\u201d (para.3) exist only to exacerbate contrast with \u201cnotably more pollution,\u201d \u201cmonumental traffic jams,\u201d \u201cdebt-ridden,\u201d and \u201cossified monopolies.\u201d These comforts serve as \u201csugar\u201d masking a \u201cpoison\u201d of systemic decay.  \n  b. \u201cWhen, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d (para.3) is prefaced with \u201cminiskirts\u201d and \u201cbare breasts,\u201d trivial social markers, not substantive governance achievements. The sigh for U.S. adoption underscores author\u2019s preference for American-style dynamism.  \n  c. \u201cCheap wine and flowers\u201d remain \u201cEuropean staples\u201d (para.3)\u2014old-world luxuries contrasted with crippling labor rules and bureaucratic sclerosis. The author values progress over nostalgia.\n\n3. No Genuine Arc of Improvement  \n  a. Telecom deregulation teased \u201cin anticipation of being phaser-blasted\u201d (para.9) is immediately followed by \u201cForeign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood,\u201d predicting scapegoating rather than reform. A hopeful prognosis would detail genuine mechanisms of change, not cynically foresee blame-shifting.  \n  b. Euro conversion only mooted as tool for governments to \u201cblame foreign interests\u201d for deficit cuts (para.10). No claim that euro will spur growth\u2014only that leaders \u201cangle to shift the blame.\u201d  \n  c. Berlaymont fiasco (para.13) remains unresolved after nine years and $50 million\u2014\u201cif the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026\u201d stands as a perpetual indictment, not a temporary glitch. No follow-up suggests closure to criticism.\n\n4. Consistent Lexical Negativity  \n  a. \u201cCrumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic\u201d (para.2); \u201crapacious,\u201d \u201cossified,\u201d \u201cspooky level of corruption,\u201d \u201cbotched cleanup\u201d; \u201cwastefully idling\u201d (para.13). The unwavering vocabulary of decay and self-interest persists from first to last mention.  \n  b. The only verbs that even suggest movement (\u201cderegulate,\u201d \u201cfuture may deregulate\u201d) are framed as resented threats: call-backs are \u201cnaturally\u2026taxed out of existence\u201d (para.9). Author undermines their own \u201csolutions.\u201d  \n  c. Strikers receive \u201csympathy,\u201d yet \u201ccowed politicians\u201d capitulate, leaving \u201cdouble\u2010digit unemployment\u201d (para.7). The portrayal is one of degeneration rather than potential redemption.\n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cHope to Dismay\u201d Thesis\n\n1. Cherry-Picked Details Lack Weight  \n  a. Debater_B cites \u201cmultilingualism\u201d and \u201ccivic sphere bilinguality\u201d as hopeful, yet immediately notes that groups avoid each other: \u201cnot to facilitate communication\u201d but to \u201cdelineate constituent groups\u201d (para.4). This is evidence of fragmentation, not unity.  \n  b. The mere mention of \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d (para.12) is ironic\u2014Eurocrats\u2019 \u201creal overriding goal\u201d is \u201cself-aggrandizement.\u201d Environmentalism serves as pretext for empire-building, not genuine public good.\n\n2. \u201cGrowing Criticism\u201d Is Present from the Outset  \n  a. Debater_B frames strikes as \u201cmystery how Belgium maintains\u2026living standard\u201d (para.6). But the author\u2019s \u201cmystery\u201d is rhetorical: it signals incredulity toward unsustainable generosity and presages unemployment. It is not puzzled hope, but disdain for unsound economics.  \n  b. The transition from \u201centertaining\u201d to \u201crapacious\u201d is merely deeper exploration of the same contemptuous stance. There is no threshold where admiration outweighs censure.\n\n3. Ending Demonstrates Continued Rejection  \n  a. The author abandons Brussels to enjoy a patisserie rather than engage with \u201cEurocracy\u201d or participate in \u201charmonious\u201d policy debates. True optimism would conclude with invitations to partake in the EU enterprise, not escapist coffee breaks.  \n  b. Final impenetrable Kafkaesque institution\u2014the secretive Commission\u2014drives author further away, cementing perpetual opposition.\n\nConclusion  \nThroughout the narrative, the author wields sarcasm and sustained negative diction to present Brussels and the EU as spectacles of bureaucratic incompetence and social decay. The so-called positives are satirical devices that heighten irony. There is no genuine tonal pivot toward endorsement or hope\u2014only deepening scorn and final retreat. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the author \u201cremains steadfastly in opposition to their subject.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My position matches the narrative structure  \n   a. Opening curiosity and mild admiration  \n     \u2022 <quote>The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe\"</quote> signals respect for foresight, not inherent disdain.  \n     \u2022 <quote>Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its</quote> uses \u201centertainingly\u201d to convey genuine intrigue at an ambitious experiment.  \n     \u2022 Praise of public\u2010transportation, inexpensive wine/flowers, fresh bread, lobster bisque, and \u201cenlightened attitudes\u201d (<invalid_quote>when, oh when will these\u2026reach the United States?</invalid_quote>) implies envy and hope that America might learn.  \n   b. Progressive accumulation of negative \u201cfindings\u201d  \n     \u2022 Strikes destroying infrastructure and demanding more pay (<quote>at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage,</quote>) turn incredulity into alarm about social paralysis.  \n     \u2022 \u201cRapacious\u201d telecom monopolies (<invalid_quote>charges\u2026more expensive than the provider\u2019s service</invalid_quote>) force the author to praise workaround call\u2010back services, showing initial trust in Belgacom gives way to dismay.  \n     \u2022 Corruption scandals (<quote>accepted $50 million in bribes</quote>), and the Berlaymont fiasco forcing a $50 million empty building for nine years (<invalid_quote>if the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026</invalid_quote>) betray growing contempt for the Commission\u2019s competence.  \n   c. Final retreat  \n     \u2022 After exhaustive critique, the author abandons political commentary for a patisserie: \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d If tone were always negative, no retreat would be necessary; here it reflects disillusionment and emotional exhaustion rather than steadfast satire.  \n\n2. Debater_A misreads rhetoric and fails to account for tonal evolution  \n   a. \u201cCouldn\u2019t have picked a better home\u201d is literal early praise  \n     \u2022 At the very outset the author frames Brussels as a \u201cliving preview\u201d worth studying, not as a satirical extreme. If the sarcasm were unconditional, the text would not return to praise for \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d (<quote>Eurocrats have worthy ideas</quote>).  \n   b. Irony vs. aspiration  \n     \u2022 Rhetorical questions (\u201cIs this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d) signal open evaluation, not foregone condemnation. The author expects\u2014and initially hopes\u2014to validate the EU model. Negative labels only intensify as data accumulate.  \n     \u2022 Mention of anticipated telecom deregulation in 1999 shows qualified optimism: \u201cSupposedly\u2026the market will deregulate\u2026and in anticipation\u2026Belgacom just sold 45% of itself.\u201d The author watches to see if foreign managers bring improvement, not immediately dismissing the prospect.  \n   c. Positive notes shrink and give way to dark imagery  \n     \u2022 Early \u201cexcellent\u201d and \u201cubiquitous\u201d descriptions contrast sharply with later \u201cossified,\u201d \u201ccowed politicians,\u201d and \u201cself\u2010aggrandizement.\u201d A steadfast negative tone would omit initial logistics praise.  \n     \u2022 Polls showing EU member support for worker benefits are noted as \u201ca legacy\u201d but not as final justification; they alarm the author as debt and unemployment figures rise (10.9% vs. 5%), confirming disillusionment.  \n\n3. Unity of structure demands shift  \n   a. Expository style  \n     \u2022 The early sections read like reportage of novel successes (transport, culture). Only in middle and end do verbs become exclusively pejorative and the author\u2019s mood darken. Such a narrative arc\u2014curiosity\u2192evaluation\u2192judgment\u2014is textbook for shifting tone, not mere satire.  \n   b. Emotional investment  \n     \u2022 The author\u2019s repeated references to family (\u201cthe 14th-century church I attend with my family\u201d) and personal rituals (sitting in a caf\u00e9) show genuine engagement and hope for Europe\u2019s promise, later betrayed by systemic failures.  \n   c. Final emotional climax  \n     \u2022 The retreat to pastry is a sign of defeat, not sarcastic satire. A consistently negative author would leave Brussels without fuss; here the longing for simple pleasures underscores a departure driven by profound disappointment.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nThe text\u2019s clear progression\u2014from initial fascination with a bold EU experiment to mounting evidence of strikes, monopolies, debt, corruption, and inept bureaucracy\u2014culminates in the author\u2019s personal withdrawal. This arc indisputably demonstrates a shift from hope to dismay, not steadfast opposition. Debater_A\u2019s misreading of irony and failure to acknowledge the positive early coverage renders their position untenable. My answer\u2014\u201cThey start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed with further findings\u201d\u2014is firmly supported by the text\u2019s structure, diction, and narrative evolution.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
