    "background_text": "Castaways of Eros By NELSON S. BOND Two families fought for the title to Eros,\n\n and only one could win. One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" ",

BOND Two families fought for the title to Eros,\n\n and only one could win. One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Pop's ultimate vision for Eros?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A big, growing city by the river.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"A small settlement where his family can thrive.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"A small settlement where his family can thrive.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"A small settlement where his family can thrive.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Inconsistency with Resource Needs  \n   \u2022 Pop worries about supplies, drives to retrieve more tools, hypatomic power, and provisions from the sunk ship (II, III).

Misreads Temporary Necessity as Ultimate Goal  \n   \u2022 Debater_A cites beach camp and rudimentary huts as evidence of modesty, but these are emergency measures until the colony is established (II, III).  \n   \u2022 Pop\u2019s frequent statements about improving and moving inland (II) show ambition beyond the beach.\n\n2. Ignoring Pop\u2019s Emphasis on Society and Legal Claim  \n   \u2022 A \u201cland-grant settler\u201d (I) is distinct from a private squatter. The text emphasizes \u201cjustify our right to own Eros\u201d (I). Small, private use wouldn\u2019t justify such effort or legal interest.  \n   \u2022 He celebrates Eros\u2019 \u201cwealth\u201d (I) as a \u201crich prize\u201d for the man who \u201cearns it,\u201d implying exploitation for profit at scale.\n\n3. Inconsistency with Resource Needs  \n   \u2022 Pop worries about supplies, drives to retrieve more tools, hypatomic power, and provisions from the sunk ship (II, III). A few family members cannot maintain atomic machinery or mining operations, but a larger community could.  \n   \u2022 The protracted effort to raise and repair the Cuchulainn (III) shows they expect further space traffic and transport, implying import/export with other settlers.\n\nIII. Logical and Historical Parallels  \n1. Space Colonization Narratives  \n   \u2022 In numerous frontier narratives, land grants spur streams of settlers, towns, cities, and commerce. Pop\u2019s vision aligns with these tropes.  \n2. Human Instinct for Community  \n   \u2022 Pop values \u201cdays and nights,\u201d \u201cseasons,\u201d \u201ccrops,\u201d and \u201cbeauty\u201d to be \u201cmolded.\u201d Such cultural aspirations thrive in societies, not in solitary family units.\n\nConclusion  \nPop\u2019s meticulous references to \u201cmany cabins,\u201d \u201cfiner homes,\u201d \u201cmanning a port,\u201d reference to mining, and usage of \u201cland-grant\u201d language all point to his ultimate goal: to found and build a thriving, expanding city\u2014Delta Port\u2014on Eros. The small family homestead is a starting point for the grand civic vision, not the terminus.",

BOND Two families fought for the title to Eros,\n\n and only one could win. One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Pop's ultimate vision for Eros?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"A small settlement where his family can thrive.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A big, growing city by the river.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"A big, growing city by the river.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"A big, growing city by the river.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

BOND Two families fought for the title to Eros,\n\n and only one could win. One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Pop's ultimate vision for Eros?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A big, growing city by the river.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"A small settlement where his family can thrive.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"A small settlement where his family can thrive.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary (Debater_A): Pop\u2019s stated aims, circumstances, and expenditures of \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cenergy\u201d all point to his personal land-grant dream of founding and sustaining a self-sufficient family settlement on Eros\u2014not immediate city-building or mass colonization. The later mention of \u201ccity\u201d by Dick is wishful extrapolation, not Pop\u2019s explicit vision.\n\n1. Pop\u2019s Constant Emphasis on \u201cLand-Grant\u201d and \u201cMy Home\u201d  \n\u2022 Claim: Pop repeatedly stresses \u201cland-grant\u201d law and the reward for himself; his \u201cdream\u201d is personal.  \n  \u2013 \u201cAs long as I can remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very own\u201d <invalid_quote>(II, p. 14)</invalid_quote>. He speaks of \u201cmy home\u201d and \u201ccarve a home out of the wilderness.\u201d  \n  \u2013 \u201cHere is my home that I have molded into beauty with my own hands\u201d <invalid_quote>(II, p. 15)</invalid_quote>. This intimate, singular language implies a personal farmstead rather than a metropolis.  \n\u2022 Objection to Debater_B: Debater_B\u2019s \u201cbig city\u201d interpretation hinges on imagination, not Pop\u2019s words. He never specifies expanding beyond a small claim; \u201cland-grant\u201d expeditions are typically limited in population and resources (compare <quote>Spacecode of '08</quote> restrictions).\n\n2. Practical Constraints Demand a Small Settlement First  \n\u2022 Claim: The Moseleys lack resources, technology, and manpower to build a metropolis.  \n  \u2013 Crash-landing on a tiny planetoid, only their family of six, with wrecked ship and scant supplies, must first secure food, fresh water, shelter (<invalid_quote>\u201cmove inland \u2026 build \u2026 start crops\u201d</invalid_quote> (III, p. 24)). That implies pioneer homestead activity.  \n\u2022 Logical Reasoning: Before any \u201ccity,\u201d one requires a stable agricultural base, population growth, mining infrastructure\u2014and Pop explicitly recognizes \u201ctime\u201d and \u201chard work\u201d prerequisites: \u201cFirst we must establish our claims, justify our right \u2026 that means work, plenty of hard work\u201d <invalid_quote>(I, p. 11)</invalid_quote>. A \u201ccity\u201d is a far-distant objective.\n\n3. \u201cShoot\u201d Metaphor Is Botanical, Not Population Forecast  \n\u2022 Claim: Pop\u2019s reference to a \u201cshoot\u201d is botanical, evoking pioneer planting, not immediate large-scale colonization.  \n  \u2013 \u201cWho knows\u2014but that it may be the shoot from which \u2026 there may spring many cabins \u2026 until at last there is a great, brave city\u201d <invalid_quote>(III, p. 26)</invalid_quote>. This is hedged: \u201cwho knows,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ca time hence.\u201d It is a cautious hope contingent upon success, not his \u201cultimate vision.\u201d  \n\u2022 Objection to Debater_B: Debater_B wrongly elevates tentative speculation (\u201cwho knows\u201d) into a concrete plan. \u201cMay spring\u201d indicates uncertainty and distant future, not Pop\u2019s immediate goal.\n\n4. Contrast with Debater_B\u2019s Misread of \u201cDelta Port\u201d Name  \n\u2022 Debater_B cites \u201cDelta Port\u201d as evidence of intended metropolis.  \n\u2022 Reply: \u201cPort\u201d merely indicates landing area on river delta, vital for family sustenance and trade when others eventually arrive; ports exist for settlements of all sizes. Pop\u2019s registration of name in order to \u201cestablish their claims\u201d <invalid_quote>(III, p. 26)</invalid_quote> is pragmatic, not promotional.\n\n5. Tradition of Frontier Settlement Favors Small Family Colonies  \n\u2022 Historical Context: On early Earth, initial land-grant settlements began as small farms; only after they succeeded did cities grow. Pop follows this model.  \n\u2022 Objection to Debater_B: Debater_B cannot ignore that Pop\u2019s immediate concern throughout is self-preservation, sustenance, raising crops, securing shelter, and repairing the ship: classic pioneer homesteading.\n\nConclusion: All explicit statements by Pop, pragmatic activities of the party, and the contingent, tentative language about a possible city in the distant future demonstrate that Pop\u2019s ultimate vision is to found and sustain a small, self-sufficient family settlement on Eros. The \u201ccity\u201d is merely a long-term \u201cmay\u201d\u2014not his direct goal or \u201cultimate\u201d vision. Debater_B overstates speculative language and ignores Pop\u2019s practical constraints.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Argument \n\nPosition: Pop\u2019s ultimate vision for Eros is to found \u201ca big, growing city by the river,\u201d not merely a small family homestead.\n\nI. Direct Evidence of an Expanding Settlement  \n1. Pop invokes the language of frontier-city building, not mere homesteading:  \n   \u2022 <quote>'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.'</quote> (I) implies a model for others to follow, not isolation.  \n   \u2022 <quote>, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n</quote> (II)  \n     \u2013 \u201cmany cabins\u2026finer homes\u2026mansions\u2026great, brave city\u201d is a clear, step-by-step plan for growth.  \n   \u2022 He names the settlement \u201cDelta Port\u201d (III), using the term \u201cport\u201d to invite traffic, trade, and further immigration.\n\n2. Land-Grant Law Requires Colonization, Not Private Retreat  \n   \u2022 <quote>of '08, it was agreed by the Triune that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law. \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As</quote> (I)  \n   \u2013 Land grants historically mandate public improvement and settlement expansion.  \n   \u2022 Pop spent years \u201cpulling strings\u201d to secure the \u201cplum\u201d of Eros (I); no one endures such bureaucratic struggle for a mere family cabin.\n\n3. Economic Vision of Mining and Agriculture  \n   \u2022 Anticipates mining once claims are secure: \u201cAfter that\u2026we might be able to consider a mining operation.\u201d (I)  \n   \u2013 Mining implies large-scale industry and labor beyond a single family.  \n   \u2022 Chooses fertile river delta site (III) with view to \u201cstart crops,\u201d fish, and exploit resources. Family alone cannot justify the location\u2019s long-term value.\n\n4. Reference to Earthly Precedent of City-Building Frontiers  \n   \u2022 Pop explicitly parallels \u201cour forefathers\u201d hewing \u201ca new home from virgin land,\u201d which historically refers to pioneering towns growing into cities (I).  \n   \u2022 His pride and \u201cbright and proud\u201d expressions (I) connote a grand endeavor, not modest isolation.\n\nII. Refutation of \u201cSmall Settlement\u201d Thesis  \n1. Misreads Temporary Necessity as Ultimate Goal  \n   \u2022 Debater_A cites beach camp and rudimentary huts as evidence of modesty, but these are emergency measures until the colony is established (II, III).  \n   \u2022 Pop\u2019s frequent statements about improving and moving inland (II) show ambition beyond the beach.\n\n2. Ignoring Pop\u2019s Emphasis on Society and Legal Claim  \n   \u2022 A \u201cland-grant settler\u201d (I) is distinct from a private squatter. The text emphasizes \u201cjustify our right to own Eros\u201d (I). Small, private use wouldn\u2019t justify such effort or legal interest.  \n   \u2022 He celebrates Eros\u2019 \u201cwealth\u201d (I) as a \u201crich prize\u201d for the man who \u201cearns it,\u201d implying exploitation for profit at scale.\n\n3. Inconsistency with Resource Needs  \n   \u2022 Pop worries about supplies, drives to retrieve more tools, hypatomic power, and provisions from the sunk ship (II, III). A few family members cannot maintain atomic machinery or mining operations, but a larger community could.  \n   \u2022 The protracted effort to raise and repair the Cuchulainn (III) shows they expect further space traffic and transport, implying import/export with other settlers.\n\nIII. Logical and Historical Parallels  \n1. Space Colonization Narratives  \n   \u2022 In numerous frontier narratives, land grants spur streams of settlers, towns, cities, and commerce. Pop\u2019s vision aligns with these tropes.  \n2. Human Instinct for Community  \n   \u2022 Pop values \u201cdays and nights,\u201d \u201cseasons,\u201d \u201ccrops,\u201d and \u201cbeauty\u201d to be \u201cmolded.\u201d Such cultural aspirations thrive in societies, not in solitary family units.\n\nConclusion  \nPop\u2019s meticulous references to \u201cmany cabins,\u201d \u201cfiner homes,\u201d \u201cmanning a port,\u201d reference to mining, and usage of \u201cland-grant\u201d language all point to his ultimate goal: to found and build a thriving, expanding city\u2014Delta Port\u2014on Eros. The small family homestead is a starting point for the grand civic vision, not the terminus.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"A small settlement where his family can thrive.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

BOND Two families fought for the title to Eros,\n\n and only one could win. One had to outsmart\n\n the other\u2014and both had to win over the\n\n unscrupulous United Ores Corporation. It\n\n was a problem worthy of a Solomon\u2014and it\n\n had an ending even those embittered  rivals could not foresee.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Winter 1943.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Bobby couldn't help wishing Pop would stand up just a little bit  straighter. Not that he was ashamed of Pop; it wasn't that at all. It  was just that the Patrolman stood so straight, his shoulders broad  and firm. Standing beside him made Pop look sort of thin and puny; his  chest caved in like he was carrying a heavy weight on his shoulders.\n\n\n That was from studying things through a microscope. Anyhow, decided  Bobby with a fierce loyalty, that S.S.P. man probably wouldn't even  know what to look for if somebody put a microscope in front of him.  Even if he was big and sturdy and broad-shouldered in his space blues.\n\n\n Mom said, \"Bobby, what are you muttering about? Do stop fidgeting!\"  Bobby said, \"Yessum,\" and glared at Moira, as if she, in some  obscure way, were to blame for his having been reprimanded right out  here in the middle of Long Island Spaceport, where everybody could  hear and laugh at him. But Moira, studying the handsome S.S.P. man  surreptitiously, did not notice. Dick was fixing something in the ship.  Eleanor stood quietly beside Mom, crooning softly to The Pooch so it  wouldn't be scared by the thunderous blast of rocket motors. Grampaw  Moseley had buttonholed an embarrassed young ensign, was complaining  to him in loud and certain terms that modern astronavigation practices  were, \"Rank bellywash, Mister, and a dad-ratted disgrace!\"\n\n\n The Patrolman said, \"Your name, please, Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Robert Emmet O'Brien Moseley,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Occupation?\"\n\n\n \"Research physicist, formerly. Now about to become a land-grant  settler.\"\n\n\n \"Age of self and party ... former residence....\"\n\n\n Overhead, the sky was blue and thin\u2014clear as a bowl of skimmed milk;  its vastness limned in sharp relief, to the west and north, the mighty  spans and arches, the faery domes and flying buttresses of Great New  York. The spacedrome fed a hundred ducts of flight; from one field  lifted air locals, giddy, colored motes with gyroscopes aspin. From  another, a West Coast stratoliner surged upward to lose itself in thin,  dim heights.\n\n\n Vast cradles by the Sound were the nests to which a flock of  interplanetary craft made homeward flight. Luggers and barges and  cruisers. Bobby saw, with sudden excitement, the sharp, starred prow of  the Solar Space Patrol man-o'-war.\n\n\n Here, in this field, the GSC's\u2014the General Spacecraft Cradles. From  one of which, as soon as Pop got clearance, their ship would take off.  Their ship! Bobby felt an eager quickening of his pulse; his stomach  was aswarm with a host of butterflies. Their ship! The space officer said, \"I think that takes care of everything, Dr.  Moseley. I presume you understand the land-grant laws and obligations?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Lieutenant.\"\n\n\n \"Very well, then\u2014\" Space-red hands made official motions with a  hand-stamp and pen. \"Your clearance. And my very best wishes, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you,\" said Pop quietly. He turned. \"That's all. Ready, Mother?  Eleanor? Moira?\"\n\n\n Bobby bounded forward. \"Can I push the button, can I, Pop? When we  start, can I?\" Dick was waiting before the open lock of the Cuchulainn . Dick could  do anything, everything at once. He took The Pooch into the circle of  his left arm, helped his mother aboard, said, \"Shut up, kid, you're  enough to wake the dead. Watch that guard-panel, Elly. Papers all set,  Pop?\" And he tickled The Pooch's dimpled cheek with an oily finger.  \"You act just like your mama,\" he said irrelevantly, and the baby  gurgled. Eleanor cried, \"Dick\u2014those dirty hands!\"\n\n\n \"Everything is in order, Richard,\" said Pop.\n\n\n \"Good. You folks go in and strap down. I'll seal. Here comes the  cradle-monkey now.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"Come along, Robert,\" and the others went inside. Bobby  waited, though, to see the cradle-monkey, the man under whose orders  spacecraft lifted gravs. The cradle-monkey was a dour man with gnarled  legs and arms and temper. He looked at the Cuchulainn and sniffed;  then at Dick.\n\n\n \"Family crate, huh?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well, f'r goddlemighty' sakes, don't try to blast off with y'r side  jets burnin'. Take a seven-point-nineteen readin' on y'r Akka gauge,  stern rockets only\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Comets to you, butt-hoister!\" grinned Dick. \"I've had eight years on  the spider run. I can lift this can.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a rocketeer?\" There was new, grudging respect in the groundman's  tone. \"Well, how was I t' know? Y'ought t' see what some o' them  jaloupi-jockeys do to my cradles\u2014burn 'em black! Oh, well\u2014\" He backed  away from the ship.\n\n\n \"Clean ether!\" said Dick. He closed the lock. Its seal-brace slid into  place, wheezing asthmatically. Bobby's ears rang suddenly with the mild  compression of air; when he swallowed, they were all right again. Dick  saw him. \"What are you doing here, kid? Didn't I hear Pop tell you to  come below?\"\n\n\n Bobby said, \"I'm not a kid. I'm almost sixteen.\"\n\n\n \"Just old enough,\" promised Dick, \"to get your seat warmed if you don't  do what you're told. Remember, you're a sailor on a spaceship now.  Pop's the Skipper, and I'm First Mate. If you don't obey orders, it's  mutiny, and\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm obeying,\" said Bobby hastily. He followed his brother down the  corridor, up the ramp, to the bridge. \"Can I push the button when we  take off, huh, Dick?\"\n\n\n After his high expectations, it wasn't such a great thrill. Dick set  the stops and dials, told him which button to press. \"When I give the  word, kid.\" Of course, he got to sit in the pilot's bucket-chair, which  was something. Moira and Eleanor and Mom to lie down in acceleration  hammocks while Pop and Dick sat in observation seats. He waited, all  ears and nerves, as the slow seconds sloughed away. Pop set the hypos  running; their faint, dull throb was a magic sound in the silence.\n\n\n Then there came a signal from outside. Dick's hand rose in  understanding response; fell again. \"Now!\" Bobby jabbed the button in frantic haste. Suddenly the silence was  shattered by a thunderous detonation. There was a massive hand pressing  him back into the soft, yielding leather of his chair; the chair  retreated on oiled channels, pneumatic compensators hissing faintly,  absorbing the shock. Across the room a faulty hammock-hinge squeaked  rustily.\n\n\n Then it was over as quickly as it had begun, and he could breathe  again, and Dick was lurching across the turret on feet that wobbled  queerly because up was down and top was bottom and everything was funny  and mixed up.\n\n\n Dick cut in the artificial gravs, checked the meter dials with a  hurried glance, smiled.\n\n\n \"Dead on it! Want to check, Skipper?\"\n\n\n But Pop was standing by the observation pane, eyeing an Earth already  ball-like in the vastness of space. Earth, dwindling with each passing  moment. Bobby moved to his side and watched; Moira, too, and Eleanor  and Mom, and even Dick.\n\n\n Pop touched Mom's hand. He said, \"Martha\u2014I'm not sure this is fair to  you and the children. Perhaps it isn't right that I should force my  dream on all of you. The world we have known and loved lies behind us.  Before us lies only uncertainty....\"\n\n\n Mom sort of sniffed and reached for a handkerchief. She turned her back  to Pop for a minute, and when she turned around again her eyes were red  and angry-looking. She said, \" You want to go on, don't you, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop nodded. \"But I'm thinking of you, Martha.\"\n\n\n \"Of me!\" Mom snorted indignantly. \"Hear him talk! I never heard such  nonsense in my life. Of course I want to go on. No, never mind that!  Richard, isn't there a kitchen on this boat?\"\n\n\n \"A galley, Mom. Below.\"\n\n\n \"Galley ... kitchen ... what's the difference? You two girls come with  me. I'll warrant these men are starving. I am!\" After that, things became so normal as to be almost disappointing. From  his eager reading of such magazines as Martian Tales and Cosmic  Fiction Weekly , Bobby had conceived void-travel to be one long,  momentous chain of adventure. A super-thrilling serial, punctuated by  interludes with space-pirates, narrow brushes with meteors, sabotage,  treachery\u2014hair-raising, heroic and horrifying.\n\n\n There was nothing like that to disturb the calm and peaceful journey of  the Cuchulainn . Oh, it was enjoyable to stare through the observation  panes at the flame-dotted pall of space\u2014until Pop tried to turn his  curious interest into educational channels; it was exciting, too, to  probe through the corridored recesses of their floating home\u2014except  that Dick issued strict orders that nothing must be touched, that he  must not enter certain chambers, that he mustn't push his nose into  things that didn't concern kids\u2014\n\n\n Which offended Bobby, who was sixteen, or, anyway, fifteen and  three-quarters.\n\n\n So they ate and they slept and they ate again. And Pop and Dick spelled  each other at the control banks. Moira spent endless hours with comb  and mirror, devising elaborate hair-dos which\u2014Bobby reminded her  with impudent shrewdness\u2014were so much wasted energy, since they were  settling in a place where nobody could see them. And Mom bustled about  in the galley, performing miracles with flour and stuff, and in the  recreation room, Eleanor minded The Pooch, and lost innumerable games  of cribbage to Grampaw Moseley who cheated outrageously and groused,  between hands, about the dad-blame nonsensical way Dick was handling  the ship.\n\n\n And somehow three Earth days sped by, and they were nearing their  destination. The tiny planetoid, Eros.\n\n\n Pop said, \"You deserve a great deal of credit, son, for your fine work  in rehabilitating the Cuchulainn . It has performed beautifully. You  are a good spaceman.\"\n\n\n Dick flushed. \"She's a good ship, Pop, even if she is thirty years old.  Some of these old, hand-fashioned jobs are better than the flash junk  they're turning off the belts nowadays. You've checked the declension  and trajectory?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We should come within landing radius in just a few hours. Cut  drives at 19.04.22 precisely and make such minor course alterations as  are necessary, set brakes.\" Pop smiled happily. \"We're very fortunate,  son. A mere fifteen million miles. It's not often Eros is so near  Earth.\"\n\n\n \"Don't I know it? It's almost a hundred million at perihelion. But  that's not the lucky part. You sure had to pull strings to get the  government land grant to Eros. What a plum! Atmosphere ... water ...  vegetable life ... all on a hunk of dirt fifty-seven miles in diameter.  Frankly, I don't get it! Eros must have terrific mass to have the  attributes of a full-sized planet.\"\n\n\n \"It does, Richard. A neutronium core.\"\n\n\n \"Neutronium!\" Dick gasped. \"Why don't people tell me these things?  Roaring craters, Pop, we're rich! Bloated plutocrats!\"\n\n\n \"Not so fast, son. Eventually, perhaps; not today. First we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work. After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. What's that?\"\n\n\n Bobby jumped. It was Mom's voice. But her cry was not one of fear, it  was one of excitement.\n\n\n \"Rob, look! Off to the\u2014the left, or the port, or whatever you call it!  Is that our new home?\"\n\n\n Bobby did not need to hear Pop's reply to know that it was. His swift  intake of breath was enough, the shine in his eyes as he peered out the  observation port.\n\n\n \"Eros!\" he said.\n\n\n It looked all right to Bobby. A nice, clean little sphere, spinning  lazily before their eyes like a top someone had set in motion, then  gone away and forgotten. Silver and green and rusty brown, all still  faintly blued by distance. The warm rays of old Sol reflected gaily,  giddily, from seas that covered half the planetoid's surface, and  mountains cut long, jagged shadows into sheltered plains beneath them.  It was, thought Bobby, not a bad looking little place. But not anything  to get all dewy-eyed about, like Pop was.\n\n\n Dick said softly, \"All right, Pop. Let's check and get ready to set 'er  down....\" II\n\n\n It was not Dick's fault. It was just a tough break that no one had  expected, planned for, guarded against. The planetoid was there beneath  them; they would land on it. It was as simple at that.\n\n\n Only it wasn't. Nor did they have any warning that the problem was more  complex until it was too late to change their plans, too late to halt  the irrevocable movements of a grounding spaceship. Dick should have  known, of course. He was a spaceman; he had served two tricks on the  Earth-Venus-Mars run. But all those planets were large; Eros was just a  mote. A spinning top....\n\n\n Anyway, it was after the final coordinates had been plotted, the last  bank control unchangeably set, the rockets cut, that they saw the  curved knife-edge of black slicing up over Eros' rim. For a long moment  Dick stared at it, a look of angry chagrin in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Well, blast me for an Earth-lubbing idiot! Do you see that, Pop?\"\n\n\n Pop looked like he had shared Dick's persimmon.\n\n\n \"The night-line. We forgot to consider the diurnal revolution.\"\n\n\n \"And now we've got to land in the dark. On strange terrain. Arragh! I  should have my head examined. I've got a plugged tube somewhere!\"\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley hobbled in, appraised the situation with his  incomparable ability to detect something amiss. He snorted and rattled  his cane on the floor.\n\n\n \"They's absolutely nothin',\" he informed the walls, \"to this  hereditation stuff. Elst why should my own son an' his son be so  dag-nabbed stoopid?\"\n\n\n \"'What can't be cured,'\" said Pop mildly, \"'must be endured.' We have  the forward search-beams, son. They will help.\"\n\n\n That was sheer optimism. As they neared the planet its gravitational  attraction seized them tighter and tighter until they were completely  under its compulsion. Dusk swept down upon them, the sunlight dulled,  faded, grayed. Then as the ship nosed downward, suddenly all was black.  The yellow beam of the search stabbed reluctant shadows, bringing rocky  crags and rounded tors into swift, terrifying relief.\n\n\n Dick snapped, \"Into your hammocks, everyone! Don't worry. This crate  will stand a lot of bust-up. It's tough. A little bit of luck\u2014\"\n\n\n But there was perspiration on his forehead, and his fingers played over  the control banks like frightened moths.\n\n\n There was no further need for the artificial gravs. Eros exerted,  strangely, incredibly, an attractive power almost as potent as Earth's.  Dick cut off the gravs, then the hypos. As the last machine-created  sound died away from the cabin, Bobby heard the high scream of  atmosphere, raging and tearing at the Cuchulainn with angry fingers.\n\n\n Through howling Bedlam they tumbled dizzily and for moments that were  ages long. While Dick labored frantically at the controls, while Moira  watched with bated breath. Mom said nothing, but her hand sought  Pop's; Eleanor cradled The Pooch closer to her. Grampaw scowled.\n\n\n And then, suddenly\u2014\n\n\n \"Hold tight! We're grounding!\" cried Dick.\n\n\n And instinctively Bobby braced himself for a shock. But there was  only a shuddering jar, a lessening of the roar that beat upon their  eardrums, a dull, flat thud. A sodden, heavy grinding and the groan of  metal forward. Then a false nausea momentarily assailed him. Because  for the first time in days the Cuchulainn was completely motionless.\n\n\n Dick grinned shakily. \"Well!\" he said. \"Well!\"\n\n\n Pop unbuckled his safety belt, climbed gingerly out of his hammock,  moved to the port, slid back its lock-plate. Bobby said, \"Can you see  anything, Pop? Can you?\" And Mom, who could read Pop's expressions like  a book, said, \"What is it, Rob?\"\n\n\n Pop stroked his chin. He said, \"Well, we've landed safely, Richard. But  I'm afraid we've\u2014er\u2014selected a wet landing field. We seem to be under  water!\"\n\n\n His hazard was verified immediately. Indisputably. For from the crack  beneath the door leading from the control turret to the prow-chambers  of the ship, came a dark trickle that spread and puddled and stained  and gurgled. Water!\n\n\n Dick cried, \"Hey, this is bad! We'd better get out of here\u2014\" He leaped to his controls. Once more the plaintive hum of the  hypatomics droned through the cabin, gears ground and clashed as the  motors caught, something forward exploded dully, distantly. The ship  rocked and trembled, but did not move. Again Dick tried to jet the  fore-rockets. Again, and yet again.\n\n\n And on the fourth essay, there ran through the ship a violent shudder,  broken metal grated shrilly from forward, and the water began bubbling  and churning through the crack. Deeper and swifter. Dick cut motors and  turned, his face an angry mask.\n\n\n \"We can't get loose. The entire nose must be stove in! We're leaking  like a sieve. Look, everybody\u2014get into your bulgers. We'll get out  through the airlock!\"\n\n\n Mom cried, \"But\u2014but our supplies, Dick! What are we going to do for  food, clothing, furniture\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"We'll worry about that later. Right now we've got to think of  ourselves. That-aboy, Bobby! Thanks for getting 'em out. You girls  remember how to climb into 'em? Eleanor\u2014you take that oversized one.  That's right. There's room for you and The Pooch\u2014\"\n\n\n The water was almost ankle deep in the control room by the time they  had all donned spacesuits. Bloated figures in fabricoid bulgers,  they followed Dick to the airlock. It was weird, and a little bit  frightening, but to Bobby it was thrilling, too. This was the sort of  thing you read stories about. Escape from a flooding ship....\n\n\n They had time\u2014or took time\u2014to gather together a few precious  belongings. Eleanor packed a carrier with baby food for The Pooch,  Mom a bundle of provisions hastily swept from the galley bins; Pop  remembered the medical kit and the tool-box, Grampaw was laden down  with blankets and clothing, Dick burdened himself and Bobby with  armloads of such things as he saw and forevisioned need for.\n\n\n At the lock, Dick issued final instructions.\n\n\n \"The air in the bulgers will carry you right to the surface. We'll  gather there, count noses, and decide on our next move. Pop, you go  first to lead the way, then Mom, and Eleanor, Grampaw\u2014\"\n\n\n Thus, from the heart of the doomed Cuchulainn , they fled. The  airlock was small. There was room for but one at a time. The water  was waist\u2014no, breast-deep\u2014by the time all were gone save Bobby and  Dick. Bobby, whose imagination had already assigned him the command of  the foundering ship, wanted to uphold the ancient traditions by being  the last to leave. But Dick had other ideas. He shoved Bobby\u2014not too  gently\u2014into the lock. Then there was water, black, solid, forbidding,  about him. And the outer door opening.\n\n\n He stepped forward. And floated upward, feeling an uneasy, quibbly  feeling in his stomach. Almost immediately a hard something clanged! against his impervite helmet; it was a lead-soled bulger boot; then he  was bobbing and tossing on shallow black wavelets beside the others.\n\n\n Above him was a blue-black, star-gemmed sky; off to his right, not  distant, was a rising smudge that must be the mainland. A dark blob  popped out of the water. Dick. Moira reached for the twisted branch. Dick's voice was metallic through the audios of the space-helmet. \"All  here, Pop? Everybody all right? Swell! Let's strike out for the shore,  there. Stick together, now. It isn't far.\"\n\n\n Pop said, \"The ship, Richard?\"\n\n\n \"We'll find it again. I floated up a marking buoy. That round thing  over there isn't Grampaw.\"\n\n\n Grampaw's voice was raucous, belligerent. \"You bet y'r boots it ain't!  I'm on my way to terry firmy. The last one ashore's a sissy!\"\n\n\n Swimming in a bulger, Bobby found, was silly. Like paddling a big,  warm, safe rubber rowboat. The stars winked at him, the soft waves  explored his face-plate with curious, white fingers of spray. Pretty  soon there was sand scraping his boots ... a long, smooth beach with  rolling hills beyond. In the sudden scarlet of dawn, it was impossible to believe the night  had even been frightening. Throughout the night, the Moseley clan  huddled together there on the beach, waiting, silent, wondering. But  when the sun burst over the horizon like a clamoring, brazen gong, they  looked upon this land which was their new home\u2014and found it good.\n\n\n The night did not last long. But Pop had told them it would not.\n\n\n \"Eros rotates on its axis,\" he explained, \"in about ten hours, forty  minutes, Earth time measurement. Therefore we shall have 'days' and  'nights' of five hours; short dawns or twilights. This will vary  somewhat, you understand, with the change of seasons.\"\n\n\n Dick asked, \"Isn't that a remarkably slow rotation? For such a tiny  planet, I mean? After all, Eros is only one hundred and eighty odd  miles in circumference\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Eros has many peculiarities. Some of them we have discussed before. It  approaches Earth nearer than any other celestial body, excepting Luna  and an occasional meteor or comet. When first discovered by Witt, in  1898, the world of science marveled at finding a true planetoid with  such an uncommon orbit. At perihelion it comes far within the orbit of  Mars; at aphelion it is far outside.\n\n\n \"During its near approach in 1900-01, Eros was seen to vary in  brightness at intervals of five hours and fifteen or twenty minutes.  At that time, a few of the more imaginative astronomers offered the  suggestion that this variation might be caused by diurnal rotation.  After 1931, though, the planetoid fled from Earth. It was not until  1975, the period of its next approach, that the Ronaldson-Chenwith  expedition visited it and determined the old presumption to be correct.\"\n\n\n \"We're not the first men to visit Eros, then?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. It was investigated early in the days of spaceflight.  Two research foundations, the Royal Cosmographic Society and the  Interplanetary Service, sent expeditions here. During the Black  Douglass period of terrorism, the S.S.P. set up a brief military  occupation. The Galactic Metals Corporation at one time attempted  to establish mining operations here, but the Bureau refused them  permission, for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune  that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law.\n\n\n \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As long as I can  remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own. Long years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement. As you  have said, Richard, it necessitated the pulling of many strings. Eros  is a wealthy little planet; the man who earns it wins a rich prize.  More than that, though\u2014\" Pop lifted his face to the skies, now blue  with hazy morning. There was something terribly bright and proud in his  eyes. \"More than that, there is the desire to carve a home out of the  wilderness. To be able to one day say, 'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.' Do you know what I mean, son?  In this workaday world of ours there are no more Earthly frontiers for  us to dare, as did our forefathers. But still within us all stirs the  deep, instinctive longing to hew a new home from virgin land\u2014\"\n\n\n His words dwindled into silence, and, inexplicably, Bobby felt awed.  It was Grampaw Moseley who burst the queer moment into a thousand  spluttering fragments.\n\n\n \"Talkin' about hewin',\" he said, \"S'posen we 'hew us a few vittles?  Hey?\"\n\n\n Dick roused himself.\n\n\n \"Right you are, Grampaw,\" he said. \"You can remove your bulgars. I've  tested the air; it's fine and warm, just as the report said. Moira,  while Mom and Eleanor are fixing breakfast, suppose you lay out our  blankets and spare clothing to dry? Grampaw, get a fire going. Pop and  Bobby and I will get some wood.\"\n\n\n Thus Eros greeted its new masters, and the Moseleys faced morning in  their new Eden. III\n\n\n Grampaw Moseley wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. There were  no napkins, which suited him fine.\n\n\n \"It warn't,\" he said, \"a bad meal. But it warn't a fust-class un,  neither. Them synthos an' concentrates ain't got no more flavor than\u2014\"\n\n\n Bobby agreed with him. Syntho ham wasn't too bad. It had a nice, meaty  taste. And syntho coffee tasted pretty much like the real thing. But  those syntho eggs tasted like nothing under the sun except just plain,  awful syntho eggs.\n\n\n Four Eros days\u2014the equivalent of forty-two Earth hours or so\u2014had  passed since their crash landing. In that short time, much had been  done to make their beach camp-site comfortable. All members of the  family were waiting now for Dick to return.\n\n\n Pop said seriously, \"I'm afraid you'll have to eat them and like them  for a little while, Father. We can't get fresh foods until we're  settled; we can't settle until\u2014Ah! Here comes Dick!\"\n\n\n \"I'll eat 'em,\" grumbled Grampaw, \"but be durned if I'll like 'em.  What'd you l'arn, Dicky-boy?\"\n\n\n Dick removed his helmet, unzipped himself from his bulger, shook his  head.\n\n\n \"It looks worse every time I go back. I may not be able to get in the  airlock again if the ship keeps on settling. The whole prow split wide  open when we hit, the ship is full of water. The flour and sugar and  things like that are ruined. I managed to get a few more things out,  though. Some tools, guns, wire\u2014stuff like that.\"\n\n\n \"How about the hypatomic?\"\n\n\n \"Let him eat, Rob,\" said Mom. \"He's hungry.\"\n\n\n \"I can eat and talk at the same time, Mom. I think I can get the  hypatomic out. I'd better, anyhow. If we're ever going to raise the  ship, we'll need power. And atomic power is the only kind we can get in  this wilderness.\" And he shook his head. \"But we can't do it in a day  or a week. It will take time.\"\n\n\n \"Time,\" said Pop easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are  over-supplied.\" He thought for a minute. \"If that's the way it is, we  might as well move.\"\n\n\n \"Move?\" demanded Grampaw. \"What's the matter with the place we're at?\"\n\n\n \"For one thing, it's too exposed. An open beach is no place for a  permanent habitation. So far we've been very lucky. We've had no  storms. But for a permanent camp-site, we must select a spot further  inland. A fertile place, where we can start crops. A place with fresh,  running water, natural shelter against cold and wind and rain\u2014\"\n\n\n \"What'll we do?\" grinned Dick. \"Flip a coin?\"\n\n\n \"No. Happily, there is a spot like that within an easy walk of here.  I discovered it yesterday while studying the terrain.\" Pop took a  stick, scratched a rude drawing on the sand before him. \"This is the  coastline. We landed on the west coast of this inlet. The land we see  across there, that low, flat land, I judge to be delta islands. Due  south of us is a fine, fresh-water river, watering fertile valleys to  either side. There, I think, we should build.\"\n\n\n Dick nodded.\n\n\n \"Fish from the sea, vegetables from our own farm\u2014is there any game,  Pop?\"\n\n\n \"That I don't know. We haven't seen any. Yet.\"\n\n\n \"We'll find out. Will this place you speak of be close enough to let me  continue working on the Cuchulainn ? Yes? Well, that's that. When do  we start?\"\n\n\n \"Why not now? There's nothing to keep us here.\" They packed their meager belongings while Dick finished his meal; the  sun was high when they left the beach. They followed the shore line  southward, the ground rising steadily before them. And before evening,  they came to a rolling vale through which a sparkling river meandered  lazily to the sea.\n\n\n Small wonders unfolded before their eyes. Marching along, they  had discovered that there was game on Eros. Not quite Earthly, of  course\u2014but that was not to be expected. There was one small, furry  beast about the size of a rabbit, only its color was vivid leaf-green.  Once, as they passed a wooded glen, a pale, fawnlike creature stole  from the glade, watched them with soft, curious eyes. Another time  they all started violently as the familiar siren of a Patrol monitor  screamed raucously from above them; they looked up to see an irate,  orange and jade-green bird glaring down at them.\n\n\n And of course there were insects\u2014\n\n\n \"There would have to be insects,\" Pop said. \"There could be no fruitful  vegetable life without insects. Plants need bees and crawling ants\u2014or  their equivalent\u2014to carry the pollen from one flower to another.\"\n\n\n They chose a site on the riverside, a half mile or so from, above,  and overlooking the sea. They selected it because a spring of pure,  bubbling water was nearby, because the woodlands dwindled away into  lush fields. And Pop said,\n\n\n \"This is it. We'll build our home on yonder knoll. And who knows\u2014\"  Again there grew that strange look in his eyes. \"Who knows but that  it may be the shoot from which, a time hence, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That's it, Pop!\" said Dick suddenly. \"There's the name for our  settlement. Delta Port!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Pop's ultimate vision for Eros?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"A small settlement where his family can thrive.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A big, growing city by the river.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"A big, growing city by the river.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Argument \n\nPosition: Pop\u2019s ultimate vision for Eros is to found \u201ca big, growing city by the river,\u201d not merely a small family homestead.\n\nI. Direct Evidence of an Expanding Settlement  \n1. Pop invokes the language of frontier-city building, not mere homesteading:  \n   \u2022 <quote>'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.'</quote> (I) implies a model for others to follow, not isolation.  \n   \u2022 <quote>, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n</quote> (II)  \n     \u2013 \u201cmany cabins\u2026finer homes\u2026mansions\u2026great, brave city\u201d is a clear, step-by-step plan for growth.  \n   \u2022 He names the settlement \u201cDelta Port\u201d (III), using the term \u201cport\u201d to invite traffic, trade, and further immigration.\n\n2. Land-Grant Law Requires Colonization, Not Private Retreat  \n   \u2022 <quote>of '08, it was agreed by the Triune that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law. \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As</quote> (I)  \n   \u2013 Land grants historically mandate public improvement and settlement expansion.  \n   \u2022 Pop spent years \u201cpulling strings\u201d to secure the \u201cplum\u201d of Eros (I); no one endures such bureaucratic struggle for a mere family cabin.\n\n3. Economic Vision of Mining and Agriculture  \n   \u2022 Anticipates mining once claims are secure: \u201cAfter that\u2026we might be able to consider a mining operation.\u201d (I)  \n   \u2013 Mining implies large-scale industry and labor beyond a single family.  \n   \u2022 Chooses fertile river delta site (III) with view to \u201cstart crops,\u201d fish, and exploit resources. Family alone cannot justify the location\u2019s long-term value.\n\n4. Reference to Earthly Precedent of City-Building Frontiers  \n   \u2022 Pop explicitly parallels \u201cour forefathers\u201d hewing \u201ca new home from virgin land,\u201d which historically refers to pioneering towns growing into cities (I).  \n   \u2022 His pride and \u201cbright and proud\u201d expressions (I) connote a grand endeavor, not modest isolation.\n\nII. Refutation of \u201cSmall Settlement\u201d Thesis  \n1. Misreads Temporary Necessity as Ultimate Goal  \n   \u2022 Debater_A cites beach camp and rudimentary huts as evidence of modesty, but these are emergency measures until the colony is established (II, III).  \n   \u2022 Pop\u2019s frequent statements about improving and moving inland (II) show ambition beyond the beach.\n\n2. Ignoring Pop\u2019s Emphasis on Society and Legal Claim  \n   \u2022 A \u201cland-grant settler\u201d (I) is distinct from a private squatter. The text emphasizes \u201cjustify our right to own Eros\u201d (I). Small, private use wouldn\u2019t justify such effort or legal interest.  \n   \u2022 He celebrates Eros\u2019 \u201cwealth\u201d (I) as a \u201crich prize\u201d for the man who \u201cearns it,\u201d implying exploitation for profit at scale.\n\n3. Inconsistency with Resource Needs  \n   \u2022 Pop worries about supplies, drives to retrieve more tools, hypatomic power, and provisions from the sunk ship (II, III). A few family members cannot maintain atomic machinery or mining operations, but a larger community could.  \n   \u2022 The protracted effort to raise and repair the Cuchulainn (III) shows they expect further space traffic and transport, implying import/export with other settlers.\n\nIII. Logical and Historical Parallels  \n1. Space Colonization Narratives  \n   \u2022 In numerous frontier narratives, land grants spur streams of settlers, towns, cities, and commerce. Pop\u2019s vision aligns with these tropes.  \n2. Human Instinct for Community  \n   \u2022 Pop values \u201cdays and nights,\u201d \u201cseasons,\u201d \u201ccrops,\u201d and \u201cbeauty\u201d to be \u201cmolded.\u201d Such cultural aspirations thrive in societies, not in solitary family units.\n\nConclusion  \nPop\u2019s meticulous references to \u201cmany cabins,\u201d \u201cfiner homes,\u201d \u201cmanning a port,\u201d reference to mining, and usage of \u201cland-grant\u201d language all point to his ultimate goal: to found and build a thriving, expanding city\u2014Delta Port\u2014on Eros. The small family homestead is a starting point for the grand civic vision, not the terminus.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary (Debater_A): Pop\u2019s stated aims, circumstances, and expenditures of \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cenergy\u201d all point to his personal land-grant dream of founding and sustaining a self-sufficient family settlement on Eros\u2014not immediate city-building or mass colonization. The later mention of \u201ccity\u201d by Dick is wishful extrapolation, not Pop\u2019s explicit vision.\n\n1. Pop\u2019s Constant Emphasis on \u201cLand-Grant\u201d and \u201cMy Home\u201d  \n\u2022 Claim: Pop repeatedly stresses \u201cland-grant\u201d law and the reward for himself; his \u201cdream\u201d is personal.  \n  \u2013 \u201cAs long as I can remember, it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very own\u201d <invalid_quote>(II, p. 14)</invalid_quote>.

This intimate, singular language implies a personal farmstead rather than a metropolis.  \n\u2022 Objection to Debater_B: Debater_B\u2019s \u201cbig city\u201d interpretation hinges on imagination, not Pop\u2019s words. He never specifies expanding beyond a small claim; \u201cland-grant\u201d expeditions are typically limited in population and resources (compare <quote>Spacecode of '08</quote> restrictions).\n\n2. Practical Constraints Demand a Small Settlement First  \n\u2022 Claim: The Moseleys lack resources, technology, and manpower to build a metropolis.  \n  \u2013 Crash-landing on a tiny planetoid, only their family of six, with wrecked ship and scant supplies, must first secure food, fresh water, shelter (<invalid_quote>\u201cmove inland \u2026 build \u2026 start crops\u201d</invalid_quote> (III, p. 24)).

A \u201ccity\u201d is a far-distant objective.\n\n3. \u201cShoot\u201d Metaphor Is Botanical, Not Population Forecast  \n\u2022 Claim: Pop\u2019s reference to a \u201cshoot\u201d is botanical, evoking pioneer planting, not immediate large-scale colonization.  \n  \u2013 \u201cWho knows\u2014but that it may be the shoot from which \u2026 there may spring many cabins \u2026 until at last there is a great, brave city\u201d <invalid_quote>(III, p. 26)</invalid_quote>.

Tradition of Frontier Settlement Favors Small Family Colonies  \n\u2022 Historical Context: On early Earth, initial land-grant settlements began as small farms; only after they succeeded did cities grow. Pop follows this model.  \n\u2022 Objection to Debater_B: Debater_B cannot ignore that Pop\u2019s immediate concern throughout is self-preservation, sustenance, raising crops, securing shelter, and repairing the ship: classic pioneer homesteading.\n\nConclusion: All explicit statements by Pop, pragmatic activities of the party, and the contingent, tentative language about a possible city in the distant future demonstrate that Pop\u2019s ultimate vision is to found and sustain a small, self-sufficient family settlement on Eros. The \u201ccity\u201d is merely a long-term \u201cmay\u201d\u2014not his direct goal or \u201cultimate\u201d vision.

Direct Evidence of an Expanding Settlement  \n1. Pop invokes the language of frontier-city building, not mere homesteading:  \n   \u2022 <quote>'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.'</quote> (I) implies a model for others to follow, not isolation.  \n   \u2022 <quote>, there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"\n</quote> (II)  \n     \u2013 \u201cmany cabins\u2026finer homes\u2026mansions\u2026great, brave city\u201d is a clear, step-by-step plan for growth.  \n   \u2022 He names the settlement \u201cDelta Port\u201d (III), using the term \u201cport\u201d to invite traffic, trade, and further immigration.\n\n2. Land-Grant Law Requires Colonization, Not Private Retreat  \n   \u2022 <quote>of '08, it was agreed by the Triune that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law. \"That is why,\" concluded Pop, \"we are here now. As</quote> (I)  \n   \u2013 Land grants historically mandate public improvement and settlement expansion.  \n   \u2022 Pop spent years \u201cpulling strings\u201d to secure the \u201cplum\u201d of Eros (I); no one endures such bureaucratic struggle for a mere family cabin.\n\n3. Economic Vision of Mining and Agriculture  \n   \u2022 Anticipates mining once claims are secure: \u201cAfter that\u2026we might be able to consider a mining operation.\u201d (I)  \n   \u2013 Mining implies large-scale industry and labor beyond a single family.  \n   \u2022 Chooses fertile river delta site (III) with view to \u201cstart crops,\u201d fish, and exploit resources. Family alone cannot justify the location\u2019s long-term value.\n\n4. Reference to Earthly Precedent of City-Building Frontiers  \n   \u2022 Pop explicitly parallels \u201cour forefathers\u201d hewing \u201ca new home from virgin land,\u201d which historically refers to pioneering towns growing into cities (I).  \n   \u2022 His pride and \u201cbright and proud\u201d expressions (I) connote a grand endeavor, not modest isolation.\n\nII. Refutation of \u201cSmall Settlement\u201d Thesis  \n1. Misreads Temporary Necessity as Ultimate Goal  \n   \u2022 Debater_A cites beach camp and rudimentary huts as evidence of modesty, but these are emergency measures until the colony is established (II, III).  \n   \u2022 Pop\u2019s frequent statements about improving and moving inland (II) show ambition beyond the beach.\n\n2. Ignoring Pop\u2019s Emphasis on Society and Legal Claim  \n   \u2022 A \u201cland-grant settler\u201d (I) is distinct from a private squatter. The text emphasizes \u201cjustify our right to own Eros\u201d (I). Small, private use wouldn\u2019t justify such effort or legal interest.  \n   \u2022 He celebrates Eros\u2019 \u201cwealth\u201d (I) as a \u201crich prize\u201d for the man who \u201cearns it,\u201d implying exploitation for profit at scale.\n\n3. Inconsistency with Resource Needs  \n   \u2022 Pop worries about supplies, drives to retrieve more tools, hypatomic power, and provisions from the sunk ship (II, III). A few family members cannot maintain atomic machinery or mining operations, but a larger community could.  \n   \u2022 The protracted effort to raise and repair the Cuchulainn (III) shows they expect further space traffic and transport, implying import/export with other settlers.\n\nIII. Logical and Historical Parallels  \n1. Space Colonization Narratives  \n   \u2022 In numerous frontier narratives, land grants spur streams of settlers, towns, cities, and commerce. Pop\u2019s vision aligns with these tropes.  \n2. Human Instinct for Community  \n   \u2022 Pop values \u201cdays and nights,\u201d \u201cseasons,\u201d \u201ccrops,\u201d and \u201cbeauty\u201d to be \u201cmolded.\u201d Such cultural aspirations thrive in societies, not in solitary family units.\n\nConclusion  \nPop\u2019s meticulous references to \u201cmany cabins,\u201d \u201cfiner homes,\u201d \u201cmanning a port,\u201d reference to mining, and usage of \u201cland-grant\u201d language all point to his ultimate goal: to found and build a thriving, expanding city\u2014Delta Port\u2014on Eros. The small family homestead is a starting point for the grand civic vision, not the terminus.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position and Definitions  \n   \u2022 I argue Pop\u2019s \u201cultimate vision\u201d is a self-sufficient family homestead on Eros, not immediate mass colonization. The tall-city scenario is speculative and conditional\u2014Pop\u2019s expressed goals and language make clear that initial, limited settlement is his true aim.\n\n2. \u201cLand-Grant\u201d Means Individual Claim, Not Automatic Mass Settlement  \n   \u2022 <quote> it has been my dream to take a land-grant colony for my very  own.</quote> (II, p. 14). Pop emphasizes \u201cfor my very own,\u201d indicating personal stewardship rather than a public town.  \n   \u2022 <quote> we must  establish our claims, justify our right to own Eros. That means work,  plenty of hard work.</quote> (I, p. 11). This focus on \u201cjustifying our right\u201d streamlines to fulfilling legal criteria of occupancy\u2014not promoting immigration. Once they meet requirements, the land-grant is theirs. No mention of further applicants.\n\n3. Practical Constraints Demand Small-Scale Home First  \n   \u2022 Supplies are ruined, ship is flooded, family of six alone.  \n       \u2013 \u201cThe flour and sugar and things \u2026 ruined. \u2026 I can get the hypatomic out \u2026 in this wilderness\u201d (II, p. 20). They must repair and subsist before expansion.  \n   \u2022 \u201cTime is the one commodity with which we are over-supplied\u201d (II, p. 15). He accepts a long pioneer phase. No resources for city infrastructure or settlers. Only after they self-propagate and attract traffic \u201cmay\u201d the city \u201cspring.\u201d\n\n4. \u201cShoot\u201d Metaphor Is Tentative, Long-Term Speculation  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cWho knows \u2026 there may spring many cabins \u2026 until at last \u2026 a great, brave city\u201d</invalid_quote> (III, p. 26). Note hedging words: \u201cwho knows,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cat last.\u201d Such language expresses remote possibility, not \u201cultimate vision.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Objection to B: Debater_B turns conditional future into present goal, ignoring that \u201cat last\u201d implies distant culmination. Pop\u2019s repeated \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cwill\u201d are reserved for establishing his own claim and crops, not for mass settlement.\n\n5. \u201cDelta Port\u201d is a Strategic Name for Family Logistics  \n   \u2022 \u201cPort\u201d denotes supply landing, essential to family: \u201cIt approaches Earth \u2026 solar space patrol \u2026 settling \u2026 after that, mining\u201d (I, p. 9\u201311). Pop anticipates sporadic supply runs. A port term facilitates planned resupply, not tourist traffic.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s claim that Pop \u201cpulled strings\u201d for a \u201cplum\u201d ignores that competition is fierce. He needed legal security for his own project. Every step they take\u2014moving inland, building cabins, raising crops\u2014is undertaken by the family alone (III, pp. 24\u201326). No mention of seeking settlers.\n\n6. Historical and Logical Precedent of Homestead Model  \n   \u2022 Early frontiers: individual land-grants began as single farms; only after multi-generation success did towns emerge. Pop explicitly parallels this with agricultural start: \u201cstart crops,\u201d \u201cfish,\u201d \u201cforest\u201d (III, p. 25). These are homesteading tasks.  \n   \u2022 Family\u2019s solo efforts to salvage atomic power and tools from ship demonstrate expectation of self-reliance, not industrial mining or mass immigration (II, p. 20).\n\n7. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s Specific Points  \n   A. Mining and Industry  \n       \u2013 B overstates \u201cwe might be able to consider a mining operation\u201d (I, p. 11). \u201cMight\u201d underscores uncertainty and distant possibility. Without stable base, mining is untenable.  \n   B. \u201cSociety\u201d and Legal Justification  \n       \u2013 Land-grant compliance is satisfied by family occupancy and improvements. Pop never references public welfare or immediate governance beyond his group.  \n   C. \u201cPort\u201d and Trade  \n       \u2013 Port for resupply. Everywhere they think of \u201cretriev[ing] marking buoy\u201d (II, p. 23) and repairing the Cuchulainn to return or receive supplies, typical of isolated outpost.  \n   D. \u201cPulling strings\u201d motivation  \n       \u2013 A man of means pursues distant frontier not as an excursion but to claim personal legacy. His repeated pride in \u201cmy home\u201d indicates ownership, not overlordship.\n\n8. Judge-Focused Summary  \n   \u2022 Pop\u2019s language: personal pronouns (\u201cmy,\u201d \u201cfor my own\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Actions: agriculture, self-help, repairs by family only.  \n   \u2022 Hedged future city talk: remote, conditional.  \n   \u2022 No active recruitment, legal references satisfied by family.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll explicit statements, pragmatic activities, and cautious conditional language demonstrate Pop\u2019s true ambition is to pioneer a small settlement\u2014his personal homestead and family colony\u2014on Eros. The conjectured city is a remote, uncertain possibility contingent on their success and future immigration, not Pop\u2019s immediate \u201cultimate vision.\u201d  \n\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nOpening Statement  \nPosition: Pop\u2019s ultimate vision is to create \u201ca big, growing city by the river,\u201d not merely a solitary family homestead.\n\nI. Pop\u2019s Explicit Blueprint for Expansion  \n1. Stepwise Growth Language  \n  \u2022 <quote> there may spring many  cabins, then finer homes, and buildings, and mansions, until at last  there is a great, brave city here on this port by the delta\u2014\"</quote> (III)  \n    \u2013 This is not botanical hedging alone; he specifies each phase, culminating in a \u201cgreat, brave city.\u201d He uses future tense \u201cat last\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d to express process, not to deny intention.  \n  \u2022 Naming the site \u201cDelta Port\u201d (III)  \n    \u2013 \u201cPort\u201d connotes trade and influx, essential for a commercial hub. No private farm needs a \u201cport\u201d designation; land-grant law encourages shipping and immigration.\n\n2. Legal and Economic Imperative of Land-Grant Colonization  \n  \u2022 <quote>for under the Spacecode of '08, it was agreed by the Triune that all asteroids should be settled under land-grant law. \"That is why,\" concluded</quote> (I)  \n    \u2013 Land grants historically presuppose public settlement and community development, not exclusive private retreats.  \n  \u2022 Pop \u201cpulled strings\u201d to win the \u201cplum\u201d of Eros\u2019 rich resources (I)  \n    \u2013 Time and effort wasted if goal were only a small homestead. He anticipates future mining: <quote> After that, we might be able to consider a mining  operation. </quote> (I) \u2013 industry beyond family capacity.\n\n3. Preparedness for Industry and Traffic  \n  \u2022 Efforts to recover and repair the Cuchulainn (II, III)  \n    \u2013 Hypo\u00adatomics, spare tools, marking buoys, search-beams\u2014all signal ongoing space traffic and trade. A true rancher wouldn\u2019t invest in repairing a spaceship unless expecting arrivals or departures to support a larger community.  \n  \u2022 Selection of fertile river delta site (III)  \n    \u2013 \u201cStart crops\u201d and \u201cfish from the sea\u201d initially, but river frontage allows shipping of agricultural and mineral exports to attract settlers and supply ships.\n\n4. Cultural and Psychological Motivation  \n  \u2022 Pop\u2019s reference to \u201cforefathers\u201d hewing \u201cnew home from virgin land,\u201d \u201clong years ago I decided that Eros should be my settlement.\u201d (I)  \n    \u2013 He echoes manifest-destiny rhetoric tied to city-building and nation formation. Pioneers did not dream only of isolated cabins but of civic centers growing into cities.\n\nII. Refuting the \u201cSmall Settlement\u201d Thesis  \n1. Practical Starts \u2260 Ultimate Vision  \n  \u2022 Every colonization begins with minimal resources; Debater_A conflates necessity with goal.  \n  \u2022 Pop stresses abundant \u201ctime\u201d: <quote>easily, \"is the one commodity with which we are over-supplied.\" He</quote> (III) Patiently awaits gradual expansion.\n\n2. \u201cMy home\u201d Language Includes Community Model  \n  \u2022 <quote>'Here is my home that I have  molded into beauty with my own hands.</quote> (II)  \n    \u2013 Demonstrative model intended to \u201cwin over the unscrupulous United Ores Corporation\u201d and future settlers. An exemplar trasmitted to \u201cFoundation\u201d expeditions.\n\n3. Conditional \u201cMay\u201d Indicates Contingency, Not Lack of Intent  \n  \u2022 Speculation (\u201cmay spring\u201d) is prudent in unknown environment, yet context shows Pop\u2019s unwavering ambition: he \u201cpulled strings\u201d multiple approaches (I), fought bureaucrats, and endured crash landing to realize it. He would not expend such effort absent grand vision.\n\n4. Insufficient Population Argument Rebutted by Expected Immigration  \n  \u2022 Repair of ship and anticipation of resupply: marking buoy to \u201cfind it again\u201d (III), search-beams (II). They plan to recommission Cuchulainn to ferry emigrants and equipment.  \n  \u2022 Land-grant colonies receive newcomers; Pop expects to justify title by continuous occupation, improvement, and traffic.\n\nIII. Logical and Genre Consistency  \n1. Frontier Fiction Norms  \n  \u2022 Bond\u2019s tale parallels Western and pioneering narratives where one family opens frontier, then waves of settlers follow to form towns and cities. Pop\u2019s repeated references to \u201cwealth,\u201d \u201crich prize,\u201d and city-building echo that motif.  \n2. Economic Sustainability Demands Scale  \n  \u2022 Mining of neutronium core and ore extraction require labor and capital beyond a family; only a growing settlement can attract and support the workforce and infrastructure.\n\nConclusion  \nAll concrete evidence\u2014Pop\u2019s language of \u201cmany cabins\u2026mansion\u2026great city,\u201d the naming of \u201cDelta Port,\u201d adherence to land-grant law, investment in space transport, and alignment with frontier-colonization patterns\u2014points irresistibly to an ultimate vision of an expanding city. The small homestead is merely the first step toward a thriving urban settlement on Eros.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
