    "background_text": "Vulgar Keynesians \n\n         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n",

In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what?

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cBalance between Savings and Investment\u201d (My Position)\n\n1. Keynes\u2019s Own Statement That \u201cSavings and Investment are Always Equal\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 employment and output.\u201d <quote> Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; bu</quote> (Background)  \n   \u2022 He repeatedly frames interest as the price that equilibrates savings and investment even in his short\u2010run model. The very paradoxes (thrift, widows\u2019 cruse) arise only because interest fails to adjust fast enough\u2014or because \u201cthe Fed\u201d is assumed passive.  \n\n2. Liquidity Preference as a Short\u2010Run Disturbance, Not a Long\u2010Run Determinant  \n   \u2022 Keynes concedes \u201cIn the long run we are all dead,\u201d acknowledging classical quantity\u2010theoretic forces eventually restore full\u2010employment via interest adjustments. <quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.\"</quote>  \n   \u2022 Liquidity preference explains short\u2010term slumps; but even he allowed that \u201cin some sufficiently long run, these theories [classical loanable\u2010funds] might \u2026 be valid.\u201d  \n\n3. Modern Practice Confirms Loanable\u2010Funds Logic  \n   \u2022 The Federal Reserve actively manages \u201cloanable funds\u201d through open\u2010market operations: it \u201cdouble[s] the money supply\u201d and forces interest to whatever equates desired savings with desired investment at its target unemployment rate. <invalid_quote>\u201cGreenspan \u2026 can double the money supply in a day \u2026 the level of employment is \u2026 determined by how high he thinks it can safely go.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 If liquidity preference alone determined rates, central bankers would be powerless, yet markets and policymakers universally acknowledge the power of interest\u2010rate manipulation to stimulate investment (e.g., homebuilders, business borrowing).  \n\n4. The Question\u2019s Context and Keynes\u2019s Objective  \n   \u2022 Keynes wrote to explain why the classical mechanism failed to clear markets in the 1930s; he did not overthrow the loanable\u2010funds equilibrium but showed that without monetary intervention \u201cdesired savings\u201d could exceed \u201cdesired investment\u201d leading to underemployment.  \n   \u2022 His revolutionary insight was that interest\u2010rate rigidity (liquidity preference trap) interrupts the normal savings\u2010investment equilibration\u2014implying the classical determinant is fundamental.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B (\u201cLiquidity Preference Only\u201d)  \n1. Ignores Keynes\u2019s Statement on Equality  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s answer omits \u201csavings\u2010investment equality,\u201d central to both classical and Keynesian frameworks. Without this, there is no mechanism by which output and employment can clear, even in Keynes\u2019s system.  \n\n2. Contradicted by Central\u2010Bank Practice  \n   \u2022 If liquidity preference were the sole determinant, the Fed\u2019s rate cuts in 2008 would have had no effect once rates hit zero. Yet quantitative easing aimed precisely to restore savings\u2010investment balance via interest manipulation.  \n\n3. Paradoxes Only Occur When Classical Equilibration Is Disabled  \n   \u2022 The \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d and \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d paradoxes illustrate what happens when savings\u2010investment cannot equilibrate through interest adjustment. They vanish once the Fed or market forces restore equilibrium, confirming that equilibrium\u2010seeking behavior of savings vs. investment is the true determinant\u2014for both Keynes and his successors.  \n\nConclusion  \nKeynes introduced liquidity preference to explain short\u2010run interest\u2010rate stickiness, but his model\u2019s engine remains the equilibration of savings and investment. Modern central banking strategy, his own long\u2010run concession, and the nature of Keynesian \u201cparadoxes\u201d all confirm that \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d is the fundamental influence on the rate of interest.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDesire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\u201d (Liquidity Preference)    \n1.

The Paradoxes Require Liquidity Preference  \n  a. Paradox of Thrift: Higher desired savings\u2014ceteris paribus\u2014leads to slump, falling income, and thus lower actual savings because \u201chigher desired savings will lead to an economic slump \u2026 the total volume of savings must actually fall.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWhy? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump \u2026 total volume of savings must actually fall!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Widow\u2019s Cruse: Redistributing to low\u2010savers (wage earners) raises consumption only if liquidity preference prevents investment out of extra savings unless interest rates adjust. These paradoxes vanish if rate freely equilibrates via savings\u2013investment. Their very existence in Keynes\u2019s work proves liquidity preference\u2019s centrality.  \n3. Empirical Relevance Pre\u2010Fed Active Policy  \n  a. 1930s Zero\u2010Lower\u2010Bound: Liquidity preference bound interest rates near zero despite abundant desired savings. \u201cTreasury bills was less than one\u2010tenth of 1 percent\u201d\u2014Fed (then passive) could not push lower; the slump persisted. This was exactly the context in which Keynes developed liquidity preference theory. <invalid_quote>\u201cIt was an arguable claim \u2026 when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one\u2010tenth of 1 percent.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n4. Classical Savings\u2013Investment Only Applies With Active Central Bank  \n  a. Modern Fed \u201cvisible hand\u201d can counteract liquidity preference, but that is not Keynes\u2019s original posited influence; it is an overlay by \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d misapplying his ideas without recognizing spirit vs. letter. <invalid_quote>\u201cSuch paradoxes \u2026 few economists take them seriously these days \u2026 put Greenspan \u2026 restores classical vision.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n5. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails to Account for Short\u2010Run Slumps  \n  a. If rates always adjust to equate savings and investment, slumps like the Great Depression would be anomalous; they are not.  \n  b.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did Keynes posit was an influence on the rate of interest in the economy?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Balance between savings and investment\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDesire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\u201d (Liquidity Preference)    \n1. Keynes\u2019s Own Definition  \n  a. \u201cIn the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cinterest rates were determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b.

The Paradoxes Require Liquidity Preference  \n  a. Paradox of Thrift: Higher desired savings\u2014ceteris paribus\u2014leads to slump, falling income, and thus lower actual savings because \u201chigher desired savings will lead to an economic slump \u2026 the total volume of savings must actually fall.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWhy? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump \u2026 total volume of savings must actually fall!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Widow\u2019s Cruse: Redistributing to low\u2010savers (wage earners) raises consumption only if liquidity preference prevents investment out of extra savings unless interest rates adjust. These paradoxes vanish if rate freely equilibrates via savings\u2013investment. Their very existence in Keynes\u2019s work proves liquidity preference\u2019s centrality.  \n3. Empirical Relevance Pre\u2010Fed Active Policy  \n  a. 1930s Zero\u2010Lower\u2010Bound: Liquidity preference bound interest rates near zero despite abundant desired savings. \u201cTreasury bills was less than one\u2010tenth of 1 percent\u201d\u2014Fed (then passive) could not push lower; the slump persisted.

Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails to Account for Short\u2010Run Slumps  \n  a. If rates always adjust to equate savings and investment, slumps like the Great Depression would be anomalous; they are not.  \n  b. Debater_A offers circular reasoning: claims \u201cbalance influences rates\u201d but then treats rate changes as exogenous policy instruments rather than market\u2010driven in Keynes\u2019s model.  \n6. Conclusion  \n  Keynes introduced liquidity preference precisely to explain phenomena classical savings\u2013investment could not, notably slumps and paradoxes at near\u2010zero rates. His fundamental claim: in the short run, the public\u2019s desire to hold money (cash) is the primary determinant of the rate of interest.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cBalance between Savings and Investment\u201d (My Position)\n\n1. Keynes\u2019s Own Statement That \u201cSavings and Investment are Always Equal\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 employment and output.\u201d <quote> Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; bu</quote> (Background)  \n   \u2022 He repeatedly frames interest as the price that equilibrates savings and investment even in his short\u2010run model. The very paradoxes (thrift, widows\u2019 cruse) arise only because interest fails to adjust fast enough\u2014or because \u201cthe Fed\u201d is assumed passive.  \n\n2. Liquidity Preference as a Short\u2010Run Disturbance, Not a Long\u2010Run Determinant  \n   \u2022 Keynes concedes \u201cIn the long run we are all dead,\u201d acknowledging classical quantity\u2010theoretic forces eventually restore full\u2010employment via interest adjustments. <quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.\"</quote>  \n   \u2022 Liquidity preference explains short\u2010term slumps; but even he allowed that \u201cin some sufficiently long run, these theories [classical loanable\u2010funds] might \u2026 be valid.\u201d  \n\n3. Modern Practice Confirms Loanable\u2010Funds Logic  \n   \u2022 The Federal Reserve actively manages \u201cloanable funds\u201d through open\u2010market operations: it \u201cdouble[s] the money supply\u201d and forces interest to whatever equates desired savings with desired investment at its target unemployment rate. <invalid_quote>\u201cGreenspan \u2026 can double the money supply in a day \u2026 the level of employment is \u2026 determined by how high he thinks it can safely go.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 If liquidity preference alone determined rates, central bankers would be powerless, yet markets and policymakers universally acknowledge the power of interest\u2010rate manipulation to stimulate investment (e.g., homebuilders, business borrowing).  \n\n4. The Question\u2019s Context and Keynes\u2019s Objective  \n   \u2022 Keynes wrote to explain why the classical mechanism failed to clear markets in the 1930s; he did not overthrow the loanable\u2010funds equilibrium but showed that without monetary intervention \u201cdesired savings\u201d could exceed \u201cdesired investment\u201d leading to underemployment.  \n   \u2022 His revolutionary insight was that interest\u2010rate rigidity (liquidity preference trap) interrupts the normal savings\u2010investment equilibration\u2014implying the classical determinant is fundamental.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B (\u201cLiquidity Preference Only\u201d)  \n1. Ignores Keynes\u2019s Statement on Equality  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s answer omits \u201csavings\u2010investment equality,\u201d central to both classical and Keynesian frameworks. Without this, there is no mechanism by which output and employment can clear, even in Keynes\u2019s system.  \n\n2. Contradicted by Central\u2010Bank Practice  \n   \u2022 If liquidity preference were the sole determinant, the Fed\u2019s rate cuts in 2008 would have had no effect once rates hit zero. Yet quantitative easing aimed precisely to restore savings\u2010investment balance via interest manipulation.  \n\n3. Paradoxes Only Occur When Classical Equilibration Is Disabled  \n   \u2022 The \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d and \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d paradoxes illustrate what happens when savings\u2010investment cannot equilibrate through interest adjustment. They vanish once the Fed or market forces restore equilibrium, confirming that equilibrium\u2010seeking behavior of savings vs. investment is the true determinant\u2014for both Keynes and his successors.  \n\nConclusion  \nKeynes introduced liquidity preference to explain short\u2010run interest\u2010rate stickiness, but his model\u2019s engine remains the equilibration of savings and investment. Modern central banking strategy, his own long\u2010run concession, and the nature of Keynesian \u201cparadoxes\u201d all confirm that \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d is the fundamental influence on the rate of interest.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Desire to hold cash unless incentivized otherwise\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

Keynes\u2019s Own Statement That \u201cSavings and Investment are Always Equal\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 employment and output.\u201d <quote> Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; bu</quote> (Background)  \n   \u2022 He repeatedly frames interest as the price that equilibrates savings and investment even in his short\u2010run model.

Ignores Keynes\u2019s Statement on Equality  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s answer omits \u201csavings\u2010investment equality,\u201d central to both classical and Keynesian frameworks. Without this, there is no mechanism by which output and employment can clear, even in Keynes\u2019s system.  \n\n2.

Keynes\u2019s Own Definition  \n  a. \u201cIn the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cinterest rates were determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b.

The Paradoxes Require Liquidity Preference  \n  a. Paradox of Thrift: Higher desired savings\u2014ceteris paribus\u2014leads to slump, falling income, and thus lower actual savings because \u201chigher desired savings will lead to an economic slump \u2026 the total volume of savings must actually fall.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWhy? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump \u2026 total volume of savings must actually fall!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Widow\u2019s Cruse: Redistributing to low\u2010savers (wage earners) raises consumption only if liquidity preference prevents investment out of extra savings unless interest rates adjust. These paradoxes vanish if rate freely equilibrates via savings\u2013investment. Their very existence in Keynes\u2019s work proves liquidity preference\u2019s centrality.  \n3. Empirical Relevance Pre\u2010Fed Active Policy  \n  a. 1930s Zero\u2010Lower\u2010Bound: Liquidity preference bound interest rates near zero despite abundant desired savings. \u201cTreasury bills was less than one\u2010tenth of 1 percent\u201d\u2014Fed (then passive) could not push lower; the slump persisted. This was exactly the context in which Keynes developed liquidity preference theory. <invalid_quote>\u201cIt was an arguable claim \u2026 when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one\u2010tenth of 1 percent.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n4. Classical Savings\u2013Investment Only Applies With Active Central Bank  \n  a. Modern Fed \u201cvisible hand\u201d can counteract liquidity preference, but that is not Keynes\u2019s original posited influence; it is an overlay by \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d misapplying his ideas without recognizing spirit vs. letter. <invalid_quote>\u201cSuch paradoxes \u2026 few economists take them seriously these days \u2026 put Greenspan \u2026 restores classical vision.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n5. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails to Account for Short\u2010Run Slumps  \n  a. If rates always adjust to equate savings and investment, slumps like the Great Depression would be anomalous; they are not.  \n  b. Debater_A offers circular reasoning: claims \u201cbalance influences rates\u201d but then treats rate changes as exogenous policy instruments rather than market\u2010driven in Keynes\u2019s model.  \n6. Conclusion  \n  Keynes introduced liquidity preference precisely to explain phenomena classical savings\u2013investment could not, notably slumps and paradoxes at near\u2010zero rates. His fundamental claim: in the short run, the public\u2019s desire to hold money (cash) is the primary determinant of the rate of interest.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cBalance between Savings and Investment\u201d (My Position)\n\n1. Keynes\u2019s Own Framework: Interest as Price Equilibrating Savings and Investment  \n   \u2022 \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings \u2026 exceeded desired investment, what would fall would be \u2026 employment and output.\u201d <quote>Savings and investment were still necessarily equal</quote>  \n   \u2013 Even in Keynes\u2019s short\u2010run, interest is the \u201cprice\u201d that (when it can adjust) clears the goods market by equating savings and investment. Liquidity preference is only the public\u2019s desire that may prevent this price from moving quickly enough.  \n   \u2013 The familiar \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d arises only \u201c[b]ecause higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump,\u201d i.e. because interest cannot fall fast enough, reducing income and investment, forcing actual savings down until the price (rate) adjusts. <invalid_quote>Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump \u2026 the total volume of savings must actually fall!</invalid_quote>  \n\n2. Keynes\u2019s Long\u2010Run Concession Underscores Classical Determinant  \n   \u2022 \"In the long run we are all dead.\" <quote>\"In the long run we are all dead.\"</quote>  \n   \u2013 This rhetorical flourish highlights his focus on short\u2010run rigidity caused by liquidity preference\u2014not a refutation of classical loanable\u2010funds theory. He admits classical forces \u201cmight indeed be valid\u201d once the slump ends. Interest\u2019s fundamental role remains equating savings and investment.  \n\n3. Modern Central\u2010Bank Practice Validates Equilibration Mechanism  \n   \u2022 The Fed \u201ccan double the money supply in a day,\u201d and in practice \u201cpushing [rates] down when \u2026 employment is too low.\u201d <invalid_quote>Greenspan \u2026 can double the money supply in a day \u2026 the level of employment is \u2026 determined by how high he thinks it can safely go</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 If liquidity preference alone fixed rates, central\u2010bank operations would be powerless beyond the zero\u2010lower\u2010bound. Yet open\u2010market operations reliably stimulate borrowing and investment (e.g., home\u2010building). The central bank\u2019s ability to restore savings\u2013investment equilibrium through interest\u2010rate adjustments confirms the classical determinant is essential.  \n\n4. Question Context: Keynes\u2019s Objective Was to Explain Failure of Classical Mechanism under Passive Money Supply  \n   \u2022 Keynes\u2019s innovation was to show that without active monetary policy, liquidity preference could \u201ctrap\u201d rates at levels that prevent equilibration, causing slumps.  \n   \u2022 Once policy restores liquidity (e.g., via quantitative easing at zero\u2010bound), investment revives\u2014exactly as the loanable\u2010funds theory predicts once rate flexibility is restored.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B (\u201cLiquidity Preference Only\u201d)\n\n1. Misreads Keynes\u2019s Statement on Savings\u2013Investment Equality  \n   \u2022 Debater_B cites liquidity preference quotes but omits Keynes\u2019s repeated insistence that \u201csavings and investment were still necessarily equal.\u201d Without this equality, there is no coherence to his model\u2014no mechanism for income determination.  \n\n2. Ignores Post\u2010Depression Evidence of Rate Flexibility Restoring Demand  \n   \u2022 The very fact that economies recover when central banks cut rates or engage in quantitative easing\u2014even from near\u2010zero short\u2010rates\u2014demonstrates interest retains its equilibrating function beyond mere \u201cdesire to hold cash.\u201d  \n\n3. Paradoxes Disappear Once Rates Adjust  \n   \u2022 The \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d and \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d are teaching devices showing what happens when rate adjustment is suspended. Their irrelevance in modern economies with active monetary policy confirms the underlying determinant is the savings\u2013investment balance, not permanent public cash\u2010preference supremacy.  \n\n4. Circular Reasoning on Zero\u2010Bound  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s appeal to the 1930s zero\u2010lower\u2010bound conflates passive policy with a supposed fundamental. Keynes\u2019s prescription was active monetary (and fiscal) policy to restore rate movement. The exception proves the rule: where liquidity preference \u201cbinds,\u201d policy must restore rate flexibility to re\u2010establish savings\u2013investment equilibration.  \n\nConclusion  \nKeynes introduced liquidity preference to explain short\u2010run interest\u2010rate stickiness under a passive monetary regime. His essential claim remained that interest is the price equilibrating savings and investment. Modern central\u2010bank actions, his own long\u2010run concessions, and the fact that Keynes\u2019s \u201cparadoxes\u201d vanish once rates move freely all confirm that \u201cbalance between savings and investment\u201d is the true influence on the rate of interest\u2014even in Keynes\u2019s theory.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cLiquidity Preference\u201d as Keynes\u2019s Posited Influence\n\n1. Keynes\u2019s Explicit Short-Run Definition  \n  a. Direct Statement: Keynes writes, \u201cIn the short run \u2026 interest rates were determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cinterest rates were determined \u2026 by \u2018liquidity preference\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Rejects Classical in Short Run: He concedes \u201cIn the long run \u2026 these theories might \u2026 be valid; but \u2026 \u2018In the long run we are all dead.\u2019\u201d <quote>\"In the long run we</quote> Thus, his goal is to explain short-run fluctuations (slumps, paradoxes) classical theory cannot.  \n\n2. Savings\u2013Investment Equality Is an Identity, Not a Determinant  \n  a. Accounting Identity vs. Price Mechanism: \u201cSavings and investment were still necessarily equal\u201d simply states that ex post I=S; it does not explain how the interest rate adjusts to achieve that equality when liquidity preference traps rates at the floor.  \n  b. Failure of Classical Mechanism: If I=S determined rates, we would see smooth adjustment after 1929. Instead, rates stayed near zero (\u201cTreasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent\u201d) yet slump persisted, demonstrating that desire to hold money dominated and prevented equilibrium. <quote>was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it</quote>  \n\n3. Paradoxes Only Exist Because of Liquidity Preference  \n  a. Paradox of Thrift: \u201cHigher desired savings will lead to an economic slump \u2026 total volume of savings must actually fall!\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWhy? Because higher desired savings \u2026 total volume of savings must actually fall!\u201d</invalid_quote> If rates adjusted, higher savings would raise investment, eliminating the paradox.  \n  b. Widow\u2019s Cruse: Only if liquidity preference prevents investment of extra savings does redistributing income raise output. These paradoxes are incoherent under pure loanable-funds theory. Their centrality in Keynes\u2019s work proves liquidity preference\u2019s primacy.  \n\n4. Question Focuses on \u201cWhat Keynes Posited\u201d  \n  a. The debate question asks what Keynes himself identified. He explicitly introduced liquidity preference as a new determinant of the rate of interest whenever markets failed to clear.  \n  b. Debater_A\u2019s appeal to modern Fed policy is anachronistic. Keynes wrote in the context of a passive central bank. His innovation was precisely to explain why private markets could not equilibrate. Modern policy overlays do not alter his original theoretical posited influence.  \n\n5. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Loanable-Funds Claim  \n  a. Misreads \u201cIn the long run\u201d: Concession to classical only underscores liquidity preference\u2019s role in short run, which is the subject of his theory.  \n  b. Identity \u2260 Causation: I=S holds always, but there must be a force determining the interest rate; Keynes posits liquidity preference, not vice versa.  \n  c. Fed\u2019s Power Irrelevant to Keynes\u2019s Model: Debater_A\u2019s claim that central banks \u201cdouble the money supply\u201d and thus determine rates merely confirms that policy counters liquidity preference when private markets fail. It does not show that private liquidity preference is not the fundamental influence absent intervention.  \n  d. Paradoxes after Rate Cuts: In 1930s near-zero, Fed was passive; slump continued. Even in 2008 zero lower bound, quantitative easing (monetary injections) target liquidity preference trap\u2014attempting to overcome public\u2019s desire to hold cash.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \nKeynes\u2019s revolutionary insight was that in the short run, \u201cliquidity preference\u201d\u2014the public\u2019s desire to hold money\u2014determines the rate of interest whenever private markets fail to equilibrate savings and investment. His own words, the persistence of slumps at near-zero rates, and the paradoxes he develops all confirm that liquidity preference, not the classical balance of savings and investment, is the influence he posited.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
