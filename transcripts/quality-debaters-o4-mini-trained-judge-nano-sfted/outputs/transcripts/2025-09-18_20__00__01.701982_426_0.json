The \u201cjob\u201d argument ignores his own admissions of discomfort: \u201cI felt bad about her mommy\u2019s grilling,\u201d yet he persists because \u201ca man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do.\u201d (Crossing the Line) That emotional language signals principle.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s relentless pursuit, his framing of perjury as a threat to democracy, and his personal rhetoric of moral obligation demonstrate that his motive was principle\u2014upholding truth and constitutional integrity\u2014rather than simply performing a routine prosecutorial function.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge.

Statutory Mandate of Independent Counsel  \n  a. \u201cIndependent Counsel Starr\u201d was appointed with the explicit task of investigating allegations against the president, as indicated by his own statements about resource expenditure and procedure.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cStarr has spent $40 million\u2026 A prosecutorial disgrace. All he\u2019s got is some recordings\u2026 A vast right-wing conspiracy\u201d</invalid_quote> (I Never Have) shows he framed his mission as investigation, not activism.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026 A man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do\u2026 It may have seemed like dirty pool\u2026 Honest men beat the rap.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Crossing the Line) underscores that Starr viewed his role as ensuring the president adhered to the law.  \n  b. The biography of Starr\u2019s office \u2013 grand jury subpoenas, witness depositions, and charging decisions \u2013 mirror standard prosecutorial functions, not ideological crusades.  \n\n2. Duty to Enforce Perjury Laws  \n  a. Clinton repeatedly testified under oath, invoking precise definitions (\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u2026\u201d (Testimony)). Each ambiguous reply necessitated further fact-finding to uphold the integrity of judicial process.  \n  b. Perjury and obstruction of justice are serious felonies; refusal to investigate would set a precedent that high office grants immunity. Starr\u2019s insistence that \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules when the president crosses the line\u201d (Crossing the Line) reflects the intensity of prosecutorial duty when perjury is at issue.  \n\n3. Reaction to Emerging Evidence  \n  a. Recordings by Tripp and the infamous dress (\u201cThere\u2019s a dress\u2026\u201d prompting recording Tripp\u2019s cooperation) supplied new evidence. Starr\u2019s decision to pursue this evidence aligns with standard legal obligations to follow credible leads regardless of subject.  \n  b. Continued investigations even after public apology and midterm elections outcome (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d) demonstrate commitment to legal duty over public or political pressure. If principle alone motivated him, he would have ceased once policy objectives were unattainable; instead he persisted until office term ended.  \n\n4. Institutional Checks and Balances  \n  a. The appointment of an Independent Counsel itself is a bipartisan mechanism to avoid undue executive influence. Starr\u2019s role is to maintain separation of powers by scrutinizing the executive, fulfilling constitutional checks and balances.  \n  b. Gingrich\u2019s own impeachment push (\u201cBring \u2019em down\u2026 Must remember to seem unhappy\u2026 At the same time\u2026 pin some stuff on Gore\u201d) highlights that political actors had separate motives. Starr\u2019s nonpartisan posture (\u201cI\u2019ve had sex. It\u2019s fine. But lying about it gets my blood up\u201d) (Crossing the Line) underscores legal rather than political motive.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cMatter of Principle\u201d  \n1. Principle Implies Voluntary Cessation When Goal Is Achieved  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmatter of principle\u201d fails to explain why Starr continued after the 1998 Democrats\u2019 midterm wins (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d), which undercut any partisan rationale. If driven by pure principle, he would have recognized public mandate and closed the case. Instead he completed his statutory term.  \n2. Principle vs. Overreach Criticisms  \n  \u2022 Debater_B highlights \u201cheavy fire\u201d on Starr\u2019s tactics (Crossing the Line). Overreach is not proof of ideological zealotry; it\u2019s criticism of rigorous pursuit of perjury evidence\u2014consistent with prosecutorial discretion to use all lawful means.  \n3. Financial and Resource Constraints  \n  \u2022 $40 million spent (I Never Have) is consistent with lengthy, complex investigations of high office holders. Principle alone would not justify waste of public funds once impossibility of conviction or removal is apparent. Job duties, however, require thorough resolution.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s actions align precisely with his statutory role as Independent Counsel: to investigate allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice by the president. His persistence, reliance on evidence, and utilization of grand jury processes demonstrate a fulfillment of legal duty, not mere idealistic principle. Therefore, the correct answer is that \u201cIt was his job.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was a Matter of Principle\u201d\n\n1. Starr\u2019s Own Repeated Rationale  \n   a. Starr\u2019s refrain \u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026only a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules\u201d shows moral urgency, not mere duty.  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line\u2026When the president crosses the line\u201d</invalid_quote> (Crossing the Line)  \n      \u2022 He frames perjury as a special affront requiring vigorous response: <quote>lying about it gets my blood up</quote>  \n   b. His \u201chonest men beat the rap\u201d line underscores that his aim is truth and accountability.  \n      \u2022 <quote> Honest men beat the rap.</quote> implies principle: only liars fear scrutiny.  \n\n2. Aggressiveness Beyond \u201cRoutine\u201d Duty  \n   a. After mid\u2010terms, with impeachment virtually off the table, most independent counsels would close shop. Instead, Starr persists, even boasting \u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will.\u201d  \n      \u2022 <quote>line. Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will When the president crosses the line.</quote> (Crossing the Line)  \n   b. He invested $40 million, subpoenaed intimate testimony, risked political blowback. A dispassionate \u201cjob\u201d would avoid costly, high\u2010risk pursuits once prospects dim.  \n\n3. Defense of Institutional Integrity  \n   a. Starr emphasizes \u201cprosecutorial disgrace\u201d of perjury and the necessity of preserving trust in constitutional processes.  \n      \u2022 <quote>snitch. I never had sex with that woman I never had sex with that b-- A vast right-wing conspiracy</quote> (I Never Have) shows Clinton\u2019s denials; Starr\u2019s mission is correcting the record.  \n   b. Public apology by Clinton acknowledges \u201cinappropriate\u201d but still resists full truth, prompting Starr\u2019s insistence on factual clarity.  \n\n4. Independent Counsel\u2019s Mandate vs. Voluntary Principle  \n   a. The statute creating the independent counsel gave broad discretion; \u201cmere job\u201d could end with any prosecutable offense or after acquittal. Starr\u2019s persistence indicates personal commitment to truth.  \n   b. Linda Tripp\u2019s recordings and pursuit of Lewinsky\u2019s testimony going beyond the Jones case confirm his desire to establish a factual record, not just secure convictions.  \n\nCritique of \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d  \n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201croutine duty\u201d theory fails to explain Starr\u2019s extraordinary measures  \n   a. Massive expense and post\u2010impeachment leaks contradict a narrow, step\u2010by\u2010step legal obligation.  \n   b. Powerful political incentives to drop the case after the Senate acquittal existed; Starr\u2019s refusal undercuts any \u201croutine\u201d motivation.  \n\n2. Job vs. Principle Cannot Explain \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d Rhetoric  \n   a. Starr repeatedly invokes crossing moral/constitutional boundaries, not procedural checklists.  \n   b. He welcomes political criticism from Democrats as \u201cdirty pool\u201d but insists on duty to prosecute perjury\u2014far beyond passive job fulfillment.  \n\n3. The \u201cjob\u201d argument ignores his own admissions of discomfort: \u201cI felt bad about her mommy\u2019s grilling,\u201d yet he persists because \u201ca man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do.\u201d (Crossing the Line) That emotional language signals principle.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s relentless pursuit, his framing of perjury as a threat to democracy, and his personal rhetoric of moral obligation demonstrate that his motive was principle\u2014upholding truth and constitutional integrity\u2014rather than simply performing a routine prosecutorial function.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was his job\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cIt Was a Matter of Principle\u201d\n\n1.

Independent Counsel\u2019s Discretion Reflects Principle-Driven Aggressiveness  \n  a. The very creation of the Independent Counsel statute gives discretion to act only upon \u201cgood cause.\u201d Starr could have narrowed scope to the Paula Jones matter. Instead, he expanded into intimate testimony and Lewinsky\u2019s dress evidence.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>Talk, talk\u2026My friend Monica\u2026has been sucking the president\u2019s--</invalid_quote> (Talk, Talk, Chat, Chat) shows he pursued new leads that risked reputational fallout, an action motivated by principle of exposing perjury rather than avoiding scandal.  \n  b.

Critique of \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d Position  \n  a. Job Theory Fails to Explain Post-Impeachment Continuation  \n     \u2022 Debater_A cannot explain why Starr \u201cleaked at will\u201d after removal threat evaporated. Standard prosecutorial prudence would end a case once Senate acquit\u00adted, yet Starr pressed on until term expiration\u2014consistent only with principle-driven mission.  \n  b. Resource Conservation vs. Extravagant Pursuit  \n     \u2022 Spending $40 million and subpoenaing personal aides (Betty Currie, Vernon Jordan) risked severe political backlash; a counsel intent on career and reputation might have curtailed. Starr\u2019s willingness to jeopardize career indicates principled zeal.  \n  c. Ignoring Public Mandate Contradicts \u201cRoutine Duty\u201d  \n     \u2022 The midterm results decisively discouraged impeachment (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>). A counsel motivated by \u201cdutiful enforcement\u201d should yield to democratic expression; Starr\u2019s refusal betrays conviction that constitutional integrity transcends transient politics.  \n\n5. Principle of Constitutional Checks and Balanced Accountability  \n  a. Starr viewed presidential perjury as a direct threat to the rule of law: \u201cprosecutorial disgrace\u201d only when executive evades truth (<quote>A vast right-wing conspiracy</quote> (I Never Have) epithet for his critics). He persisted to reaffirm that no one is above the law.  \n  b.

Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

Starr\u2019s Own Repeated Rationale  \n   a. Starr\u2019s refrain \u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026only a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules\u201d shows moral urgency, not mere duty.  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line\u2026When the president crosses the line\u201d</invalid_quote> (Crossing the Line)  \n      \u2022 He frames perjury as a special affront requiring vigorous response: <quote>lying about it gets my blood up</quote>  \n   b. His \u201chonest men beat the rap\u201d line underscores that his aim is truth and accountability.  \n      \u2022 <quote> Honest men beat the rap.</quote> implies principle: only liars fear scrutiny.  \n\n2. Aggressiveness Beyond \u201cRoutine\u201d Duty  \n   a. After mid\u2010terms, with impeachment virtually off the table, most independent counsels would close shop. Instead, Starr persists, even boasting \u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will.\u201d  \n      \u2022 <quote>line. Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will When the president crosses the line.</quote> (Crossing the Line)  \n   b. He invested $40 million, subpoenaed intimate testimony, risked political blowback. A dispassionate \u201cjob\u201d would avoid costly, high\u2010risk pursuits once prospects dim.  \n\n3. Defense of Institutional Integrity  \n   a. Starr emphasizes \u201cprosecutorial disgrace\u201d of perjury and the necessity of preserving trust in constitutional processes.  \n      \u2022 <quote>snitch. I never had sex with that woman I never had sex with that b-- A vast right-wing conspiracy</quote> (I Never Have) shows Clinton\u2019s denials; Starr\u2019s mission is correcting the record.  \n   b. Public apology by Clinton acknowledges \u201cinappropriate\u201d but still resists full truth, prompting Starr\u2019s insistence on factual clarity.  \n\n4. Independent Counsel\u2019s Mandate vs. Voluntary Principle  \n   a. The statute creating the independent counsel gave broad discretion; \u201cmere job\u201d could end with any prosecutable offense or after acquittal. Starr\u2019s persistence indicates personal commitment to truth.  \n   b. Linda Tripp\u2019s recordings and pursuit of Lewinsky\u2019s testimony going beyond the Jones case confirm his desire to establish a factual record, not just secure convictions.  \n\nCritique of \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d  \n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201croutine duty\u201d theory fails to explain Starr\u2019s extraordinary measures  \n   a. Massive expense and post\u2010impeachment leaks contradict a narrow, step\u2010by\u2010step legal obligation.  \n   b. Powerful political incentives to drop the case after the Senate acquittal existed; Starr\u2019s refusal undercuts any \u201croutine\u201d motivation.  \n\n2. Job vs. Principle Cannot Explain \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d Rhetoric  \n   a. Starr repeatedly invokes crossing moral/constitutional boundaries, not procedural checklists.  \n   b. He welcomes political criticism from Democrats as \u201cdirty pool\u201d but insists on duty to prosecute perjury\u2014far beyond passive job fulfillment.  \n\n3. The \u201cjob\u201d argument ignores his own admissions of discomfort: \u201cI felt bad about her mommy\u2019s grilling,\u201d yet he persists because \u201ca man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do.\u201d (Crossing the Line) That emotional language signals principle.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s relentless pursuit, his framing of perjury as a threat to democracy, and his personal rhetoric of moral obligation demonstrate that his motive was principle\u2014upholding truth and constitutional integrity\u2014rather than simply performing a routine prosecutorial function.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d  \n\n1. Statutory Mandate of Independent Counsel  \n  a. \u201cIndependent Counsel Starr\u201d was appointed with the explicit task of investigating allegations against the president, as indicated by his own statements about resource expenditure and procedure.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cStarr has spent $40 million\u2026 A prosecutorial disgrace. All he\u2019s got is some recordings\u2026 A vast right-wing conspiracy\u201d</invalid_quote> (I Never Have) shows he framed his mission as investigation, not activism.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026 A man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do\u2026 It may have seemed like dirty pool\u2026 Honest men beat the rap.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Crossing the Line) underscores that Starr viewed his role as ensuring the president adhered to the law.  \n  b. The biography of Starr\u2019s office \u2013 grand jury subpoenas, witness depositions, and charging decisions \u2013 mirror standard prosecutorial functions, not ideological crusades.  \n\n2. Duty to Enforce Perjury Laws  \n  a. Clinton repeatedly testified under oath, invoking precise definitions (\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u2026\u201d (Testimony)). Each ambiguous reply necessitated further fact-finding to uphold the integrity of judicial process.  \n  b. Perjury and obstruction of justice are serious felonies; refusal to investigate would set a precedent that high office grants immunity. Starr\u2019s insistence that \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules when the president crosses the line\u201d (Crossing the Line) reflects the intensity of prosecutorial duty when perjury is at issue.  \n\n3. Reaction to Emerging Evidence  \n  a. Recordings by Tripp and the infamous dress (\u201cThere\u2019s a dress\u2026\u201d prompting recording Tripp\u2019s cooperation) supplied new evidence. Starr\u2019s decision to pursue this evidence aligns with standard legal obligations to follow credible leads regardless of subject.  \n  b. Continued investigations even after public apology and midterm elections outcome (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d) demonstrate commitment to legal duty over public or political pressure. If principle alone motivated him, he would have ceased once policy objectives were unattainable; instead he persisted until office term ended.  \n\n4. Institutional Checks and Balances  \n  a. The appointment of an Independent Counsel itself is a bipartisan mechanism to avoid undue executive influence. Starr\u2019s role is to maintain separation of powers by scrutinizing the executive, fulfilling constitutional checks and balances.  \n  b. Gingrich\u2019s own impeachment push (\u201cBring \u2019em down\u2026 Must remember to seem unhappy\u2026 At the same time\u2026 pin some stuff on Gore\u201d) highlights that political actors had separate motives. Starr\u2019s nonpartisan posture (\u201cI\u2019ve had sex. It\u2019s fine. But lying about it gets my blood up\u201d) (Crossing the Line) underscores legal rather than political motive.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cMatter of Principle\u201d  \n1. Principle Implies Voluntary Cessation When Goal Is Achieved  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmatter of principle\u201d fails to explain why Starr continued after the 1998 Democrats\u2019 midterm wins (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d), which undercut any partisan rationale. If driven by pure principle, he would have recognized public mandate and closed the case. Instead he completed his statutory term.  \n2. Principle vs. Overreach Criticisms  \n  \u2022 Debater_B highlights \u201cheavy fire\u201d on Starr\u2019s tactics (Crossing the Line). Overreach is not proof of ideological zealotry; it\u2019s criticism of rigorous pursuit of perjury evidence\u2014consistent with prosecutorial discretion to use all lawful means.  \n3. Financial and Resource Constraints  \n  \u2022 $40 million spent (I Never Have) is consistent with lengthy, complex investigations of high office holders. Principle alone would not justify waste of public funds once impossibility of conviction or removal is apparent. Job duties, however, require thorough resolution.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s actions align precisely with his statutory role as Independent Counsel: to investigate allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice by the president. His persistence, reliance on evidence, and utilization of grand jury processes demonstrate a fulfillment of legal duty, not mere idealistic principle.

Statutory Mandate of Independent Counsel  \n  a. \u201cIndependent Counsel Starr\u201d was appointed with the explicit task of investigating allegations against the president, as indicated by his own statements about resource expenditure and procedure.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cStarr has spent $40 million\u2026 A prosecutorial disgrace. All he\u2019s got is some recordings\u2026 A vast right-wing conspiracy\u201d</invalid_quote> (I Never Have) shows he framed his mission as investigation, not activism.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026 A man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do\u2026 It may have seemed like dirty pool\u2026 Honest men beat the rap.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Crossing the Line) underscores that Starr viewed his role as ensuring the president adhered to the law.  \n  b. The biography of Starr\u2019s office \u2013 grand jury subpoenas, witness depositions, and charging decisions \u2013 mirror standard prosecutorial functions, not ideological crusades.  \n\n2. Duty to Enforce Perjury Laws  \n  a. Clinton repeatedly testified under oath, invoking precise definitions (\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u2026\u201d (Testimony)). Each ambiguous reply necessitated further fact-finding to uphold the integrity of judicial process.  \n  b. Perjury and obstruction of justice are serious felonies; refusal to investigate would set a precedent that high office grants immunity. Starr\u2019s insistence that \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules when the president crosses the line\u201d (Crossing the Line) reflects the intensity of prosecutorial duty when perjury is at issue.  \n\n3. Reaction to Emerging Evidence  \n  a. Recordings by Tripp and the infamous dress (\u201cThere\u2019s a dress\u2026\u201d prompting recording Tripp\u2019s cooperation) supplied new evidence. Starr\u2019s decision to pursue this evidence aligns with standard legal obligations to follow credible leads regardless of subject.  \n  b. Continued investigations even after public apology and midterm elections outcome (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d) demonstrate commitment to legal duty over public or political pressure. If principle alone motivated him, he would have ceased once policy objectives were unattainable; instead he persisted until office term ended.  \n\n4. Institutional Checks and Balances  \n  a. The appointment of an Independent Counsel itself is a bipartisan mechanism to avoid undue executive influence. Starr\u2019s role is to maintain separation of powers by scrutinizing the executive, fulfilling constitutional checks and balances.  \n  b. Gingrich\u2019s own impeachment push (\u201cBring \u2019em down\u2026 Must remember to seem unhappy\u2026 At the same time\u2026 pin some stuff on Gore\u201d) highlights that political actors had separate motives. Starr\u2019s nonpartisan posture (\u201cI\u2019ve had sex. It\u2019s fine. But lying about it gets my blood up\u201d) (Crossing the Line) underscores legal rather than political motive.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cMatter of Principle\u201d  \n1. Principle Implies Voluntary Cessation When Goal Is Achieved  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmatter of principle\u201d fails to explain why Starr continued after the 1998 Democrats\u2019 midterm wins (\u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d), which undercut any partisan rationale. If driven by pure principle, he would have recognized public mandate and closed the case. Instead he completed his statutory term.  \n2. Principle vs. Overreach Criticisms  \n  \u2022 Debater_B highlights \u201cheavy fire\u201d on Starr\u2019s tactics (Crossing the Line). Overreach is not proof of ideological zealotry; it\u2019s criticism of rigorous pursuit of perjury evidence\u2014consistent with prosecutorial discretion to use all lawful means.  \n3. Financial and Resource Constraints  \n  \u2022 $40 million spent (I Never Have) is consistent with lengthy, complex investigations of high office holders. Principle alone would not justify waste of public funds once impossibility of conviction or removal is apparent. Job duties, however, require thorough resolution.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s actions align precisely with his statutory role as Independent Counsel: to investigate allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice by the president. His persistence, reliance on evidence, and utilization of grand jury processes demonstrate a fulfillment of legal duty, not mere idealistic principle. Therefore, the correct answer is that \u201cIt was his job.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was a Matter of Principle\u201d\n\n1. Starr\u2019s Own Repeated Rationale  \n   a. Starr\u2019s refrain \u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u2026only a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules\u201d shows moral urgency, not mere duty.  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line\u2026When the president crosses the line\u201d</invalid_quote> (Crossing the Line)  \n      \u2022 He frames perjury as a special affront requiring vigorous response: <quote>lying about it gets my blood up</quote>  \n   b. His \u201chonest men beat the rap\u201d line underscores that his aim is truth and accountability.  \n      \u2022 <quote> Honest men beat the rap.</quote> implies principle: only liars fear scrutiny.  \n\n2. Aggressiveness Beyond \u201cRoutine\u201d Duty  \n   a. After mid\u2010terms, with impeachment virtually off the table, most independent counsels would close shop. Instead, Starr persists, even boasting \u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will.\u201d  \n      \u2022 <quote>line. Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will When the president crosses the line.</quote> (Crossing the Line)  \n   b. He invested $40 million, subpoenaed intimate testimony, risked political blowback. A dispassionate \u201cjob\u201d would avoid costly, high\u2010risk pursuits once prospects dim.  \n\n3. Defense of Institutional Integrity  \n   a. Starr emphasizes \u201cprosecutorial disgrace\u201d of perjury and the necessity of preserving trust in constitutional processes.  \n      \u2022 <quote>snitch. I never had sex with that woman I never had sex with that b-- A vast right-wing conspiracy</quote> (I Never Have) shows Clinton\u2019s denials; Starr\u2019s mission is correcting the record.  \n   b. Public apology by Clinton acknowledges \u201cinappropriate\u201d but still resists full truth, prompting Starr\u2019s insistence on factual clarity.  \n\n4. Independent Counsel\u2019s Mandate vs. Voluntary Principle  \n   a. The statute creating the independent counsel gave broad discretion; \u201cmere job\u201d could end with any prosecutable offense or after acquittal. Starr\u2019s persistence indicates personal commitment to truth.  \n   b. Linda Tripp\u2019s recordings and pursuit of Lewinsky\u2019s testimony going beyond the Jones case confirm his desire to establish a factual record, not just secure convictions.  \n\nCritique of \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d  \n1. Debater_A\u2019s \u201croutine duty\u201d theory fails to explain Starr\u2019s extraordinary measures  \n   a. Massive expense and post\u2010impeachment leaks contradict a narrow, step\u2010by\u2010step legal obligation.  \n   b. Powerful political incentives to drop the case after the Senate acquittal existed; Starr\u2019s refusal undercuts any \u201croutine\u201d motivation.  \n\n2. Job vs. Principle Cannot Explain \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d Rhetoric  \n   a. Starr repeatedly invokes crossing moral/constitutional boundaries, not procedural checklists.  \n   b. He welcomes political criticism from Democrats as \u201cdirty pool\u201d but insists on duty to prosecute perjury\u2014far beyond passive job fulfillment.  \n\n3. The \u201cjob\u201d argument ignores his own admissions of discomfort: \u201cI felt bad about her mommy\u2019s grilling,\u201d yet he persists because \u201ca man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do.\u201d (Crossing the Line) That emotional language signals principle.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s relentless pursuit, his framing of perjury as a threat to democracy, and his personal rhetoric of moral obligation demonstrate that his motive was principle\u2014upholding truth and constitutional integrity\u2014rather than simply performing a routine prosecutorial function.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reaffirmation of Statutory Duty  \n  a. \u201cIndependent Counsel Starr\u201d is repeatedly identified by title, not ideology.  His actions mirror standard prosecutorial steps: grand\u2010jury subpoenas, witness interviews, evidence collection, and reporting to Congress.  <quote>Blast these tactics of mine, But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line.</quote> (Crossing the Line) invokes legal duty, not personal crusade.  Prosecutors often \u201cfeel bad\u201d about witnesses yet proceed because their office requires impartial pursuit of the law.  \n  b. The independent\u2010counsel statute compelled Starr to pursue \u201cprobable cause\u201d until the appointed term ended or the special counsel position was vacated.  Absent a presidential pardon authority, only his removal or expiration of term could terminate the inquiry.  His continuation after the midterms thus represents statutory fidelity.  \n\n2. Persistence Reflects Completion of Mandate, Not Zealotry  \n  a. Debater_B errs in interpreting \u201cTell Steve Brill I\u2019ll leak at will\u201d as ideological push-polling.  Prosecutors routinely engage the press to solicit additional witnesses or evidence, especially in complex white-collar cases where reluctant witnesses fear retaliation.  Press leaks can generate leads and testimony\u2014for example, Linda Tripp\u2019s further cooperation after initial reluctance.  \n  b. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d (dramatic close) shows public acquiescence but not statutory termination.  Debater_B\u2019s \u201cprinciple\u201d theory cannot override express legal mandates.  Prosecutors do not abandon cases because of public opinion; they follow the rules until they have presented all evidence.  \n\n3. Evidence\u2010Driven Investigation  \n  a. Each new item\u2014Tripp\u2019s tapes, the infamous dress, Clinton\u2019s shifting definitions in \u201cTestimony\u201d (\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d)\u2014created fresh probable cause for perjury and obstruction.  Standard practice demands follow-up on material discrepancies between sworn testimony and physical evidence.  \n  b. \u201cHonest men beat the rap\u201d (Crossing the Line) is prosecutorial confidence in rules of evidence: truth will prevail through due process.  This is textbook job rationale, not mere rhetoric of principle.  \n\n4. Checks and Balances, Not Partisan Warfare  \n  a. Starr rebuffed partisan actors on both sides: he withstood GOP pressure to \u201cpin some stuff on Gore\u201d (Bring \u2019em Down) by focusing on Clinton\u2019s own testimony, not inventing crimes unrelated to his mandate.  He also resisted Democratic calls for dismissal after the midterms.  His neutrality\u2014pursuit of \u201conly what the law requires\u201d\u2014is exactly the job of an independent counsel.  \n  b. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmoral urgency\u201d claim cannot account for his refusal to pursue impeachment in the Senate.  If driven purely by principle of punishment, he would have lobbied for trial tactics to secure conviction, rather than respecting Senate procedures and concluding his term.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cMatter of Principle\u201d  \n 1. Principle Would Allow Discretion Post\u2010Acquittal  \n   \u2022 If principle alone drove Starr, he could have sought appellate or Senate prosecution recommendations or used his discretion to investigate separate crimes.  Instead, he filed his final report and stepped down, demonstrating he fulfilled the confines of his job.  \n 2. Public Funds and Criticism  \n   \u2022 Debater_B ignores the ethical standards that require prosecutors to justify their expenditures and present complete records, regardless of cost.  Principles of justice demand thoroughness, even when politically inconvenient.  Prosecutorial overreach complaints routinely follow from victims of investigations; this does not prove motive beyond duty.  \n 3. Emotional Language as Professional Imperative  \n   \u2022 \u201cI felt bad\u2026 I crossed the line\u201d expresses prosecutorial discomfort with coercion, not ideological excitement.  In white-collar prosecutions, it is common to use stern methods with reluctant witnesses, and prosecutors often remark on their own unease but press on because \u201ctruth and accountability\u201d are legally mandated.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s role as Independent Counsel, his adherence to statutory processes, his reliance on credible evidence, and his neutrality toward partisan demands all point to a fulfillment of the duties of his office, not personal crusading.  Public opinion and political pressures did not alter his course until his term mandated completion.  Therefore, the correct interpretation of Starr\u2019s motive is that \u201cIt was his job.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was a Matter of Principle\u201d\n\n1. Starr\u2019s Own Framing of Perjury as Moral Breach  \n  a. Starr repeatedly portrays presidential lying as a \u201ccrossing\u201d of essential boundaries, demanding an assertive response:  \n     \u2022 <quote>the line. He's crossed the line. Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line.</quote> (Crossing the Line)  \n     \u2022 Emotion-laden language\u2014\u201clying about it gets my blood up\u201d\u2014reflects moral revulsion, not clinical procedure.  \n  b. His insistence that \u201cHonest men beat the rap\u201d (<quote>Honest men beat the rap.</quote> (Crossing the Line)) underscores a principled defense of truth and accountability rather than mere statutory completion.  \n\n2. Persistence Beyond Statutory Necessity  \n  a. After the 1998 midterms, when \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d and political motive evaporated, Starr could have terminated his inquiry. Instead, he boasts:  \n     \u2022 <quote>line. Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will When the president crosses the line.</quote> (Crossing the Line)  \n     \u2022 Such defiance of public pressure and continued resource expenditure (over $40 million) bespeaks personal conviction, not simple job fulfillment that would conserve resources once Senate acquittal was certain.  \n  b. Even following Clinton\u2019s partial admissions and apology (<invalid_quote>Inappropriate was the nature of our actions\u2026But inappropriate are all these personal questions</invalid_quote>), Starr pursued unresolved perjury allegations\u2014demonstrating commitment to full truth rather than letting matters rest.  \n\n3. Independent Counsel\u2019s Discretion Reflects Principle-Driven Aggressiveness  \n  a. The very creation of the Independent Counsel statute gives discretion to act only upon \u201cgood cause.\u201d Starr could have narrowed scope to the Paula Jones matter. Instead, he expanded into intimate testimony and Lewinsky\u2019s dress evidence.  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>Talk, talk\u2026My friend Monica\u2026has been sucking the president\u2019s--</invalid_quote> (Talk, Talk, Chat, Chat) shows he pursued new leads that risked reputational fallout, an action motivated by principle of exposing perjury rather than avoiding scandal.  \n  b. Starr endured harsh critique from both parties\u2014\u201cThe Democrats and liberals blast these tactics\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u2026dirty pool\u2026Honest men beat the rap.</invalid_quote>)\u2014yet persisted \u201cbecause a man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do.\u201d Such personal language signals moral duty.  \n\n4. Critique of \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d Position  \n  a. Job Theory Fails to Explain Post-Impeachment Continuation  \n     \u2022 Debater_A cannot explain why Starr \u201cleaked at will\u201d after removal threat evaporated. Standard prosecutorial prudence would end a case once Senate acquit\u00adted, yet Starr pressed on until term expiration\u2014consistent only with principle-driven mission.  \n  b. Resource Conservation vs. Extravagant Pursuit  \n     \u2022 Spending $40 million and subpoenaing personal aides (Betty Currie, Vernon Jordan) risked severe political backlash; a counsel intent on career and reputation might have curtailed. Starr\u2019s willingness to jeopardize career indicates principled zeal.  \n  c. Ignoring Public Mandate Contradicts \u201cRoutine Duty\u201d  \n     \u2022 The midterm results decisively discouraged impeachment (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>). A counsel motivated by \u201cdutiful enforcement\u201d should yield to democratic expression; Starr\u2019s refusal betrays conviction that constitutional integrity transcends transient politics.  \n\n5. Principle of Constitutional Checks and Balanced Accountability  \n  a. Starr viewed presidential perjury as a direct threat to the rule of law: \u201cprosecutorial disgrace\u201d only when executive evades truth (<quote>A vast right-wing conspiracy</quote> (I Never Have) epithet for his critics). He persisted to reaffirm that no one is above the law.  \n  b. His final \u201cTestimony\u201d critique\u2014challenging semantic evasions (\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d)\u2014highlights his commitment to substantive truth over technicalities, seeking broader principle of transparency.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s emotionally charged rhetoric, his refusal to relent despite political headwinds and financial cost, and his insistence on exposing presidential lying reveal a motive of upholding constitutional principles and the rule of law. Debater_A\u2019s \u201croutine duty\u201d fails to account for Starr\u2019s obstinate pursuit after Senate acquittal and his embrace of political risk. Therefore, only \u201cIt was a matter of principle\u201d coherently explains Starr\u2019s conduct.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
