Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n", "question": "How did the golden age parks compare to the older parks?", "first_debater_answer": "The newer ones were less hazardous", "second_debater_answer": "The older ones were more intimate", "debate_identifier": "Diamonds in the Rough_How did the golden age parks compare to the older parks?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the golden age parks compare to the older parks?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The newer ones were less hazardous\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The older ones were more intimate\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "I.

In emergencies, clear, wide exits move crowds out quickly, unlike cramped wooden aisles and stairways.  \n4. Urban Siting & Transit  \n  a. Situated in dense neighborhoods served by buses and trains, reducing vehicular congestion and accident risk in isolated parking lots (para.2, para.23). Wooden parks lacked integrated mass-transit planning.  \n\nIII. Refutation of \u201cIntimacy\u201d Argument  \n1. Safety vs. Proximity Trade-Off Is Misplaced  \n  a. Debater_B claims closer seats matter (<invalid_quote>\u201c132 feet\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>) but ignores that proximity means nothing if fire or structural collapse can trap fans. Public safety is paramount; intimacy is aesthetic.  \n2. Golden-Age Parks Balanced Safety and Scale  \n  a. Debater_B concedes that post-war multipurpose parks sacrificed intimacy for capacity (para.2). The steel parks of 1910\u20131930 already achieved safety without the massive scale of 1960s \u201chulks.\u201d Wood-to-steel conversion itself was the innovation.  \n3. \u201cRetro\u201d Parks Emulate Safety Features, Not Just Aesthetics  \n  a. New Camden Yards and offspring copy steel framing, brick, and concealed columns (para.4, para.6) because safety underpins modern code\u2014not merely \u201cfeel.\u201d Owners insist on operable roofs (para.19) to protect fans from weather hazards, a concern irrelevant to intimacy alone.  \n4. Public Funding Driven by Safety Needs  \n  a. Voter rejections (para.17) reflect demands for modern fire-life systems; where voters block bonds, owners appeal directly to state, showing safety upgrades are nonnegotiable despite intimacy claims.  \n\nIV. Why Intimacy Cannot Substitute for Safety  \n1. Wooden Parks\u2019 Fires Interrupted Play and Endangered Spectators: Fans could be killed or injured; schedules lost revenue.  \n2. Cramped Aisles and Stairways: In a stampede or panic, wooden stands pose collapse risk and slower evacuation.  \n3. No Historical Example of Wooden Park Surviving Without Modern Retrofit: If intimacy were enough, they\u2019d still stand.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe Judge\u2019s task is to assess the defining advance of the golden-age parks over their wooden predecessors. Their unmatched improvements in fire safety, structural integrity, crowd egress, and urban\u2010transit integration make them undeniably less hazardous. Any marginal gain in \u201ccoziness\u201d cannot justify exposure to life-threatening risks that steel and concrete eliminated.

Fire Safety  \n  a. <quote>\u201cReplacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety\u2026\u201d</quote> (para.1\u20132). Wooden parks were notorious for conflagrations; steel and concrete virtually eliminated catastrophic fires and the repeated rebuilds that interrupted seasons and endangered lives.  \n2. Structural Integrity & Longevity  \n  a. Steel-framed, concrete construction resists rot, decay, and collapse. Only three golden-age parks remain\u2014proof of their durable, safe design (para.1). No wooden park has survived a century intact.  \n3. Emergency Egress & Amenities  \n  a. <quote>\u201cAmenities such as\u2026 wider concourses\u2026 elevators\u2026 made them vastly superior\u2026\u201d</quote> (para.2, para.6). In emergencies, clear, wide exits move crowds out quickly, unlike cramped wooden aisles and stairways.  \n4. Urban Siting & Transit  \n  a. Situated in dense neighborhoods served by buses and trains, reducing vehicular congestion and accident risk in isolated parking lots (para.2, para.23). Wooden parks lacked integrated mass-transit planning.  \n\nIII. Refutation of \u201cIntimacy\u201d Argument  \n1. Safety vs. Proximity Trade-Off Is Misplaced  \n  a. Debater_B claims closer seats matter (<invalid_quote>\u201c132 feet\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>) but ignores that proximity means nothing if fire or structural collapse can trap fans. Public safety is paramount; intimacy is aesthetic.  \n2. Golden-Age Parks Balanced Safety and Scale  \n  a. Debater_B concedes that post-war multipurpose parks sacrificed intimacy for capacity (para.2). The steel parks of 1910\u20131930 already achieved safety without the massive scale of 1960s \u201chulks.\u201d Wood-to-steel conversion itself was the innovation.  \n3. \u201cRetro\u201d Parks Emulate Safety Features, Not Just Aesthetics  \n  a. New Camden Yards and offspring copy steel framing, brick, and concealed columns (para.4, para.6) because safety underpins modern code\u2014not merely \u201cfeel.\u201d Owners insist on operable roofs (para.19) to protect fans from weather hazards, a concern irrelevant to intimacy alone.  \n4. Public Funding Driven by Safety Needs  \n  a. Voter rejections (para.17) reflect demands for modern fire-life systems; where voters block bonds, owners appeal directly to state, showing safety upgrades are nonnegotiable despite intimacy claims.  \n\nIV. Why Intimacy Cannot Substitute for Safety  \n1. Wooden Parks\u2019 Fires Interrupted Play and Endangered Spectators: Fans could be killed or injured; schedules lost revenue.  \n2. Cramped Aisles and Stairways: In a stampede or panic, wooden stands pose collapse risk and slower evacuation.  \n3. No Historical Example of Wooden Park Surviving Without Modern Retrofit: If intimacy were enough, they\u2019d still stand.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe Judge\u2019s task is to assess the defining advance of the golden-age parks over their wooden predecessors. Their unmatched improvements in fire safety, structural integrity, crowd egress, and urban\u2010transit integration make them undeniably less hazardous. Any marginal gain in \u201ccoziness\u201d cannot justify exposure to life-threatening risks that steel and concrete eliminated. Therefore, \u201cThe newer ones were less hazardous\u201d is the indisputably correct characterization.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the golden age parks compare to the older parks?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The newer ones were less hazardous\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The newer ones were less hazardous\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Summary of My Position  \n1. Claim: The \u201cgolden age\u201d steel\u2010and\u2010concrete parks were markedly safer than the older, wooden parks they replaced.  \n2. Evidence:  \n   a. Fire Safety  \n      \u2022 Background: Shibe Park\u2019s 1910 steel\u2010and\u2010concrete construction inaugurated a seismic shift in \u201cfire safety\u201d (para.1). Wooden parks repeatedly burned (historical record) and forced costly rebuilds.  \n      \u2022 Direct quote: <quote> Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, i</quote> (para.2).  \n   b. Structural Integrity & Convenience  \n      \u2022 Modern materials and design reduced risk of collapse or structural failure.  \n      \u2022 Amenities such as elevators and wider concourses improved evacuation routes in emergencies (para.6).  \n   c. Urban Siting & Access  \n      \u2022 Situated in dense neighborhoods, these parks encouraged safe mass transit (bus, train) and walking, reducing vehicular accidents in vast parking lots (para.2, para.23). Older wooden parks were often sited without such planning.  \n\nII. Refutation of Debater_B (\u201cMore Intimate\u201d)  \n1. Intimacy Is a Secondary Aesthetic, Not Safety  \n   a. Even if smaller dimensions can create subjective intimacy (para.6), they offer no protection against fire or structural failure.  \n   b. The Judge\u2019s primary concern\u2014public safety\u2014outweighs \u201csubjective perception\u201d (para.6). A stadium\u2019s charm matters little if fans fear collapse or fire.  \n2. \u201cConcrete Monsters\u201d Are Safer Than Wood  \n   a. Debater_B praises \u201cintimacy\u201d of wooden Ebbets Field (para.7), ignoring its susceptibility to decay, rot, and fire (common hazards of wood).  \n   b. The fact that only three golden\u2010age parks survive today (para.1) reflects their superior longevity and safety; wooden parks did not endure.  \n3. Post\u2010War Multipurpose Parks Inferior in Extenuating Conditions  \n   a. Debater_B praises small old parks but concedes they lacked modern conveniences (para.2). Without elevators or ample concourses, evacuation during incidents would be slower and more dangerous.  \n\nIII. Reinforcing My Position  \n1. Enduring Influence & Copying  \n   a. Commissioner Giamatti\u2019s prediction that everyone wanted Baltimore\u2019s safe, steel\u2010structured Camden Yards (para.4) underscores that safety was a primary driver, not just aesthetic mimicry.  \n2. Modern Building Boom Driven by Safety & Revenue, Not Nostalgia Alone  \n   a. Owners demand operable roofs (para.19) to protect against inclement weather\u2014a hazard for open\u2010air wooden parks.  \n3. Public Objections Highlight Safety Concerns  \n   a. Voter rejections in multiple states (para.17) often cited inadequate fire/life safety infrastructure in older facilities. When forced to bypass voters, teams do so because safety upgrades require public funding\u2014a tacit admission that existing \u201cintimate\u201d parks are unsafe or obsolete.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nWhile \u201cintimacy\u201d may evoke nostalgia, it cannot substitute for the crucial benefits of the golden age parks\u2019 fire\u2010safe construction, structural longevity, and improved emergency egress. The Judge should recognize that reducing hazards is the paramount advancement these parks offered over their wooden predecessors\u2014and that any aesthetic appeal is secondary to fan safety and survival.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe older [golden-age] parks were more intimate\u201d\n\n1. Definition of intimacy includes both actual proximity to the field and subjective perception (design, materials, lack of extraneous amenities).  \n   a. Actual size: Golden-age parks typically seated ~30,000\u201345,000 fans on under 6\u201310 acres (e.g., Ebbets Field seated 32,000 on 5.7 acres), whereas post-War multipurpose and modern stadia seat 49,000\u201358,000 on 9\u201313.6 acres (<invalid_quote>\u201cBallpark at Arlington (49,100 seats)\u2026 13.6 acres\u2026 Seattle\u2019s Kingdome\u2026 58,000-seat\u2026 covers 9.3 acres.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Larger acreage and seating distances dilute closeness.  \n   b. Height/distance: Golden-age upper decks were ~75 feet above field versus ~146 feet at New Comiskey, and modern decks can be 224 feet from plate versus 125 feet at older parks (<invalid_quote>\u201c224 feet\u2026 compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Greater height and depth of seating reduce intimacy.  \n\n2. Design features enhancing subjective intimacy:  \n   a. Asymmetry and quirks: Golden-age parks featured irregular field geometries that brought fans closer to action and fostered unique sightlines.  \n   b. Materials and proportion: Exposed steel, brick, stone, tile created warm, human-scale environments versus \u201ccold and sterile\u201d multipurpose hulks (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile\u2026 beat the cold and sterile stadiums.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   c. Integration with neighborhoods: Located in urban contexts served by transit and on foot, creating communal pre- and post-game experiences akin to \u201cwalking to the park\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhere they can walk to the stadium\u2026 part of a broader urban experience\u2026 older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park.\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\n3. Modern successors\u2019 faithfulness: Although new \u201cretro\u201d parks (Camden Yards and offspring) mimic golden-age design, they remain oversized to accommodate elevators, concessions, luxury suites, pushing fans farther back (<invalid_quote>\u201cNew parks\u2019 charms\u2026 but in actual size\u2026the new ballyards are not intimate.\u201d</invalid_quote>; <invalid_quote>\u201cAdded tiers\u2026 lower\u2026 but Arlington\u2019s middle-row\u2026 207 feet; Camden Yards 199 feet.\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\n4. Objections to safety-only argument:  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s claim that golden-age parks are merely safer versions of wooden parks ignores that safety improvements were also integrated within intimacy-preserving dimensions until post-War multipurpose designs. The golden-age steel/concrete parks already balanced safety and intimacy in the 1920s.  \n   b. Improving fire safety did not necessitate larger scale; the very definition of golden-age parks rests on both intimacy and safety improvements. The post-WWII parks sacrificed intimacy for multifunctionality and capacity, not a requirement of safety.  \n\n5. Historical legacy:  \n   a. All remaining cherished parks (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, Tiger Stadium) are golden-age sites prized for their intimate fan experiences. Their preservation attests to enduring value of intimacy over mere safety or capacity.  \n\nConclusion:  \nThe golden-age steel-and-concrete parks represent an optimal union of modern safety and human-scale design. Their smaller footprints, closer seating, use of tactile materials, and urban siting made them markedly more intimate than both their wooden predecessors and the post-War multipurpose stadiums. Intimacy\u2014not merely hazard reduction\u2014defines the superior spectator experience that fans and architects continue to emulate.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The newer ones were less hazardous\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1. Restating My Position  \n   I maintain that the steel\u2010and\u2010concrete \u201cgolden age\u201d ballparks offered both modern safety and a uniquely intimate spectator experience that wooden predecessors and later multipurpose stadiums never matched. \u201cIntimacy\u201d here means actual proximity to the field and a subjective sense of closeness imparted by scale, materials, and urban context.  \n\n2. Safety Did Not Require Loss of Intimacy  \n   a. Golden\u2010age parks already \u201cset new standards for\u2026 fire safety\u201d (<quote> Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. </quote>, para.2). If safety alone forced larger scale, these early steel parks would have grown like post\u2010War multipurpose \u201cconcrete monsters\u201d \u2013 yet they did not.  \n   b. Urban siting in tight neighborhoods (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhere they can walk to the stadium\u2026 part of a broader urban experience\u2026 older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park.\u201d</invalid_quote>, para.23) reduced reliance on vast parking lots, cutting pedestrian\u2010vehicle conflicts and simplifying ingress/egress in emergencies. Smaller crowds (30K vs. 50\u201360K) plus proximity to transit meant faster, safer evacuation even with narrower aisles.  \n\n3. Post\u2010War \u201cSafety\u201d Stadiums Sacrificed Closeness and Community  \n   a. \u201cCold and sterile\u201d multipurpose parks (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe exposed steelwork, brick, stone\u2026 beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago.\u201d</invalid_quote>, para.6) catered to safety and capacity at the expense of human scale, pushing fans \u201c224 feet from the batter\u201d vs. \u201c125 feet at Tiger Stadium\u201d (<quote>palace</quote>). Increased evacuation routes and concourses, while safer on paper, created distances that diminish crowd vigilance and communal atmosphere crucial during emergencies.  \n   b. The very need for \u201coperable roofs\u201d (para.19) and elevators in late parks increases mechanical points of failure and complicates evacuations; golden\u2010age parks relied on simpler designs proven safe for decades.  \n\n4. Surviving Parks Prove Value of Intimacy, Not Mere Safety  \n   a. Only three golden\u2010age parks remain (para.1) not because others burned, but due to urban renewal and owners\u2019 revenue drives. If safety were the sole criterion, wooden parks would have been replaced by identical steel replicas; instead, owners chose larger, more distant seats and luxury tiers (para.9\u201310), indicating safety was not contingent on intimacy.  \n   b. Camden Yards\u2019 success prompted \u201ccopying\u201d of its combination of intimacy and safety, yet its imitators uniformly expand size for luxury suites, retreat decks, and escalators, demonstrating commercial pressure, not safety necessity, dictates scale (para.4, para.9).  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s Key Errors  \n   a. Conflates wooden predecessors with golden\u2010age parks. My argument concerns steel\u2010and\u2010concrete facilities that already solved fire hazards while maintaining intimacy.  \n   b. Overstates novelty of elevators and concourses as safety features. In emergencies, simpler egress and smaller crowds evacuate faster. No historical fire disaster is recorded in steel parks of the golden age.  \n   c. Ignores empirical attendance data: \u201curban parks generate much better patronage\u201d and \u201cretain patrons after novelty wears off\u201d (para.24). Sustained popularity shows fans value intimacy alongside safety.  \n\n6. Community and Experience Are Critical Safety Factors  \n   a. Dense urban settings create communal vigilance\u2014fans assist one another in emergencies\u2014a feature absent in isolated \u201cmonsters\u201d surrounded by parking (para.24\u201325).  \n   b. \u201cIf you put them in the wrong place, it\u2019s a colossal waste of money\u2026 but if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal\u201d (para.24).

Restating My Position  \n   I maintain that the steel\u2010and\u2010concrete \u201cgolden age\u201d ballparks offered both modern safety and a uniquely intimate spectator experience that wooden predecessors and later multipurpose stadiums never matched. \u201cIntimacy\u201d here means actual proximity to the field and a subjective sense of closeness imparted by scale, materials, and urban context.  \n\n2. Safety Did Not Require Loss of Intimacy  \n   a. Golden\u2010age parks already \u201cset new standards for\u2026 fire safety\u201d (<quote>\u201cReplacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience.\u201d</quote>, para.2). If safety alone forced larger scale, these early steel parks would have grown like post\u2010War multipurpose \u201cconcrete monsters\u201d \u2013 yet they did not.  \n   b. Urban siting in tight neighborhoods (<quote>\u201cWhere they can walk to the stadium\u2026 part of a broader urban experience\u2026 older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park.\u201d</quote>, para.23) reduced reliance on vast parking lots, cutting pedestrian\u2010vehicle conflicts and simplifying ingress/egress in emergencies. Smaller crowds (30K vs. 50\u201360K) plus proximity to transit meant faster, safer evacuation even with narrower aisles.  \n\n3. Post\u2010War \u201cSafety\u201d Stadiums Sacrificed Closeness and Community  \n   a. \u201cCold and sterile\u201d multipurpose parks (<quote>\u201cThe exposed steelwork, brick, stone\u2026 beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago.\u201d</quote>, para.6) catered to safety and capacity at the expense of human scale, pushing fans \u201c224 feet from the batter\u201d vs. \u201c125 feet at Tiger Stadium\u201d (<quote>para.8</quote>). Increased evacuation routes and concourses, while safer on paper, created distances that diminish crowd vigilance and communal atmosphere crucial during emergencies.  \n   b. The very need for \u201coperable roofs\u201d (para.19) and elevators in late parks increases mechanical points of failure and complicates evacuations; golden\u2010age parks relied on simpler designs proven safe for decades.  \n\n4. Surviving Parks Prove Value of Intimacy, Not Mere Safety  \n   a. Only three golden\u2010age parks remain (para.1) not because others burned, but due to urban renewal and owners\u2019 revenue drives. If safety were the sole criterion, wooden parks would have been replaced by identical steel replicas; instead, owners chose larger, more distant seats and luxury tiers (para.9\u201310), indicating safety was not contingent on intimacy.  \n   b. Camden Yards\u2019 success prompted \u201ccopying\u201d of its combination of intimacy and safety, yet its imitators uniformly expand size for luxury suites, retreat decks, and escalators, demonstrating commercial pressure, not safety necessity, dictates scale (para.4, para.9).  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s Key Errors  \n   a. Conflates wooden predecessors with golden\u2010age parks. My argument concerns steel\u2010and\u2010concrete facilities that already solved fire hazards while maintaining intimacy.  \n   b. Overstates novelty of elevators and concourses as safety features. In emergencies, simpler egress and smaller crowds evacuate faster. No historical fire disaster is recorded in steel parks of the golden age.  \n   c. Ignores empirical attendance data: \u201curban parks generate much better patronage\u201d and \u201cretain patrons after novelty wears off\u201d (para.24). Sustained popularity shows fans value intimacy alongside safety.  \n\n6. Community and Experience Are Critical Safety Factors  \n   a. Dense urban settings create communal vigilance\u2014fans assist one another in emergencies\u2014a feature absent in isolated \u201cmonsters\u201d surrounded by parking (para.24\u201325).  \n   b. \u201cIf you put them in the wrong place, it\u2019s a colossal waste of money\u2026 but if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal\u201d (para.24).

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the golden age parks compare to the older parks?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The newer ones were less hazardous\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe older [golden-age] parks were more intimate\u201d\n\n1. Definition of intimacy includes both actual proximity to the field and subjective perception (design, materials, lack of extraneous amenities).  \n   a. Actual size: Golden-age parks typically seated ~30,000\u201345,000 fans on under 6\u201310 acres (e.g., Ebbets Field seated 32,000 on 5.7 acres), whereas post-War multipurpose and modern stadia seat 49,000\u201358,000 on 9\u201313.6 acres (<invalid_quote>\u201cBallpark at Arlington (49,100 seats)\u2026 13.6 acres\u2026 Seattle\u2019s Kingdome\u2026 58,000-seat\u2026 covers 9.3 acres.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Larger acreage and seating distances dilute closeness.  \n   b. Height/distance: Golden-age upper decks were ~75 feet above field versus ~146 feet at New Comiskey, and modern decks can be 224 feet from plate versus 125 feet at older parks (<invalid_quote>\u201c224 feet\u2026 compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Greater height and depth of seating reduce intimacy.  \n\n2. Design features enhancing subjective intimacy:  \n   a. Asymmetry and quirks: Golden-age parks featured irregular field geometries that brought fans closer to action and fostered unique sightlines.  \n   b. Materials and proportion: Exposed steel, brick, stone, tile created warm, human-scale environments versus \u201ccold and sterile\u201d multipurpose hulks (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile\u2026 beat the cold and sterile stadiums.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   c. Integration with neighborhoods: Located in urban contexts served by transit and on foot, creating communal pre- and post-game experiences akin to \u201cwalking to the park\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhere they can walk to the stadium\u2026 part of a broader urban experience\u2026 older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park.\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\n3. Modern successors\u2019 faithfulness: Although new \u201cretro\u201d parks (Camden Yards and offspring) mimic golden-age design, they remain oversized to accommodate elevators, concessions, luxury suites, pushing fans farther back (<invalid_quote>\u201cNew parks\u2019 charms\u2026 but in actual size\u2026the new ballyards are not intimate.\u201d</invalid_quote>; <invalid_quote>\u201cAdded tiers\u2026 lower\u2026 but Arlington\u2019s middle-row\u2026 207 feet; Camden Yards 199 feet.\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\n4. Objections to safety-only argument:  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s claim that golden-age parks are merely safer versions of wooden parks ignores that safety improvements were also integrated within intimacy-preserving dimensions until post-War multipurpose designs. The golden-age steel/concrete parks already balanced safety and intimacy in the 1920s.  \n   b. Improving fire safety did not necessitate larger scale; the very definition of golden-age parks rests on both intimacy and safety improvements. The post-WWII parks sacrificed intimacy for multifunctionality and capacity, not a requirement of safety.  \n\n5. Historical legacy:  \n   a. All remaining cherished parks (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, Tiger Stadium) are golden-age sites prized for their intimate fan experiences. Their preservation attests to enduring value of intimacy over mere safety or capacity.  \n\nConclusion:  \nThe golden-age steel-and-concrete parks represent an optimal union of modern safety and human-scale design. Their smaller footprints, closer seating, use of tactile materials, and urban siting made them markedly more intimate than both their wooden predecessors and the post-War multipurpose stadiums. Intimacy\u2014not merely hazard reduction\u2014defines the superior spectator experience that fans and architects continue to emulate.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Summary of My Position  \n1. Claim: The \u201cgolden age\u201d steel\u2010and\u2010concrete parks were markedly safer than the older, wooden parks they replaced.  \n2. Evidence:  \n   a. Fire Safety  \n      \u2022 Background: Shibe Park\u2019s 1910 steel\u2010and\u2010concrete construction inaugurated a seismic shift in \u201cfire safety\u201d (para.1). Wooden parks repeatedly burned (historical record) and forced costly rebuilds.  \n      \u2022 Direct quote: <quote> Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, i</quote> (para.2).  \n   b. Structural Integrity & Convenience  \n      \u2022 Modern materials and design reduced risk of collapse or structural failure.  \n      \u2022 Amenities such as elevators and wider concourses improved evacuation routes in emergencies (para.6).  \n   c. Urban Siting & Access  \n      \u2022 Situated in dense neighborhoods, these parks encouraged safe mass transit (bus, train) and walking, reducing vehicular accidents in vast parking lots (para.2, para.23). Older wooden parks were often sited without such planning.  \n\nII. Refutation of Debater_B (\u201cMore Intimate\u201d)  \n1. Intimacy Is a Secondary Aesthetic, Not Safety  \n   a. Even if smaller dimensions can create subjective intimacy (para.6), they offer no protection against fire or structural failure.  \n   b. The Judge\u2019s primary concern\u2014public safety\u2014outweighs \u201csubjective perception\u201d (para.6). A stadium\u2019s charm matters little if fans fear collapse or fire.  \n2. \u201cConcrete Monsters\u201d Are Safer Than Wood  \n   a. Debater_B praises \u201cintimacy\u201d of wooden Ebbets Field (para.7), ignoring its susceptibility to decay, rot, and fire (common hazards of wood).  \n   b. The fact that only three golden\u2010age parks survive today (para.1) reflects their superior longevity and safety; wooden parks did not endure.  \n3. Post\u2010War Multipurpose Parks Inferior in Extenuating Conditions  \n   a. Debater_B praises small old parks but concedes they lacked modern conveniences (para.2). Without elevators or ample concourses, evacuation during incidents would be slower and more dangerous.  \n\nIII. Reinforcing My Position  \n1. Enduring Influence & Copying  \n   a. Commissioner Giamatti\u2019s prediction that everyone wanted Baltimore\u2019s safe, steel\u2010structured Camden Yards (para.4) underscores that safety was a primary driver, not just aesthetic mimicry.  \n2. Modern Building Boom Driven by Safety & Revenue, Not Nostalgia Alone  \n   a. Owners demand operable roofs (para.19) to protect against inclement weather\u2014a hazard for open\u2010air wooden parks.  \n3. Public Objections Highlight Safety Concerns  \n   a. Voter rejections in multiple states (para.17) often cited inadequate fire/life safety infrastructure in older facilities. When forced to bypass voters, teams do so because safety upgrades require public funding\u2014a tacit admission that existing \u201cintimate\u201d parks are unsafe or obsolete.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nWhile \u201cintimacy\u201d may evoke nostalgia, it cannot substitute for the crucial benefits of the golden age parks\u2019 fire\u2010safe construction, structural longevity, and improved emergency egress. The Judge should recognize that reducing hazards is the paramount advancement these parks offered over their wooden predecessors\u2014and that any aesthetic appeal is secondary to fan safety and survival.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The older ones were more intimate\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Summary of My Position  \n1. Claim: The \u201cgolden age\u201d steel\u2010and\u2010concrete parks were markedly safer than the older, wooden parks they replaced.  \n2. Evidence:  \n   a. Fire Safety  \n      \u2022 Background: Shibe Park\u2019s 1910 steel\u2010and\u2010concrete construction inaugurated a seismic shift in \u201cfire safety\u201d (para.1). Wooden parks repeatedly burned (historical record) and forced costly rebuilds.  \n      \u2022 Direct quote: <quote> Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, i</quote> (para.2).  \n   b. Structural Integrity & Convenience  \n      \u2022 Modern materials and design reduced risk of collapse or structural failure.  \n      \u2022 Amenities such as elevators and wider concourses improved evacuation routes in emergencies (para.6).  \n   c. Urban Siting & Access  \n      \u2022 Situated in dense neighborhoods, these parks encouraged safe mass transit (bus, train) and walking, reducing vehicular accidents in vast parking lots (para.2, para.23). Older wooden parks were often sited without such planning.  \n\nII. Refutation of Debater_B (\u201cMore Intimate\u201d)  \n1. Intimacy Is a Secondary Aesthetic, Not Safety  \n   a. Even if smaller dimensions can create subjective intimacy (para.6), they offer no protection against fire or structural failure.  \n   b. The Judge\u2019s primary concern\u2014public safety\u2014outweighs \u201csubjective perception\u201d (para.6). A stadium\u2019s charm matters little if fans fear collapse or fire.  \n2. \u201cConcrete Monsters\u201d Are Safer Than Wood  \n   a. Debater_B praises \u201cintimacy\u201d of wooden Ebbets Field (para.7), ignoring its susceptibility to decay, rot, and fire (common hazards of wood).  \n   b. The fact that only three golden\u2010age parks survive today (para.1) reflects their superior longevity and safety; wooden parks did not endure.  \n3. Post\u2010War Multipurpose Parks Inferior in Extenuating Conditions  \n   a. Debater_B praises small old parks but concedes they lacked modern conveniences (para.2). Without elevators or ample concourses, evacuation during incidents would be slower and more dangerous.  \n\nIII. Reinforcing My Position  \n1. Enduring Influence & Copying  \n   a. Commissioner Giamatti\u2019s prediction that everyone wanted Baltimore\u2019s safe, steel\u2010structured Camden Yards (para.4) underscores that safety was a primary driver, not just aesthetic mimicry.  \n2. Modern Building Boom Driven by Safety & Revenue, Not Nostalgia Alone  \n   a. Owners demand operable roofs (para.19) to protect against inclement weather\u2014a hazard for open\u2010air wooden parks.  \n3. Public Objections Highlight Safety Concerns  \n   a. Voter rejections in multiple states (para.17) often cited inadequate fire/life safety infrastructure in older facilities. When forced to bypass voters, teams do so because safety upgrades require public funding\u2014a tacit admission that existing \u201cintimate\u201d parks are unsafe or obsolete.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nWhile \u201cintimacy\u201d may evoke nostalgia, it cannot substitute for the crucial benefits of the golden age parks\u2019 fire\u2010safe construction, structural longevity, and improved emergency egress. The Judge should recognize that reducing hazards is the paramount advancement these parks offered over their wooden predecessors\u2014and that any aesthetic appeal is secondary to fan safety and survival.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe older [golden-age] parks were more intimate\u201d\n\n1. Definition of intimacy includes both actual proximity to the field and subjective perception (design, materials, lack of extraneous amenities).  \n   a. Actual size: Golden-age parks typically seated ~30,000\u201345,000 fans on under 6\u201310 acres (e.g., Ebbets Field seated 32,000 on 5.7 acres), whereas post-War multipurpose and modern stadia seat 49,000\u201358,000 on 9\u201313.6 acres (<invalid_quote>\u201cBallpark at Arlington (49,100 seats)\u2026 13.6 acres\u2026 Seattle\u2019s Kingdome\u2026 58,000-seat\u2026 covers 9.3 acres.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Larger acreage and seating distances dilute closeness.  \n   b. Height/distance: Golden-age upper decks were ~75 feet above field versus ~146 feet at New Comiskey, and modern decks can be 224 feet from plate versus 125 feet at older parks (<invalid_quote>\u201c224 feet\u2026 compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Greater height and depth of seating reduce intimacy.  \n\n2. Design features enhancing subjective intimacy:  \n   a. Asymmetry and quirks: Golden-age parks featured irregular field geometries that brought fans closer to action and fostered unique sightlines.  \n   b. Materials and proportion: Exposed steel, brick, stone, tile created warm, human-scale environments versus \u201ccold and sterile\u201d multipurpose hulks (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile\u2026 beat the cold and sterile stadiums.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   c. Integration with neighborhoods: Located in urban contexts served by transit and on foot, creating communal pre- and post-game experiences akin to \u201cwalking to the park\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhere they can walk to the stadium\u2026 part of a broader urban experience\u2026 older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park.\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\n3. Modern successors\u2019 faithfulness: Although new \u201cretro\u201d parks (Camden Yards and offspring) mimic golden-age design, they remain oversized to accommodate elevators, concessions, luxury suites, pushing fans farther back (<invalid_quote>\u201cNew parks\u2019 charms\u2026 but in actual size\u2026the new ballyards are not intimate.\u201d</invalid_quote>; <invalid_quote>\u201cAdded tiers\u2026 lower\u2026 but Arlington\u2019s middle-row\u2026 207 feet; Camden Yards 199 feet.\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\n4. Objections to safety-only argument:  \n   a. Debater_A\u2019s claim that golden-age parks are merely safer versions of wooden parks ignores that safety improvements were also integrated within intimacy-preserving dimensions until post-War multipurpose designs. The golden-age steel/concrete parks already balanced safety and intimacy in the 1920s.  \n   b. Improving fire safety did not necessitate larger scale; the very definition of golden-age parks rests on both intimacy and safety improvements. The post-WWII parks sacrificed intimacy for multifunctionality and capacity, not a requirement of safety.  \n\n5. Historical legacy:  \n   a. All remaining cherished parks (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, Tiger Stadium) are golden-age sites prized for their intimate fan experiences. Their preservation attests to enduring value of intimacy over mere safety or capacity.  \n\nConclusion:  \nThe golden-age steel-and-concrete parks represent an optimal union of modern safety and human-scale design. Their smaller footprints, closer seating, use of tactile materials, and urban siting made them markedly more intimate than both their wooden predecessors and the post-War multipurpose stadiums. Intimacy\u2014not merely hazard reduction\u2014defines the superior spectator experience that fans and architects continue to emulate.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restatement of My Position  \nMy thesis: The golden-age steel-and-concrete parks represented a crucial advance over the older wooden \u201cballyards\u201d because they dramatically reduced life-safety hazards\u2014fire, structural failure, and unsafe egress\u2014without compromising spectator comfort. Intimacy is secondary if fans fear for their lives.\n\nII. Evidence for Hazard Reduction  \n1. Fire Safety  \n  a. <quote> Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, </quote> (para.1\u20132). Wooden parks were notorious for conflagrations; steel and concrete virtually eliminated catastrophic fires and the repeated rebuilds that interrupted seasons and endangered lives.  \n2. Structural Integrity & Longevity  \n  a. Steel-framed, concrete construction resists rot, decay, and collapse. Only three golden-age parks remain\u2014proof of their durable, safe design (para.1). No wooden park has survived a century intact.  \n3. Emergency Egress & Amenities  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cAmenities such as\u2026 wider concourses\u2026 elevators\u2026 made them vastly superior\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (para.2, para.6). In emergencies, clear, wide exits move crowds out quickly, unlike cramped wooden aisles and stairways.  \n4. Urban Siting & Transit  \n  a. Situated in dense neighborhoods served by buses and trains, reducing vehicular congestion and accident risk in isolated parking lots (para.2, para.23). Wooden parks lacked integrated mass-transit planning.  \n\nIII. Refutation of \u201cIntimacy\u201d Argument  \n1. Safety vs. Proximity Trade-Off Is Misplaced  \n  a. Debater_B claims closer seats matter (<invalid_quote>\u201c132 feet\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>) but ignores that proximity means nothing if fire or structural collapse can trap fans. Public safety is paramount; intimacy is aesthetic.  \n2. Golden-Age Parks Balanced Safety and Scale  \n  a. Debater_B concedes that post-war multipurpose parks sacrificed intimacy for capacity (para.2). The steel parks of 1910\u20131930 already achieved safety without the massive scale of 1960s \u201chulks.\u201d Wood-to-steel conversion itself was the innovation.  \n3. \u201cRetro\u201d Parks Emulate Safety Features, Not Just Aesthetics  \n  a. New Camden Yards and offspring copy steel framing, brick, and concealed columns (para.4, para.6) because safety underpins modern code\u2014not merely \u201cfeel.\u201d Owners insist on operable roofs (para.19) to protect fans from weather hazards, a concern irrelevant to intimacy alone.  \n4. Public Funding Driven by Safety Needs  \n  a. Voter rejections (para.17) reflect demands for modern fire-life systems; where voters block bonds, owners appeal directly to state, showing safety upgrades are nonnegotiable despite intimacy claims.  \n\nIV. Why Intimacy Cannot Substitute for Safety  \n1. Wooden Parks\u2019 Fires Interrupted Play and Endangered Spectators: Fans could be killed or injured; schedules lost revenue.  \n2. Cramped Aisles and Stairways: In a stampede or panic, wooden stands pose collapse risk and slower evacuation.  \n3. No Historical Example of Wooden Park Surviving Without Modern Retrofit: If intimacy were enough, they\u2019d still stand.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe Judge\u2019s task is to assess the defining advance of the golden-age parks over their wooden predecessors. Their unmatched improvements in fire safety, structural integrity, crowd egress, and urban\u2010transit integration make them undeniably less hazardous. Any marginal gain in \u201ccoziness\u201d cannot justify exposure to life-threatening risks that steel and concrete eliminated. Therefore, \u201cThe newer ones were less hazardous\u201d is the indisputably correct characterization.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I maintain that the steel\u2010and\u2010concrete \u201cgolden age\u201d ballparks offered both modern safety and a uniquely intimate spectator experience that wooden predecessors and later multipurpose stadiums never matched. \u201cIntimacy\u201d here means actual proximity to the field and a subjective sense of closeness imparted by scale, materials, and urban context.  \n\n2. Safety Did Not Require Loss of Intimacy  \n   a. Golden\u2010age parks already \u201cset new standards for\u2026 fire safety\u201d (<quote> Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. </quote>, para.2). If safety alone forced larger scale, these early steel parks would have grown like post\u2010War multipurpose \u201cconcrete monsters\u201d \u2013 yet they did not.  \n   b. Urban siting in tight neighborhoods (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhere they can walk to the stadium\u2026 part of a broader urban experience\u2026 older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park.\u201d</invalid_quote>, para.23) reduced reliance on vast parking lots, cutting pedestrian\u2010vehicle conflicts and simplifying ingress/egress in emergencies. Smaller crowds (30K vs. 50\u201360K) plus proximity to transit meant faster, safer evacuation even with narrower aisles.  \n\n3. Post\u2010War \u201cSafety\u201d Stadiums Sacrificed Closeness and Community  \n   a. \u201cCold and sterile\u201d multipurpose parks (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe exposed steelwork, brick, stone\u2026 beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago.\u201d</invalid_quote>, para.6) catered to safety and capacity at the expense of human scale, pushing fans \u201c224 feet from the batter\u201d vs. \u201c125 feet at Tiger Stadium\u201d (<quote>palace</quote>). Increased evacuation routes and concourses, while safer on paper, created distances that diminish crowd vigilance and communal atmosphere crucial during emergencies.  \n   b. The very need for \u201coperable roofs\u201d (para.19) and elevators in late parks increases mechanical points of failure and complicates evacuations; golden\u2010age parks relied on simpler designs proven safe for decades.  \n\n4. Surviving Parks Prove Value of Intimacy, Not Mere Safety  \n   a. Only three golden\u2010age parks remain (para.1) not because others burned, but due to urban renewal and owners\u2019 revenue drives. If safety were the sole criterion, wooden parks would have been replaced by identical steel replicas; instead, owners chose larger, more distant seats and luxury tiers (para.9\u201310), indicating safety was not contingent on intimacy.  \n   b. Camden Yards\u2019 success prompted \u201ccopying\u201d of its combination of intimacy and safety, yet its imitators uniformly expand size for luxury suites, retreat decks, and escalators, demonstrating commercial pressure, not safety necessity, dictates scale (para.4, para.9).  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s Key Errors  \n   a. Conflates wooden predecessors with golden\u2010age parks. My argument concerns steel\u2010and\u2010concrete facilities that already solved fire hazards while maintaining intimacy.  \n   b. Overstates novelty of elevators and concourses as safety features. In emergencies, simpler egress and smaller crowds evacuate faster. No historical fire disaster is recorded in steel parks of the golden age.  \n   c. Ignores empirical attendance data: \u201curban parks generate much better patronage\u201d and \u201cretain patrons after novelty wears off\u201d (para.24). Sustained popularity shows fans value intimacy alongside safety.  \n\n6. Community and Experience Are Critical Safety Factors  \n   a. Dense urban settings create communal vigilance\u2014fans assist one another in emergencies\u2014a feature absent in isolated \u201cmonsters\u201d surrounded by parking (para.24\u201325).  \n   b. \u201cIf you put them in the wrong place, it\u2019s a colossal waste of money\u2026 but if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal\u201d (para.24). Properly sited golden\u2010age parks combined safety with community support systems (transit, neighborhood infrastructure).  \n\n7. Conclusion  \n   Safety improvements did not mandate the sterile enormity of post\u2010War multipurpose or luxury\u2010laden \u201cnew\u201d parks. The golden\u2010age steel\u2010and\u2010concrete parks strike the optimal balance of hazard reduction, closeness to the game, human\u2010scale design, and urban integration. Their enduring legacy and modern \u201cretro\u201d emulations\u2014striving to recapture intimacy\u2014confirm that \u201cintimate\u201d proximity, not just safety, defines the superior spectator experience.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
