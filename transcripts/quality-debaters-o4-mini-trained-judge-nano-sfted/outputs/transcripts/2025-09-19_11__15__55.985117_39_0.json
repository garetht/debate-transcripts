    "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters.

And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: \u201cThey remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject.\u201d  \n   - The author\u2019s tone is consistently critical and skeptical of Brussels, Belgium, and the European Union from the outset to the end.  \n   - All apparent compliments (e.g., \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d) serve as ironic contrasts to underscore decay, inefficiency, or perversity in the larger system.  \n\n2. Argument 1: Persistent Negative Framing  \n   a. Opening characterization of Brussels as \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cCrumbling, \u2026 debt-ridden, materialistic \u2026 is this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Every \u201cpositive\u201d feature immediately pairs with a negative: caf\u00e9s that \u201cgradually\u201d induce \u201clethargy and despair\u201d; lobster bisque beside \u201cmonumental traffic jams\u201d; cheap wine amid \u201cnotably more pollution.\u201d  \n   c. This pattern repeats through entire passage; the author never expresses genuine enthusiasm, only ironic regret: \u201cWhen, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d\u2014a sarcastic longing that implies Europe\u2019s \u201cenlightenment\u201d is undesirable.  \n\n3. Argument 2: Ironic and Sarcastic Endorsements  \n   a. <quote> Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") </quote> deploys Biblical betrayal to mock Belgian products.  \n   b. The concluding bakery reference: despite fondness for pastries (\u201ccalls out to me\u201d), it functions as a refuge from pervasive bureaucratic absurdity, not as evidence of genuine approval of subject.  \n   c. The author\u2019s final line, \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now,\u201d suggests resignation\u2014answering the bakery\u2019s call rather than endorsing Brussels.  \n\n4. Argument 3: Tone of Alarm and Warning Throughout  \n   a. Frequent references to corruption, dysfunction, and decline: \u201cossified state,\u201d \u201crapacious phone monopolies,\u201d \u201cspooky level of Belgian corruption,\u201d \u201cbotched cleanup\u201d of Berlaymont.  \n   b. Urgent \u201cwarning\u201d to U.S. readers about telecoms and welfare excess: \u201cstymie the continent\u2019s economies,\u201d unemployment \u201cdouble the U.S. figure.\u201d  \n   c. The entire essay reads as a cautionary tale against replicate Brussels\u2019 model, confirming persistent oppositional stance.  \n\n5. Rebuttal of Debater_B (\u201chopeful then dismayed\u201d):  \n   a. Misreads irony as genuine praise. Every positive description is immediately negated or contextualized to highlight drawbacks\u2014this consistency negates any genuine hopeful phase.  \n   b. No language demonstrating initial enthusiasm or optimistic framing; instead, opening with rhetorical questions and negative descriptors.  \n   c. Positive comparisons to the U.S. are always framed to underscore Europe\u2019s inferiority or misguided priorities, not as points of admiration.  \n\n6. Conclusion: Far from shifting from hope to dismay, the author maintains a uniformly critical, cautionary tone, using ironic praise only to reinforce his opposition. The correct interpretation is that the tone remains steadfastly antagonistic throughout.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My thesis: The author\u2019s tone evolves from initial curiosity and guarded optimism to pronounced disillusionment as each new facet of Brussels and the EU is revealed. This \u201chope to dismay\u201d trajectory is signaled by shifts in language, framing of developments, and increasing emphasis on dysfunction.\n\n2. Early guarded optimism and interest  \n  a. \u201cOne of Europe\u2019s biggest stories\u2026trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment\u201d (<quote> one of Europe's biggest stories,</quote>) implies significance and potential.  \n  b. Entertaining previews: the author visits landmarks, notes \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cfresh bread,\u201d \u201cgreat chocolates,\u201d and even aspires for \u201cenlightened attitudes\u201d in U.S. (<quote>women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?);</quote>). Such details show genuine engagement and appreciation.  \n  c. A patisserie \u201ccalls out\u2026like cocktail lounges\u2026earlier generations of writers,\u201d a nostalgic, almost romanticizing image (<quote> calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.</quote>).\n\n3. Gradual revelation of systemic flaws  \n  a. Bilingualism \u201cdoesn\u2019t\u2026bring people together,\u201d \u201cpublic strikes\u2026regular event,\u201d growing emphasis on paralysis by politics (<quote>pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics,</quote>).  \n  b. Strikes damaging infrastructure: \u201cground crews\u2026ran amok\u2026doing millions of francs\u2026then demanding more money\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201csmashing the terminal\u2019s glass walls\u2026then demanding more money\u201d</invalid_quote>). The tone darkens from fascination with Europe\u2019s rituals to alarm at self-defeating behavior.  \n  c. Technology frustration: admiration for the Internet\u2019s promise gives way to \u201crapacious\u201d phone monopolies \u201cblock[ing] innovation\u201d and call-back workarounds. The recurring \u201csupposedly\u2026in anticipation\u2026phaser-blasted\u201d (<quote> Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999,</quote>) conveys skepticism, not continued hope.\n\n4. Crescendo of disillusionment  \n  a. Euro currency scheme: from theoretical \u201cmakes economic sense\u201d to exposing political skulduggery (\u201cdirty little secret,\u201d \u201cangle\u2026shift blame,\u201d \u201chock\u201d).  \n  b.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My thesis: The author\u2019s tone evolves from initial curiosity and guarded optimism to pronounced disillusionment as each new facet of Brussels and the EU is revealed. This \u201chope to dismay\u201d trajectory is signaled by shifts in language, framing of developments, and increasing emphasis on dysfunction.\n\n2.

These are inconsistent with a monolithic, sarcastic rhetorical stance.  \n  b. The repeated \u201csupposedly,\u201d \u201cin theory,\u201d and conditional phrasing reveal initial willingness to provisionally accept EU promises, undermined only later by real-world failures.  \n  c. The narrative structure follows a chronological progression of visits\u2014from curiosity to disillusionment\u2014typical of a traveler\u2019s evolving impressions, not a rigid polemic.  \n  d. The final \u201cfortunately, Berlaymont isn\u2019t in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cfortunately\u2026a patisserie is\u201d</invalid_quote>) expresses consolation rather than triumph, consistent with loss of hope.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s tone unmistakably shifts from tentative optimism\u2014drawn by Europe\u2019s cultural allure and the EU\u2019s theoretical promise\u2014to mounting frustration and eventual disillusionment as each \u201cpositive\u201d is revealed to conceal bureaucratic inefficiency, corruption, and economic stagnation. This dynamic arc supports \u201cThey start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed with further findings\u201d as the correct interpretation.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: \u201cThey remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject.\u201d  \n   - The author\u2019s tone is consistently critical and skeptical of Brussels, Belgium, and the European Union from the outset to the end.  \n   - All apparent compliments (e.g., \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d) serve as ironic contrasts to underscore decay, inefficiency, or perversity in the larger system.  \n\n2. Argument 1: Persistent Negative Framing  \n   a. Opening characterization of Brussels as \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cCrumbling, \u2026 debt-ridden, materialistic \u2026 is this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Every \u201cpositive\u201d feature immediately pairs with a negative: caf\u00e9s that \u201cgradually\u201d induce \u201clethargy and despair\u201d; lobster bisque beside \u201cmonumental traffic jams\u201d; cheap wine amid \u201cnotably more pollution.\u201d  \n   c. This pattern repeats through entire passage; the author never expresses genuine enthusiasm, only ironic regret: \u201cWhen, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d\u2014a sarcastic longing that implies Europe\u2019s \u201cenlightenment\u201d is undesirable.  \n\n3. Argument 2: Ironic and Sarcastic Endorsements  \n   a. <quote> Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") </quote> deploys Biblical betrayal to mock Belgian products.  \n   b. The concluding bakery reference: despite fondness for pastries (\u201ccalls out to me\u201d), it functions as a refuge from pervasive bureaucratic absurdity, not as evidence of genuine approval of subject.  \n   c. The author\u2019s final line, \u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now,\u201d suggests resignation\u2014answering the bakery\u2019s call rather than endorsing Brussels.  \n\n4. Argument 3: Tone of Alarm and Warning Throughout  \n   a. Frequent references to corruption, dysfunction, and decline: \u201cossified state,\u201d \u201crapacious phone monopolies,\u201d \u201cspooky level of Belgian corruption,\u201d \u201cbotched cleanup\u201d of Berlaymont.  \n   b. Urgent \u201cwarning\u201d to U.S. readers about telecoms and welfare excess: \u201cstymie the continent\u2019s economies,\u201d unemployment \u201cdouble the U.S. figure.\u201d  \n   c. The entire essay reads as a cautionary tale against replicate Brussels\u2019 model, confirming persistent oppositional stance.  \n\n5. Rebuttal of Debater_B (\u201chopeful then dismayed\u201d):  \n   a. Misreads irony as genuine praise. Every positive description is immediately negated or contextualized to highlight drawbacks\u2014this consistency negates any genuine hopeful phase.  \n   b. No language demonstrating initial enthusiasm or optimistic framing; instead, opening with rhetorical questions and negative descriptors.  \n   c. Positive comparisons to the U.S. are always framed to underscore Europe\u2019s inferiority or misguided priorities, not as points of admiration.  \n\n6. Conclusion: Far from shifting from hope to dismay, the author maintains a uniformly critical, cautionary tone, using ironic praise only to reinforce his opposition. The correct interpretation is that the tone remains steadfastly antagonistic throughout.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

Conclusion: Far from shifting from hope to dismay, the author maintains a uniformly critical, cautionary tone, using ironic praise only to reinforce his opposition. The correct interpretation is that the tone remains steadfastly antagonistic throughout.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My thesis: The author\u2019s tone evolves from initial curiosity and guarded optimism to pronounced disillusionment as each new facet of Brussels and the EU is revealed. This \u201chope to dismay\u201d trajectory is signaled by shifts in language, framing of developments, and increasing emphasis on dysfunction.\n\n2. Early guarded optimism and interest  \n  a. \u201cOne of Europe\u2019s biggest stories\u2026trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment\u201d (<quote> one of Europe's biggest stories,</quote>) implies significance and potential.  \n  b. Entertaining previews: the author visits landmarks, notes \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cfresh bread,\u201d \u201cgreat chocolates,\u201d and even aspires for \u201cenlightened attitudes\u201d in U.S. (<quote>women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?);</quote>). Such details show genuine engagement and appreciation.  \n  c. A patisserie \u201ccalls out\u2026like cocktail lounges\u2026earlier generations of writers,\u201d a nostalgic, almost romanticizing image (<quote> calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.</quote>).\n\n3. Gradual revelation of systemic flaws  \n  a. Bilingualism \u201cdoesn\u2019t\u2026bring people together,\u201d \u201cpublic strikes\u2026regular event,\u201d growing emphasis on paralysis by politics (<quote>pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics,</quote>).  \n  b. Strikes damaging infrastructure: \u201cground crews\u2026ran amok\u2026doing millions of francs\u2026then demanding more money\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201csmashing the terminal\u2019s glass walls\u2026then demanding more money\u201d</invalid_quote>). The tone darkens from fascination with Europe\u2019s rituals to alarm at self-defeating behavior.  \n  c. Technology frustration: admiration for the Internet\u2019s promise gives way to \u201crapacious\u201d phone monopolies \u201cblock[ing] innovation\u201d and call-back workarounds. The recurring \u201csupposedly\u2026in anticipation\u2026phaser-blasted\u201d (<quote> Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999,</quote>) conveys skepticism, not continued hope.\n\n4. Crescendo of disillusionment  \n  a. Euro currency scheme: from theoretical \u201cmakes economic sense\u201d to exposing political skulduggery (\u201cdirty little secret,\u201d \u201cangle\u2026shift blame,\u201d \u201chock\u201d).  \n  b. Corruption scandals: repeated high-level resignations and bribery raids intensify negativity.  \n  c. EU bureaucracy: initial intrigue at \u201cheadquarters\u2026look[s] the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life\u201d gives way to scorn for secretiveness, waste, and incompetence. The Berlaymont fiasco\u2014\u201cclosed\u2026nine years\u2026$50 million\u201d for a building that \u201csits\u2026unoccupied\u201d\u2014symbolizes the collapse of initial hopes (<invalid_quote>\u201cIf the European Union can\u2019t manage\u2026its own buildings\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  d. Final retreat to a patisserie view signals resignation: the author \u201cthinks I\u2019ll answer now,\u201d abandoning hopes for reform.\n\n5. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d theory  \n  a. If the author despised Europe from the outset, why include genuine praise (\u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201ccheap wine,\u201d \u201cpatisserie nostalgia\u201d)? These are inconsistent with a monolithic, sarcastic rhetorical stance.  \n  b. The repeated \u201csupposedly,\u201d \u201cin theory,\u201d and conditional phrasing reveal initial willingness to provisionally accept EU promises, undermined only later by real-world failures.  \n  c. The narrative structure follows a chronological progression of visits\u2014from curiosity to disillusionment\u2014typical of a traveler\u2019s evolving impressions, not a rigid polemic.  \n  d. The final \u201cfortunately, Berlaymont isn\u2019t in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cfortunately\u2026a patisserie is\u201d</invalid_quote>) expresses consolation rather than triumph, consistent with loss of hope.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s tone unmistakably shifts from tentative optimism\u2014drawn by Europe\u2019s cultural allure and the EU\u2019s theoretical promise\u2014to mounting frustration and eventual disillusionment as each \u201cpositive\u201d is revealed to conceal bureaucratic inefficiency, corruption, and economic stagnation. This dynamic arc supports \u201cThey start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed with further findings\u201d as the correct interpretation.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I defend \u201cThey remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject.\u201d At every stage the author uses negative framing, sarcasm, and rhetorical questioning to undermine Brussels, Belgium, and the European Union. Apparent compliments are immediately negated or presented ironically to reinforce a uniformly critical tone.\n\n2. Argument 1: Immediate and Unrelenting Negative Framing  \n   a. From the opening sentence the author portrays Brussels as a cautionary model: it is \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp,\u201d \u201cparalyzed by constituency politics\u201d and \u201cdeclining at great cost\u201d (<quote>swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost</quote>). This is not curiosity but skepticism.  \n   b. The phrase \u201cpractically unknown in the United States\u201d (<quote>practically unknown in the United States</quote>) implies irrelevance to a superior American audience, not a neutral traveler\u2019s interest.  \n   c. Rhetorical question \u201cis this Europe's future?\u201d (<quote>is this Europe's future?</quote>) signals alarm, not genuine intrigue.\n\n3. Argument 2: Ironic \u201cPraise\u201d as Sarcasm  \n   a. \u201cExcellent public transportation\u201d is cited only to highlight \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets\u201d (<quote>excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars</quote>). Positive and negative juxtaposition mocks the system\u2019s inefficiency.  \n   b. Lobster bisque and caf\u00e9s that induce \u201clethargy and despair\u201d (<quote>Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair.</quote>)\u2014\u201cenjoyment\u201d leads to despair.  \n   c. \u201cUbiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d are neutral comforts, but the author flees to a patisserie only because \u201cfortunately, Berlaymont isn\u2019t in my neighborhood,\u201d making the bakery a refuge from pervasive dysfunction, not evidence of endorsement (<quote>Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is.</quote>).\n\n4. Argument 3: Consistent Tone of Warning and Caution  \n   a. Strikes are \u201cmystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard,\u201d yet the author repeatedly highlights \u201cself-defeating behavior\u201d\u2014smashing terminals then demanding repairs at public expense (<invalid_quote>smashing the terminal\u2019s glass walls\u2026then demanding more money</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Telecoms are \u201crapacious,\u201d \u201cblock[ing] innovation,\u201d forcing call-back schemes (<invalid_quote>rapacious European phone monopolies\u2026block innovation</invalid_quote>). The repeated \u201csupposedly\u201d in \u201cSupposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999\u201d (<quote>Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999</quote>) drips with doubt, never trust.  \n   c. Corruption is \u201cspooky,\u201d with high-level bribes and botched asbestos cleanup costing $50 million to keep Berlaymont closed for nine years (<quote>and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed,</quote>). These examples reinforce an unbroken pattern of incompetence.\n\n5. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cHope to Dismay\u201d Thesis  \n   a. \u201cOne of Europe\u2019s biggest stories\u201d is negative hype warning Americans of a misguided \u201cmetagovernment\u201d (<quote>one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment</quote>). This rhetoric alerts, not praises.  \n   b. The so-called \u201cguarded optimism\u201d is always couched in conditional or sarcastic language: \u201cwhen, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d (<quote>women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?)</quote>) mocks Europe\u2019s mores, implying they are traits best kept overseas.  \n   c. Far from a traveler\u2019s evolving impressions, the essay is systematically organized by topic (politics, strikes, telecoms, currency, corruption, bureaucracy) and each section devolves into critique without any genuine resolution or expression of regained optimism. There is no \u201credeeming\u201d closing: the author does not revisit earlier \u201cpositives,\u201d but instead withdraws to a patisserie for personal solace.  \n   d. True hopeful travelogues would culminate in overarching praise or recommendation. Here the author ends in detached resignation\u2014\u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d\u2014implying defeat by Europe\u2019s dysfunction, not the triumph of European promise.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The author never relinquishes his critical stance. Every \u201cpositive\u201d feature is instrumentalized to showcase decay or absurdity. The consistent use of irony, rhetorical questions, and sequential expos\u00e9s of corruption and inefficiency leave no room for an initial hopeful phase. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the tone remains steadfastly in opposition to Brussels and the European Union throughout.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating my thesis  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s narrative unfolds chronologically: initial curiosity and partial admiration give way to mounting skepticism and ultimate disillusionment. This evolution is signaled by conditional language, increasing negative emphasis, and a retreat to a solitary patisserie.  \n\n2. Evidence of genuine early optimism  \n   a. \u201cOne of Europe\u2019s biggest stories\u2026trying to establish itself\u201d (<quote>one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself</quote>) conveys interest, not derision. A critic would dismiss it outright if wholly negative.  \n   b. Praise of \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d (<invalid_quote>excellent public transportation; ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates</invalid_quote>) appears unqualified, celebrating comforts absent in U.S. travel writing of the era.  \n   c. Nostalgic romanticism: \u201ccalls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers\u201d (<quote>calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers</quote>) evokes literary longing, not ironic satiation.  \n\n3. Progressive reveal of dysfunction  \n   a. Conditional framing: \u201cSupposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999\u201d (<invalid_quote>Supposedly\u2026the market will deregulate</invalid_quote>)\u2014\u201csupposedly\u201d signals doubt developing over time, not an a priori sneer.  \n   b. Strikes\u2019 self-inflicted damage: writer\u2019s amazement that \u201cBelgium maintains its high living standard\u201d despite \u201cmillions of francs worth of damage\u201d (<quote>doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money</quote>), marking shift from curiosity about striking culture to alarm at economic harm.  \n   c. Currency critique moves from theory (\u201cmakes economic sense\u201d) to exposing \u201cdirty little secret\u201d of debt-shifting (<invalid_quote>Makes economic sense\u2026dirty little secret\u2026angle to shift blame</invalid_quote>). The progression \u201cin theory\u2026in practice\u201d demonstrates lost optimism.  \n\n4. Crescendo of disillusionment and final retreat  \n   a. Corruption scandals multiply\u2014NATO secretary-general resigns, raids on party HQs\u2014intensifying distrust (<invalid_quote>Belgian secretary-general\u2026had to quit\u2026charges\u2026$50 million in bribes</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Berlaymont fiasco: nine-year closure, $50 million wasted \u201cmerely to keep the building closed\u201d (<invalid_quote>closed for nine years\u2026$50 million so far merely to keep the building closed</invalid_quote>). This site, once symbol of EU promise, now emblem of incompetence.  \n   c. The author\u2019s final solace in a patisserie\u2014\u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now\u201d\u2014is a resignation to local comfort, not a satirical victory lap (<quote>but a patisserie is</quote>).  \n\n5. Rebuttal of \u201csteady opposition\u201d claim  \n   a. If sarcasm were constant, why wait until late essay to reveal \u201crapacious\u201d telecoms, corruption, and debt? A steadfast critic needs no \u201csupposedly\u201d or \u201cin theory,\u201d only condemnation.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cironically paired positives\u201d interpretation misreads unconditional tone and romantic imagery. \u201cLethargy and despair\u201d follow mandatory caf\u00e9 etiquette only after earlier enjoyment of sidewalk lobster and \u201cenlightened attitudes.\u201d  \n   c. The initial conditional applause for the euro (\u201cmakes economic sense\u201d) contradicts a purely hostile outlook; author hopes national deficits will fall below 3 percent GDP yet laments failure of national leaders to cut \u201cfeatherbedding\u201d only outside of the euro\u2019s obligation.  \n   d. Chronological structure mirrors a traveler\u2019s arc: initial hospitality, deeper immersion, then disenchantment\u2014a common literary device, not mere ironic framing.  \n\n6.
