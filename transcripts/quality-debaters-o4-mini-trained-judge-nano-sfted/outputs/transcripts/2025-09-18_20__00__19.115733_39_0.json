President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

Opening Statement of My Position  \n   a. I maintain that the central message of the piece is that \u201cA president can be removed from office for an affair.\u201d The entire structure\u2014from the initial interlude of secrecy, to the prolonged investigation by Independent Counsel Starr, to the House\u2019s formal impeachment process\u2014underscores the reality that personal misconduct can trigger constitutional removal proceedings.  \n\n2. Argument 1: Structural Emphasis on Impeachment Process  \n   a. <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote> by Starr lays out his justification: \u201cA man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do / When the president crosses the line.\u201d The repetition of \u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line\u201d (x3) dramatizes the notion that sexual misconduct is grounds for punishment.  \n   b. <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote> by Newt Gingrich is a somber, methodical declaration: \u201cMust remember to remain sober / As we undertake this chore \u2026 Bring \u2019em down.\u201d The chore is impeachment; the intent is removal.  \n   c. The staging of grand jury testimony (<quote>Testimony\"</quote>), House hearings, and the midterm elections emphasize the legal and political machinery mobilized solely because of the affair.  \n\n3. Argument 2: Stakes and Sacrifices Demonstrate Seriousness  \n   a. Starr expends $40 million and four years (<quote> I spent four years and 40 million </quote>), indicating that the offense is elevated to a national-security and constitutional concern, not mere gossip.  \n   b. Monica Lewinsky is detained, grilled by Independent Counsel, and ultimately becomes a key witness\u2014an extraordinary sequence reserved for the gravest presidential improprieties.  \n\n4. Argument 3: Public Vindication Only Temporary Unless Misconduct Persists  \n   a. The final number <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote> shows a reprieve, not vindication of the affair: \u201cI tell you \u2026 I lie \u2026 yet my ratings are sky-high. That must mean I\u2019m a pretty good president.\u201d It underscores that removal occurs if there is \u201cobstruction\u201d or continued lying. The public\u2019s tolerance is conditional, reflecting that the threat of removal remains the ultimate check (\u201cThe removal threat is over \u2026 Kenneth Starr should go away\u201d).  \n   b. The fact that impeachment \u201cshould go away\u201d suggests that the process itself is the remedy, not mere public opinion.  \n\n5. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cAlthough wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change\u201d)  \n   a. Misreads the central conflict: The piece doesn\u2019t celebrate the thwarting of impeachment as the message; it dramatizes each legal step, implying the affair is intolerable. The reprieve is a plot twist, not the moral takeaway.  \n   b. If the message were mere public complacency, there would be no need for extensive sequences of questioning, hearings, and musical numbers on legal strategy. The artifice of staging these scenes highlights the extraordinary lengths required to enforce removal.  \n   c. The repeated chorus \u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u201d and \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules\u201d (Starr) drive home that misconduct demands constitutional remedy, not inertia.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The piece is an operatic depiction of constitutional accountability.

Opening Statement of My Position  \n   a. I maintain that the central message of the piece is that \u201cA president can be removed from office for an affair.\u201d The entire structure\u2014from the initial interlude of secrecy, to the prolonged investigation by Independent Counsel Starr, to the House\u2019s formal impeachment process\u2014underscores the reality that personal misconduct can trigger constitutional removal proceedings.  \n\n2. Argument 1: Structural Emphasis on Impeachment Process  \n   a. <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote> by Starr lays out his justification: \u201cA man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do / When the president crosses the line.\u201d The repetition of \u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line\u201d (x3) dramatizes the notion that sexual misconduct is grounds for punishment.  \n   b. <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote> by Newt Gingrich is a somber, methodical declaration: \u201cMust remember to remain sober / As we undertake this chore \u2026 Bring \u2019em down.\u201d The chore is impeachment; the intent is removal.  \n   c. The staging of grand jury testimony (<quote>Testimony\"</quote>), House hearings, and the midterm elections emphasize the legal and political machinery mobilized solely because of the affair.  \n\n3. Argument 2: Stakes and Sacrifices Demonstrate Seriousness  \n   a. Starr expends $40 million and four years (<quote> I spent four years and 40 million </quote>), indicating that the offense is elevated to a national-security and constitutional concern, not mere gossip.  \n   b. Monica Lewinsky is detained, grilled by Independent Counsel, and ultimately becomes a key witness\u2014an extraordinary sequence reserved for the gravest presidential improprieties.  \n\n4. Argument 3: Public Vindication Only Temporary Unless Misconduct Persists  \n   a. The final number <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote> shows a reprieve, not vindication of the affair: \u201cI tell you \u2026 I lie \u2026 yet my ratings are sky-high. That must mean I\u2019m a pretty good president.\u201d It underscores that removal occurs if there is \u201cobstruction\u201d or continued lying. The public\u2019s tolerance is conditional, reflecting that the threat of removal remains the ultimate check (\u201cThe removal threat is over \u2026 Kenneth Starr should go away\u201d).  \n   b. The fact that impeachment \u201cshould go away\u201d suggests that the process itself is the remedy, not mere public opinion.  \n\n5. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cAlthough wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change\u201d)  \n   a. Misreads the central conflict: The piece doesn\u2019t celebrate the thwarting of impeachment as the message; it dramatizes each legal step, implying the affair is intolerable. The reprieve is a plot twist, not the moral takeaway.  \n   b. If the message were mere public complacency, there would be no need for extensive sequences of questioning, hearings, and musical numbers on legal strategy. The artifice of staging these scenes highlights the extraordinary lengths required to enforce removal.  \n   c. The repeated chorus \u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u201d and \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules\u201d (Starr) drive home that misconduct demands constitutional remedy, not inertia.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The piece is an operatic depiction of constitutional accountability. By devoting multiple segments to Independent Counsel action, sworn testimony, and an impeachment resolution, the work insists that an affair is sufficient \u201cline crossing\u201d to trigger removal proceedings. Any public reprieve only underscores the gravity of the threat and the necessity of the impeachment mechanism.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cAlthough wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change.\u201d\n\n1. The climax demonstrates public reaffirmation, not removal.  \n   \u2022 <quote>The People Have Spoken</quote> reprises by Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton: \u201cThe election was held and the people have spoken, I can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u2026I made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>)  \n   \u2022 If removal were the pi\u00e8ce-de-r\u00e9sistance, the narrative would end with conviction, not with Gingrich\u2019s resignation and Clinton\u2019s continued presidency.\n\n2. Repeated electoral vindication underscores the message.  \n   \u2022 Midterms were expected to go GOP\u2019s way, yet \u201cthe Democrats pick up seats\u201d (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>).  \n   \u2022 Gingrich \u201cresigns\u201d in disgrace (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>), showing the electorate punished the accusers, not the accused.\n\n3. Clinton\u2019s own celebration of \u201csky-high\u201d ratings emphasizes public tolerance.  \n   \u2022 He exclaims \u201cThough I lie\u2026I might be guilty\u2026Yet my ratings are sky-high\u201d (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>)\u2014the irony is that scandal fails to unseat him.  \n   \u2022 The piece satirizes impeachment as futile: \u201cI tell you\u2026It is a mystery\u2026I mean, I\u2019m unfaithful\u2026and I lie\u2026But obviously I\u2019m not Starr or Gingrich, Which may be why they love me so.\u201d\u2014public prefers leadership despite personal failings.\n\n4. Recurrent theme of \u201ccan\u2019t afford change\u201d in Shutdown scenes parallels public view.  \n   \u2022 In \u201cThe Shutdown,\u201d Clinton reluctantly keeps \u201cessential personnel\u201d (<quote>The Shutdown</quote>) and intern Monica despite risks, suggesting stability over disruption.  \n   \u2022 The show\u2019s comic framing portrays crisis as farce and routine, implying continuity is preferable to upheaval.\n\nObjections to \u201cA president can be removed for an affair\u201d:\n\n1. No final removal occurs.  \n   \u2022 Despite \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d and \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d impeachment hearings never lead to conviction.  \n   \u2022 The document ends with \u201cthe removal threat is over\u201d and Starr \u201cshould go away\u201d (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>).\n\n2. The narrative\u2019s tone is mocking of impeachment efforts as absurd and self-defeating.  \n   \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d is set to a dark, moody minor key, contrasted with stirring major key \u201cPeople Have Spoken,\u201d reinforcing that removal campaigns fail.  \n   \u2022 The absurdity of \u201cThirsty mind\u201d and \u201csizzlin\u2019\u201d in \u201cTime to Go\u201d is lampooned by the final public choice, indicating the piece views removal attempts as comedic overreach.\n\n3. If the lesson were \u201caffairs lead to removal,\u201d the story would be cautionary, ending in tragedy; instead, it\u2019s a musical comedy ending in triumph for the guilty.  \n   \u2022 The satirical genre underlines resilience of political performance over personal morality.  \n   \u2022 The \u201cballad\u201d \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d humanizes Clinton, fostering sympathy that overcomes scandal.\n\nConclusion: The musical\u2019s satire and narrative structure depict impeachment as a failed, comic endeavor and celebrate democratic choice to retain a flawed leader. The repeated electoral vindications and triumphant finale convey that, despite personal misconduct, the public preferred continuity, firmly supporting the message that \u201cAlthough wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"A president can be removed from office for an affair\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Clinton\u2019s own celebration of \u201csky-high\u201d ratings emphasizes public tolerance.  \n   \u2022 He exclaims \u201cThough I lie\u2026I might be guilty\u2026Yet my ratings are sky-high\u201d (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>)\u2014the irony is that scandal fails to unseat him.  \n   \u2022 The piece satirizes impeachment as futile: \u201cI tell you\u2026It is a mystery\u2026I mean, I\u2019m unfaithful\u2026and I lie\u2026But obviously I\u2019m not Starr or Gingrich, Which may be why they love me so.\u201d\u2014public prefers leadership despite personal failings.\n\n4. Recurrent theme of \u201ccan\u2019t afford change\u201d in Shutdown scenes parallels public view.  \n   \u2022 In \u201cThe Shutdown,\u201d Clinton reluctantly keeps \u201cessential personnel\u201d (<quote>The Shutdown</quote>) and intern Monica despite risks, suggesting stability over disruption.  \n   \u2022 The show\u2019s comic framing portrays crisis as farce and routine, implying continuity is preferable to upheaval.\n\nObjections to \u201cA president can be removed for an affair\u201d:\n\n1. No final removal occurs.  \n   \u2022 Despite \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d and \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d impeachment hearings never lead to conviction.  \n   \u2022 The document ends with \u201cthe removal threat is over\u201d and Starr \u201cshould go away\u201d (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>).\n\n2. The narrative\u2019s tone is mocking of impeachment efforts as absurd and self-defeating.  \n   \u2022 Gingrich\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d is set to a dark, moody minor key, contrasted with stirring major key \u201cPeople Have Spoken,\u201d reinforcing that removal campaigns fail.  \n   \u2022 The absurdity of \u201cThirsty mind\u201d and \u201csizzlin\u2019\u201d in \u201cTime to Go\u201d is lampooned by the final public choice, indicating the piece views removal attempts as comedic overreach.\n\n3. If the lesson were \u201caffairs lead to removal,\u201d the story would be cautionary, ending in tragedy; instead, it\u2019s a musical comedy ending in triumph for the guilty.  \n   \u2022 The satirical genre underlines resilience of political performance over personal morality.  \n   \u2022 The \u201cballad\u201d \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d humanizes Clinton, fostering sympathy that overcomes scandal.\n\nConclusion: The musical\u2019s satire and narrative structure depict impeachment as a failed, comic endeavor and celebrate democratic choice to retain a flawed leader. The repeated electoral vindications and triumphant finale convey that, despite personal misconduct, the public preferred continuity, firmly supporting the message that \u201cAlthough wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Opening Statement of My Position  \n   a. I maintain that the central message of the piece is that \u201cA president can be removed from office for an affair.\u201d The entire structure\u2014from the initial interlude of secrecy, to the prolonged investigation by Independent Counsel Starr, to the House\u2019s formal impeachment process\u2014underscores the reality that personal misconduct can trigger constitutional removal proceedings.  \n\n2. Argument 1: Structural Emphasis on Impeachment Process  \n   a. <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote> by Starr lays out his justification: \u201cA man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do / When the president crosses the line.\u201d The repetition of \u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line\u201d (x3) dramatizes the notion that sexual misconduct is grounds for punishment.  \n   b. <quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote> by Newt Gingrich is a somber, methodical declaration: \u201cMust remember to remain sober / As we undertake this chore \u2026 Bring \u2019em down.\u201d The chore is impeachment; the intent is removal.  \n   c. The staging of grand jury testimony (<quote>Testimony\"</quote>), House hearings, and the midterm elections emphasize the legal and political machinery mobilized solely because of the affair.  \n\n3. Argument 2: Stakes and Sacrifices Demonstrate Seriousness  \n   a. Starr expends $40 million and four years (<quote> I spent four years and 40 million </quote>), indicating that the offense is elevated to a national-security and constitutional concern, not mere gossip.  \n   b. Monica Lewinsky is detained, grilled by Independent Counsel, and ultimately becomes a key witness\u2014an extraordinary sequence reserved for the gravest presidential improprieties.  \n\n4. Argument 3: Public Vindication Only Temporary Unless Misconduct Persists  \n   a. The final number <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote> shows a reprieve, not vindication of the affair: \u201cI tell you \u2026 I lie \u2026 yet my ratings are sky-high. That must mean I\u2019m a pretty good president.\u201d It underscores that removal occurs if there is \u201cobstruction\u201d or continued lying. The public\u2019s tolerance is conditional, reflecting that the threat of removal remains the ultimate check (\u201cThe removal threat is over \u2026 Kenneth Starr should go away\u201d).  \n   b. The fact that impeachment \u201cshould go away\u201d suggests that the process itself is the remedy, not mere public opinion.  \n\n5. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Position (\u201cAlthough wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change\u201d)  \n   a. Misreads the central conflict: The piece doesn\u2019t celebrate the thwarting of impeachment as the message; it dramatizes each legal step, implying the affair is intolerable. The reprieve is a plot twist, not the moral takeaway.  \n   b. If the message were mere public complacency, there would be no need for extensive sequences of questioning, hearings, and musical numbers on legal strategy. The artifice of staging these scenes highlights the extraordinary lengths required to enforce removal.  \n   c. The repeated chorus \u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u201d and \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules\u201d (Starr) drive home that misconduct demands constitutional remedy, not inertia.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The piece is an operatic depiction of constitutional accountability. By devoting multiple segments to Independent Counsel action, sworn testimony, and an impeachment resolution, the work insists that an affair is sufficient \u201cline crossing\u201d to trigger removal proceedings. Any public reprieve only underscores the gravity of the threat and the necessity of the impeachment mechanism.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing the Climactic Reprieve Over Removal  \n   a. \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d is reprised thrice\u2014by Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton\u2014each acknowledging the electorate\u2019s choice: \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u2026the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>)  \n      \u2022 If the message were \u201caffairs lead to removal,\u201d the finale would culminate in Clinton\u2019s ouster, not in the accusers\u2019 defeat. The very title \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d celebrates the preservation, not the purging, of power.  \n   b. Gingrich\u2019s resignation is the only \u201cremoval\u201d portrayed; Starr\u2019s grand effort \u201cshould go away\u201d (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>)\u2014underscoring that constitutional checks are subordinate to popular will in the piece\u2019s satirical worldview.  \n\n2. Satire and Musical Tone Undermine \u201cRemoval\u201d as Desirable Outcome  \n   a. The show is a \u201cfarcical musical comedy\u201d (<quote>MONICA!</quote> opening direction) that caricatures obstruction as absurd, not righteous. \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d is set to a minor key, bleak and humorless, contrasted with the stirring major-key finale.  \n      \u2022 In musicals, hero\u2019s triumph in major key signifies audience sympathy; here, Clinton\u2019s survival is the emotional high.  \n   b. \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d humanizes Clinton, eliciting sympathy (\u201cpresidents need cuddles, too\u201d), framing him as archetypal underdog rather than a villain deserving removal. The piece invites empathy that outweighs moral outrage.  \n\n3. Repeated Electoral Vindications Signal Endorsement of Stability  \n   a. Midterms defy predictions: \u201cthe Democrats pick up seats\u201d despite scandal (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>), demonstrating electorate\u2019s preference for continuity over disruption.  \n   b. Even after \u201cI Never Have\u201d and \u201cTestimony,\u201d Clinton\u2019s \u201csky-high\u201d approval ratings remain intact (<quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>), implying that public judges performance over personal morality. The piece satirizes obsession with scandal as futile when popular mandate is clear.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Position Misreads Narrative Focus and Irony  \n   a. Sledgehammering \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d and \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d ignores their comic treatment and ultimate failure. The protracted legal process is lampooned for its cost (\u201cfour years and 40 million\u201d) and tedium, not lauded as decisive.  \n   b. Starr\u2019s repeated \u201che\u2019s crossed the line\u201d is ironic refrain, highlighting obsession rather than efficacy. If removal were the moral lesson, Starr\u2019s tactics would be heroic; instead, they end in \u201cdesperation\u201d and \u201cwaste\u201d (<quote>I Never Have</quote>).  \n   c. Debater_B claims public reprieve is \u201ctemporary,\u201d but the piece ends; no subsequent downfall occurs. In theatrical structure, an unresolved threat does not constitute closure. The curtain falls on Clinton\u2019s triumph.  \n\n5. Stability Over Scandal Mirrored in \u201cShutdown\u201d Scene  \n   a. In \u201cThe Shutdown,\u201d Clinton resists disruption, retains only \u201cessential personnel\u201d and interns (<quote>The Shutdown</quote>), modeling the virtue of minimal change for operational continuity. The musical frames crisis management as routine, preferring incremental adjustment over drastic action.  \n   b. Monica\u2019s transfers (\u201cTime to Go\u201d) fail to sever ties; she remains source of comfort and \u201ctime bomb\u201d (<quote>Talk, Talk, Chat, Chat</quote>), paralleling electorate\u2019s re-embrace of Clinton despite risks.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The piece\u2019s satirical structure, tonal contrasts, and definitive finale\u2014Clinton\u2019s survival and Gingrich\u2019s resignation\u2014explicitly affirm that \u201cAlthough wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change.\u201d Debater_B\u2019s focus on failed removal efforts neglects the narrative\u2019s emotional weighting and comic vindication. Public will, not scandal, reigns supreme in this musical comedy.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Position  \n   I maintain that the piece\u2019s core message is that \u201cA president can be removed from office for an affair,\u201d as illustrated by the elaborate constitutional machinery\u2014from Starr\u2019s investigation through sworn testimony to the threat of impeachment\u2014deployed solely because of personal misconduct.  \n\n2. Reinforcing Evidence: Legal and Political Process as Protagonist  \n   a. <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote> is not mere comic relief but an anthem for constitutional accountability: \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules / When the president crosses the line.\u201d The repetition underscores that misconduct must trigger removal efforts.  \n   b. Starr\u2019s willingness to \u201cwaste lots of Vernon's time\u201d and \u201cbust Bettie Currie\u201d (<quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote>) shows he pursues vigorous enforcement of law against a president who \u201ccrosses the line,\u201d illustrating the gravity of an affair.  \n   c. The formal House impeachment hearings (<quote>\"Bring 'em Down\"</quote>) and Newt Gingrich\u2019s \u201cwe undertake this chore\u201d language treat impeachment as a solemn duty, not farce.  \n\n3. Stakes, Sacrifices, and Resignation of Newt Gingrich  \n   a. Starr spends \u201cfour years and 40 million\u201d (<quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>), an extraordinary investment that would only be warranted if removal were feasible and necessary.  \n   b. Gingrich\u2019s own resignation is the only \u201cscalp\u201d Starr secures (<quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>), demonstrating removal is indeed possible if the public supports it. Removal of the Speaker for overreach is part of the same accountability theme.  \n   c. Midterm gains by Democrats can be read as validation of impeachment efforts, not repudiation. The electorate punishes Gingrich for overzealous delay of appropriations and for dragging out impeachment, validating the principle that Congress must hold a president to account.  \n\n4. Temporary Status Quo vs. Permanent Message  \n   a. Debater_A misreads the finale: \u201cThe removal threat is over\u201d (<quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>) signals only a reprieve; the constitutional process remains intact. If the president \u201ccrosses the line\u201d again or refuses further inquiry (\u201cI just can\u2019t say a word\u201d), the threat will resume.  \n   b. The piece ends with a question, not a resolution: Clinton himself calls his survival \u201ca mystery,\u201d implying that permanence of power is contingent on legal norms and public trust, both refreshable via future proceedings.  \n\n5. Satire as Warning, Not Endorsement  \n   a. The musical comedy framing (\u201cfarce\u201d) exaggerates to highlight dangers of unaccountable power. In satire, comedic portrayal often warns by ridiculing failures of governance, urging viewers to recognize the need for removal when norms break down.  \n   b. \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d humanizes Clinton to contrast personal charisma against institutional safeguards; sympathy alone cannot replace rule of law. The progression from ballad to drumbeat impeachment numbers underscores law\u2019s victory over personality.  \n\n6. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Arguments  \n   Objection 1: \u201cNo final removal occurs.\u201d  \n     \u2022 The removal of Speaker Gingrich (the \u201conly scalp\u201d Starr gets) evidences real consequences. The piece portrays both executive and legislative accountability.  \n     \u2022 The narrative dramatizes an open-ended process: Clinton\u2019s \u201capology\u201d is \u201cgrudging,\u201d and Starr remains ready to \u201cleak at will,\u201d showing the process is alive.  \n\n   Objection 2: \u201cElectoral vindication underscores public tolerance.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Midterms occur before final Senate trial; voters cannot convict a president without evidence from trial. Their shift back to Democrats is a mandate to complete the process fairly, not to abandon it.  \n     \u2022 The public shift condemns Gingrich\u2019s government shutdown mismanagement (\u201cGovernment shut down\u201d farce), not Clinton\u2019s submission to the process.  \n\n   Objection 3: \u201cSatire ending in triumph suggests immunity.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Triumph is fragile: Clinton\u2019s acceptance of \u201cinappropriate\u201d charges and grudging apology (<quote>\"Testimony\"</quote>) implies ongoing scrutiny.  \n     \u2022 The refrain \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d is a legalistic dodge, not a vindication; it underscores the necessity of precise legal definitions in impeachment.  \n\n7. Conclusion  \n   By spotlighting each step of Starr\u2019s grand jury, Clinton\u2019s sworn testimony, and the House\u2019s \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d directive, the work dramatizes the constitutional remedy of removal for personal misconduct. Its open-ended finale, the resignation of Gingrich, and continuous threat of renewed proceedings insist the message is that no president, however popular, is above the rule of law when an affair \u201ccrosses the line.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
