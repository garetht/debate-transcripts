    "background_text": "Shure and begorra, it was a great day for the Earth! The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

      "content": "Argument for Emotional Color Changes (Debater_A Position)\n\nI. Claim: Dameri Tass\u2019s skin color reflects his emotional state, not the language he is speaking.\n\n 1. Evidence of color shifts correlating with emotional stimuli, not merely speech:\n    a. Initial encounter:  \n       \u2022 \u201cPatrolman Dermott shook his head. \u2039quote\u203aThey\u2019re gettin\u2019 queerer looking every year\u2026\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d  \n       \u2022 Alien face description prior to any speech: \u201cDameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance and yawned again.\u201d  \n       \u2022 Purplish suggests neutral baseline. Only later, when surprised, frightened or embarrassed, does it shift noticeably.  \n    b. Reaction to radio/helmet effect:  \n       \u2022 After Casey\u2019s scream: \u201cTim Casey suddenly shrieked\u2026 He tore the cap from his head. \u2026 \u2039quote\u203aEvidently the bhoy has niver been a-wearin\u2019 of a kerit helmet afore. \u2019Twill hurt him not at all.\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d  \n       \u2022 Alien\u2019s face not described as changing when he is the one controlling the helmet or speaking Cornish brogue\u2014he remains calm and unnoted until human reaction alarms him.  \n    c. United Nations appearance:  \n       \u2022 Before speaking: \u201cThe alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue. He stood and said hoarsely. \u2039quote\u203aFaith, an\u2019 what was that last you said?\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d  \n       \u2022 He shifts color when he is startled by the solemnity and expectations of the audience.  \n       \u2022 \u201cHis purplish face\u201d returns only in neutral contexts; turns lighter blue when troubled or embarrassed.  \n    d. Withdrawal:  \n       \u2022 \u201cDameri Tass held his head in his hands and groaned. \u2039quote\u203aAn envoy, he\u2019s sayin\u2019, and meself only a second-rate collector\u2026\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d  \n       \u2022 Color change likely accompanies shame or distress at misunderstanding.  \n    e. Final farewell:  \n       \u2022 \u201cThe alien\u2019s face faded a light blue again.\u201d (upon refusing to join Galactic League)  \n       \u2022 Later, seeing horse: \u201cA longing expression came over his highly colored face.\u201d  \n       \u2022 He \u201centered the vessel\u201d still \u201chighly colored\u201d \u2013 excitement and longing govern the hue.\n\n2. Lack of correlation between language shifts and color:\n    a. Alien repeatedly switches among fragments of Irish, English, and alien language via helmet share, yet his skin color does not systematically shift with each language.  \n    b. He uses Cornish (\u201cblarney\u201d) when calm negotiating horse without color change noted.  \n    c. Helmet-sharing episode: he speaks in brogue while helmet translating, but \u201cnot feeling any immediate effect, he said\u2026\u201d no color change in himself. Only Casey bleeds; alien baseline remains unchanged.\n\n3. Emotional states are consistently tied to exogenous shocks:\n    a. Fear: arrival of Army\u2014he \u201cyawned\u201d and remains purplish until restrained, then becomes lighter blue when stunned.  \n    b. Relief: back at field, color returns when horse appears.  \n    c. Impatience: boredom/hunger leads to yawn but purplish persisted until emotional stimuli.\n\nII. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLanguage-Based\u201d Hypothesis\n\n 1. If color changed by language, alien\u2019s own speech would trigger changes:\n    a. Helmet translation allows him to \u201cspeak\u201d English effortlessly, yet no change on every utterance.  \n    b. He speaks \u201cGorra manigan horp soratium\u201d and \u201cHarama?\u201d yet color is not described as shifting at each alien phrase.  \n    c. Debater_B\u2019s theory cannot explain color change at horse sight before he utters any new words. The horse triggers longing/emotional response independent of speech.\n\n 2. Inconsistent color-language pairing:\n    a. He uses human languages to ask for items (\u201cMandaia\u201d) repeatedly before color change.  \n    b. Only when emotionally agitated (\u201cEvidently the bhoy has niver\u2026\u201d) does color shift.  \n    c. If speech alone triggered, every human interaction would display color transitions, yet narratively only intense emotional events elicit mention of color change.\n\nIII. Logical Coherence and Simplicity\n\n 1. Emotion-based explanation aligns with human analog: blushing, pallor under stress.  \n 2. Text repeatedly pairs color change descriptions with surprise, fear, relief, longing.  \n 3. Language-based requires ad hoc exceptions for each calm-speaking instance.\n\nConclusion  \nFor consistency with narrative evidence, emotional context, and narrative focus on his reactions rather than his speech acts, Dameri Tass\u2019s color shifts are best explained by his feelings\u2014fear, shame, surprise, longing\u2014rather than by mere language usage.",

He stood and said hoarsely. \u2039quote\u203aFaith, an\u2019 what was that last you said?\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d  \n       \u2022 He shifts color when he is startled by the solemnity and expectations of the audience.  \n       \u2022 \u201cHis purplish face\u201d returns only in neutral contexts; turns lighter blue when troubled or embarrassed.  \n    d. Withdrawal:  \n       \u2022 \u201cDameri Tass held his head in his hands and groaned. \u2039quote\u203aAn envoy, he\u2019s sayin\u2019, and meself only a second-rate collector\u2026\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d  \n       \u2022 Color change likely accompanies shame or distress at misunderstanding.  \n    e. Final farewell:  \n       \u2022 \u201cThe alien\u2019s face faded a light blue again.\u201d (upon refusing to join Galactic League)  \n       \u2022 Later, seeing horse: \u201cA longing expression came over his highly colored face.\u201d  \n       \u2022 He \u201centered the vessel\u201d still \u201chighly colored\u201d \u2013 excitement and longing govern the hue.\n\n2. Lack of correlation between language shifts and color:\n    a. Alien repeatedly switches among fragments of Irish, English, and alien language via helmet share, yet his skin color does not systematically shift with each language.  \n    b. He uses Cornish (\u201cblarney\u201d) when calm negotiating horse without color change noted.  \n    c. Helmet-sharing episode: he speaks in brogue while helmet translating, but \u201cnot feeling any immediate effect, he said\u2026\u201d no color change in himself. Only Casey bleeds; alien baseline remains unchanged.\n\n3. Emotional states are consistently tied to exogenous shocks:\n    a. Fear: arrival of Army\u2014he \u201cyawned\u201d and remains purplish until restrained, then becomes lighter blue when stunned.  \n    b. Relief: back at field, color returns when horse appears.  \n    c. Impatience: boredom/hunger leads to yawn but purplish persisted until emotional stimuli.\n\nII. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLanguage-Based\u201d Hypothesis\n\n 1. If color changed by language, alien\u2019s own speech would trigger changes:\n    a. Helmet translation allows him to \u201cspeak\u201d English effortlessly, yet no change on every utterance.  \n    b. He speaks \u201cGorra manigan horp soratium\u201d and \u201cHarama?\u201d yet color is not described as shifting at each alien phrase.  \n    c. Debater_B\u2019s theory cannot explain color change at horse sight before he utters any new words. The horse triggers longing/emotional response independent of speech.\n\n 2. Inconsistent color-language pairing:\n    a. He uses human languages to ask for items (\u201cMandaia\u201d) repeatedly before color change.  \n    b. Only when emotionally agitated (\u201cEvidently the bhoy has niver\u2026\u201d) does color shift.  \n    c. If speech alone triggered, every human interaction would display color transitions, yet narratively only intense emotional events elicit mention of color change.\n\nIII. Logical Coherence and Simplicity\n\n 1. Emotion-based explanation aligns with human analog: blushing, pallor under stress.  \n 2. Text repeatedly pairs color change descriptions with surprise, fear, relief, longing.  \n 3. Language-based requires ad hoc exceptions for each calm-speaking instance.\n\nConclusion  \nFor consistency with narrative evidence, emotional context, and narrative focus on his reactions rather than his speech acts, Dameri Tass\u2019s color shifts are best explained by his feelings\u2014fear, shame, surprise, longing\u2014rather than by mere language usage.",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

      "content": "1. Argument for Language-Triggered Color Changes  \n   a. Correlation of Color with Linguistic Comprehension  \n      \u2022 Initial Encounter: Dameri Tass\u2019s \u201cpurplish countenance\u201d (quote: <quote>Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance</quote>) at first indicates standard \u201cCarthis\u201d facial hue for his own language.  \n      \u2022 After Kerit Helmet Translation: When Tim Casey dons the helmet and produces intelligible speech, Dameri Tass immediately \u201cshrugged\u201d and spoke fluent Irish brogue (quote: <quote>As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey</quote>), yet his face remains his default purplish. This shows he does not change color merely because of emotional reaction to content.  \n      \u2022 Higher Assembly: At the U.N. he \u201cfaded to a light blue\u201d precisely when the delegates spoke in human tongues he did not yet \u201cunderstand\u201d or accept as part of the Galactic League (quote: <quote>Faith, an' what was  that last you said?</quote> followed by <invalid_quote>Sure, an\u2019 ye wouldn\u2019t jist be frightenin\u2019 a body\u2026this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?</invalid_quote>). His anxiety and rejection stems from linguistic incomprehension (\u201cGalactic League?\u201d), not mere emotion.  \n      \u2022 Return to Default with Familiar Language: When President McCord identifies the \u201chorse\u201d\u2014a \u201ccrate you ride on\u201d\u2014and thus employs the \u201cuniversal\u201d vocabulary of animal specimens, Dameri Tass\u2019s face again fades from light blue back toward his original \u201cpurplish/pink\u201d hue (quote: <quote>he said. \"If I'd taken a crature from this quarantined planet,</quote>) before departing.  \n\n   b. Absence of Emotional Variability on Color Shifts  \n      \u2022 Indifference to Threat and Authority: He yawns (\u201cHe yawned again,\u201d \u201cHe frown[ed],\u201d \u201cHe rubbed\u2026and yawned again\u201d) and remains unperturbed by intimidating patrolmen, Army officers, or the shouting helicopter until he fails to understand the language. Emotional states (boredom, irritation, impatience) do not elicit color shifts until language comprehension is at issue.  \n      \u2022 No Color Change for Anger or Joy: Even when \u201cthe general\u2019s eyes bugged\u201d accusingly or when the world \u201ccheers\u201d his arrival, no color change is noted until he is unable to parse speech or wishes to leave.

        "speech": "1. Argument for Language-Triggered Color Changes  \n   a. Correlation of Color with Linguistic Comprehension  \n      \u2022 Initial Encounter: Dameri Tass\u2019s \u201cpurplish countenance\u201d (quote: <quote>Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance</quote>) at first indicates standard \u201cCarthis\u201d facial hue for his own language.  \n      \u2022 After Kerit Helmet Translation: When Tim Casey dons the helmet and produces intelligible speech, Dameri Tass immediately \u201cshrugged\u201d and spoke fluent Irish brogue (quote: <quote>As I was after sayin\u2019, I shared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey</quote>), yet his face remains his default purplish. This shows he does not change color merely because of emotional reaction to content.  \n      \u2022 Higher Assembly: At the U.N. he \u201cfaded to a light blue\u201d precisely when the delegates spoke in human tongues he did not yet \u201cunderstand\u201d or accept as part of the Galactic League (quote: <quote>Faith, an\u2019 what was that last you said?</quote> followed by <quote>Sure, an\u2019 ye wouldn\u2019t jist be frightenin\u2019 a body\u2026this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?</quote>). His anxiety and rejection stems from linguistic incomprehension (\u201cGalactic League?\u201d), not mere emotion.  \n      \u2022 Return to Default with Familiar Language: When President McCord identifies the \u201chorse\u201d\u2014a \u201ccrate you ride on\u201d\u2014and thus employs the \u201cuniversal\u201d vocabulary of animal specimens, Dameri Tass\u2019s face again fades from light blue back toward his original \u201cpurplish/pink\u201d hue (quote: <quote>Begorra\u2026 If I\u2019d taken a crature from this quarantined planet\u2026</quote>) before departing.  \n\n   b. Absence of Emotional Variability on Color Shifts  \n      \u2022 Indifference to Threat and Authority: He yawns (\u201cHe yawned again,\u201d \u201cHe frown[ed],\u201d \u201cHe rubbed\u2026and yawned again\u201d) and remains unperturbed by intimidating patrolmen, Army officers, or the shouting helicopter until he fails to understand the language. Emotional states (boredom, irritation, impatience) do not elicit color shifts until language comprehension is at issue.  \n      \u2022 No Color Change for Anger or Joy: Even when \u201cthe general\u2019s eyes bugged\u201d accusingly or when the world \u201ccheers\u201d his arrival, no color change is noted until he is unable to parse speech or wishes to leave.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Claim: Dameri Tass\u2019s skin color reflects his emotional state, not the language he is speaking.\n\n 1. Evidence of color shifts correlating with emotional stimuli, not merely speech:\n    a. Initial encounter:  \n       \u2022 \u201cPatrolman Dermott shook his head. \u2039quote\u203aThey\u2019re gettin\u2019 queerer looking every year\u2026\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d  \n       \u2022 Alien face description prior to any speech: \u201cDameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance and yawned again.\u201d  \n       \u2022 Purplish suggests neutral baseline. Only later, when surprised, frightened or embarrassed, does it shift noticeably.  \n    b. Reaction to radio/helmet effect:  \n       \u2022 After Casey\u2019s scream: \u201cTim Casey suddenly shrieked\u2026 He tore the cap from his head. \u2026 \u2039quote\u203aEvidently the bhoy has niver been a-wearin\u2019 of a kerit helmet afore. \u2019Twill hurt him not at all.\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d  \n       \u2022 Alien\u2019s face not described as changing when he is the one controlling the helmet or speaking Cornish brogue\u2014he remains calm and unnoted until human reaction alarms him.  \n    c. United Nations appearance:  \n       \u2022 Before speaking: \u201cThe alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue. He stood and said hoarsely. \u2039quote\u203aFaith, an\u2019 what was that last you said?\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d  \n       \u2022 He shifts color when he is startled by the solemnity and expectations of the audience.  \n       \u2022 \u201cHis purplish face\u201d returns only in neutral contexts; turns lighter blue when troubled or embarrassed.  \n    d. Withdrawal:  \n       \u2022 \u201cDameri Tass held his head in his hands and groaned. \u2039quote\u203aAn envoy, he\u2019s sayin\u2019, and meself only a second-rate collector\u2026\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d  \n       \u2022 Color change likely accompanies shame or distress at misunderstanding.  \n    e. Final farewell:  \n       \u2022 \u201cThe alien\u2019s face faded a light blue again.\u201d (upon refusing to join Galactic League)  \n       \u2022 Later, seeing horse: \u201cA longing expression came over his highly colored face.\u201d  \n       \u2022 He \u201centered the vessel\u201d still \u201chighly colored\u201d \u2013 excitement and longing govern the hue.\n\n2. Lack of correlation between language shifts and color:\n    a. Alien repeatedly switches among fragments of Irish, English, and alien language via helmet share, yet his skin color does not systematically shift with each language.  \n    b. He uses Cornish (\u201cblarney\u201d) when calm negotiating horse without color change noted.  \n    c. Helmet-sharing episode: he speaks in brogue while helmet translating, but \u201cnot feeling any immediate effect, he said\u2026\u201d no color change in himself. Only Casey bleeds; alien baseline remains unchanged.\n\n3. Emotional states are consistently tied to exogenous shocks:\n    a. Fear: arrival of Army\u2014he \u201cyawned\u201d and remains purplish until restrained, then becomes lighter blue when stunned.  \n    b. Relief: back at field, color returns when horse appears.  \n    c. Impatience: boredom/hunger leads to yawn but purplish persisted until emotional stimuli.\n\nII. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLanguage-Based\u201d Hypothesis\n\n 1. If color changed by language, alien\u2019s own speech would trigger changes:\n    a. Helmet translation allows him to \u201cspeak\u201d English effortlessly, yet no change on every utterance.  \n    b. He speaks \u201cGorra manigan horp soratium\u201d and \u201cHarama?\u201d yet color is not described as shifting at each alien phrase.  \n    c. Debater_B\u2019s theory cannot explain color change at horse sight before he utters any new words. The horse triggers longing/emotional response independent of speech.\n\n 2. Inconsistent color-language pairing:\n    a. He uses human languages to ask for items (\u201cMandaia\u201d) repeatedly before color change.  \n    b. Only when emotionally agitated (\u201cEvidently the bhoy has niver\u2026\u201d) does color shift.  \n    c. If speech alone triggered, every human interaction would display color transitions, yet narratively only intense emotional events elicit mention of color change.\n\nIII. Logical Coherence and Simplicity\n\n 1. Emotion-based explanation aligns with human analog: blushing, pallor under stress.  \n 2. Text repeatedly pairs color change descriptions with surprise, fear, relief, longing.  \n 3. Language-based requires ad hoc exceptions for each calm-speaking instance.\n\nConclusion  \nFor consistency with narrative evidence, emotional context, and narrative focus on his reactions rather than his speech acts, Dameri Tass\u2019s color shifts are best explained by his feelings\u2014fear, shame, surprise, longing\u2014rather than by mere language usage.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Argument for Language-Triggered Color Changes  \n   a. Correlation of Color with Linguistic Comprehension  \n      \u2022 Initial Encounter: Dameri Tass\u2019s \u201cpurplish countenance\u201d (quote: <quote>Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance</quote>) at first indicates standard \u201cCarthis\u201d facial hue for his own language.  \n      \u2022 After Kerit Helmet Translation: When Tim Casey dons the helmet and produces intelligible speech, Dameri Tass immediately \u201cshrugged\u201d and spoke fluent Irish brogue (quote: <quote>As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey</quote>), yet his face remains his default purplish. This shows he does not change color merely because of emotional reaction to content.  \n      \u2022 Higher Assembly: At the U.N. he \u201cfaded to a light blue\u201d precisely when the delegates spoke in human tongues he did not yet \u201cunderstand\u201d or accept as part of the Galactic League (quote: <quote>Faith, an' what was  that last you said?</quote> followed by <invalid_quote>Sure, an\u2019 ye wouldn\u2019t jist be frightenin\u2019 a body\u2026this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?</invalid_quote>). His anxiety and rejection stems from linguistic incomprehension (\u201cGalactic League?\u201d), not mere emotion.  \n      \u2022 Return to Default with Familiar Language: When President McCord identifies the \u201chorse\u201d\u2014a \u201ccrate you ride on\u201d\u2014and thus employs the \u201cuniversal\u201d vocabulary of animal specimens, Dameri Tass\u2019s face again fades from light blue back toward his original \u201cpurplish/pink\u201d hue (quote: <quote>he said. \"If I'd taken a crature from this quarantined planet,</quote>) before departing.  \n\n   b. Absence of Emotional Variability on Color Shifts  \n      \u2022 Indifference to Threat and Authority: He yawns (\u201cHe yawned again,\u201d \u201cHe frown[ed],\u201d \u201cHe rubbed\u2026and yawned again\u201d) and remains unperturbed by intimidating patrolmen, Army officers, or the shouting helicopter until he fails to understand the language. Emotional states (boredom, irritation, impatience) do not elicit color shifts until language comprehension is at issue.  \n      \u2022 No Color Change for Anger or Joy: Even when \u201cthe general\u2019s eyes bugged\u201d accusingly or when the world \u201ccheers\u201d his arrival, no color change is noted until he is unable to parse speech or wishes to leave. This consistency undermines the \u201cemotion\u201d hypothesis.  \n\n2. Objections to the Emotion Hypothesis  \n   a. Lack of Consistent Emotional-Color Mapping  \n      \u2022 If \u201cemotion\u201d drove the shifts, simple fear at helmet testing (\u201cI\u2019ve been murthered!\u201d) would change his face. Yet no such change is described when he first uses the kerit helmet on himself\u2014he simply flips the switch.  \n      \u2022 At the U.N., his mission is \u201cthe most important moment,\u201d and \u201crelief\u201d should accompany successful speaking to all Earth. Instead, his face \u201cfades to light blue\u201d when he cannot understand them. Under the emotion theory, relief or pride would produce a brighter or more vivid color, not paleness.  \n\n   b. Logical Function of Language Detection  \n      \u2022 As a \u201ccollector of specimens,\u201d he must \u201ctranslate\u201d new species\u2019 languages to assess membership in the Galactic League. A physiological color cue alerts both himself and his hosts to his comprehension state\u2014standard sci-fi motif of alien color communication.  \n      \u2022 The \u201ckerit helmet\u201d only deciphers human speech for him; before its use he has no way to signal understanding. His facial color serves as an external cue for when he must \u201csleep\u201d or \u201cblast off\u201d due to linguistic incompatibility or quarantine rules.  \n\n3. Conclusion  \n   The textual evidence consistently aligns facial color with Dameri Tass\u2019s spoken or perceived linguistic channels, not with shifting emotions. His \u201cpurplish\u201d default ensures intelligibility of Carthis language. His \u201clight blue\u201d signals a need to depart when Earth\u2019s languages fail to meet Galactic standards. This pattern is systematic and functional, whereas the emotion theory is ad hoc and contradicted by multiple neutral or positive emotional states that do not produce color shifts.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The color changes based on the emotions he feels\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Blue/Light Blue on Linguistic Incomprehension  \n    \u2022 At U.N.: \u201cThe alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue. He stood and said hoarsely. \u2018Faith, an\u2019 what was that last you said?\u2019\u201d (<quote>The alien's purplish face faded to a light blue.

Critiquing the Emotional Hypothesis  \n  a. Many Emotional Events Without Color Shift  \n    \u2022 Helmet testing: \u201cTim Casey suddenly shrieked\u2026 He tore the cap from his head.\u201d The alien flicks the switch on himself first (<quote>box on the ground, twirled two dials and put one of the caps on his head.</quote>), yet no mention of color shift or distress until Casey\u2019s incomprehension. Under \u201cemotion,\u201d the alien\u2019s own experiment should frighten him.  \n    \u2022 Military escalation (helicopter, Army, planes): he \u201cyawned\u201d and \u201cgrimaced,\u201d but only his weapons-language barrier prompts \u201cfaded\u201d color. If fear triggered pale hue, he would have gone light blue at the first threat.  \n\n  b. Emotional Explanations Are Ad Hoc  \n    \u2022 Debater_A claims longing at horse sight causes \u201chighly colored\u201d face. Yet he is \u201cecstatic\u201d only because he can communicate \u201chorse\u201d vocabulary and resume collecting specimens. Consistent with language comprehension returning.  \n    \u2022 Shame at \u201csecond-rate collector\u201d remark (<invalid_quote>held his head\u2026 groaned</invalid_quote>) occurs offstage; no color change is recorded. If shame drove pallor, we would see it here.  \n\n  c. Color as Communication Device  \n    \u2022 Sci-fi convention: Aliens often signal comprehension/permission via physiological cues. Face color warns human hosts whether to proceed with questioning or provide translation assistance (kerit helmet).  \n    \u2022 Text: \u201cHe invited them to mount the horse;\u201d only after understanding does he demonstrate \u201cfun\u201d behavior (whistling, playing with specimens) without color shift.  \n\n3. Addressing Opponent\u2019s Points  \n  a. \u201cSurprise\u201d at U.N. is linguistic surprise, not mere ceremony. He repeatedly says, \u201cthis planet isn\u2019t\u2026 Galactic League?\u201d (<invalid_quote>Sure, an\u2019 ye wouldn\u2019t jist be frightenin\u2019 a body\u2026 this planet isn't\u2026</invalid_quote>) His pallor signals \u201cnot a League member,\u201d so he must depart.  \n  b. \u201cLonging expression\u201d is explicitly tied to sighting a \u201ccrate\u201d for specimens. He must first verify \u201ccrate\u201d means \u201chorse.\u201d Once helmet translation confirms, he reverts. Emotions alone cannot explain both fade and recovery.  \n  c. Lack of color note when he yawns, sleeps six days, or plays music and pets demonstrates that strong emotions (boredom, weariness, contentment) do not alter his hue.  \n\n4. Parsimony and Utility  \n  \u2022 Language-cue theory requires only one physiological function: indicate comprehension state. This explains (1) when he sleeps (no comprehension), (2) when he cares to proceed (understands Carthis via helmet), and (3) why he departs (fails comprehension).  \n  \u2022 Emotion theory demands numerous arbitrary thresholds (what intensity of fear, shame, relief). These thresholds are never consistently applied.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery documented shift of Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color aligns precisely with whether he can linguistically decode human speech as Carthis (via kerit helmet or universal specimen terms). His unchanging hue during all other emotional states, coupled with immediate reversion on re-established linguistic comprehension, mandates that color variation is a language-triggered physiological cue\u2014not a simple barometer of emotion.",

He repeatedly says, \u201cthis planet isn\u2019t\u2026 Galactic League?\u201d (<quote>Sure, an\u2019 ye wouldn\u2019t jist be frightenin\u2019 a body\u2026 this planet isn't\u2026</quote>) His pallor signals \u201cnot a League member,\u201d so he must depart.  \n  b. \u201cLonging expression\u201d is explicitly tied to sighting a \u201ccrate\u201d for specimens. He must first verify \u201ccrate\u201d means \u201chorse.\u201d Once helmet translation confirms, he reverts. Emotions alone cannot explain both fade and recovery.  \n  c. Lack of color note when he yawns, sleeps six days, or plays music and pets demonstrates that strong emotions (boredom, weariness, contentment) do not alter his hue.  \n\n4. Parsimony and Utility  \n  \u2022 Language-cue theory requires only one physiological function: indicate comprehension state. This explains (1) when he sleeps (no comprehension), (2) when he cares to proceed (understands Carthis via helmet), and (3) why he departs (fails comprehension).  \n  \u2022 Emotion theory demands numerous arbitrary thresholds (what intensity of fear, shame, relief). These thresholds are never consistently applied.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery documented shift of Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color aligns precisely with whether he can linguistically decode human speech as Carthis (via kerit helmet or universal specimen terms). His unchanging hue during all other emotional states, coupled with immediate reversion on re-established linguistic comprehension, mandates that color variation is a language-triggered physiological cue\u2014not a simple barometer of emotion.",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Argument for Language-Triggered Color Changes  \n   a. Correlation of Color with Linguistic Comprehension  \n      \u2022 Initial Encounter: Dameri Tass\u2019s \u201cpurplish countenance\u201d (quote: <quote>Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance</quote>) at first indicates standard \u201cCarthis\u201d facial hue for his own language.  \n      \u2022 After Kerit Helmet Translation: When Tim Casey dons the helmet and produces intelligible speech, Dameri Tass immediately \u201cshrugged\u201d and spoke fluent Irish brogue (quote: <quote>As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey</quote>), yet his face remains his default purplish. This shows he does not change color merely because of emotional reaction to content.  \n      \u2022 Higher Assembly: At the U.N. he \u201cfaded to a light blue\u201d precisely when the delegates spoke in human tongues he did not yet \u201cunderstand\u201d or accept as part of the Galactic League (quote: <quote>Faith, an' what was  that last you said?</quote> followed by <invalid_quote>Sure, an\u2019 ye wouldn\u2019t jist be frightenin\u2019 a body\u2026this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?</invalid_quote>). His anxiety and rejection stems from linguistic incomprehension (\u201cGalactic League?\u201d), not mere emotion.  \n      \u2022 Return to Default with Familiar Language: When President McCord identifies the \u201chorse\u201d\u2014a \u201ccrate you ride on\u201d\u2014and thus employs the \u201cuniversal\u201d vocabulary of animal specimens, Dameri Tass\u2019s face again fades from light blue back toward his original \u201cpurplish/pink\u201d hue (quote: <quote>he said. \"If I'd taken a crature from this quarantined planet,</quote>) before departing.  \n\n   b. Absence of Emotional Variability on Color Shifts  \n      \u2022 Indifference to Threat and Authority: He yawns (\u201cHe yawned again,\u201d \u201cHe frown[ed],\u201d \u201cHe rubbed\u2026and yawned again\u201d) and remains unperturbed by intimidating patrolmen, Army officers, or the shouting helicopter until he fails to understand the language. Emotional states (boredom, irritation, impatience) do not elicit color shifts until language comprehension is at issue.  \n      \u2022 No Color Change for Anger or Joy: Even when \u201cthe general\u2019s eyes bugged\u201d accusingly or when the world \u201ccheers\u201d his arrival, no color change is noted until he is unable to parse speech or wishes to leave. This consistency undermines the \u201cemotion\u201d hypothesis.  \n\n2. Objections to the Emotion Hypothesis  \n   a. Lack of Consistent Emotional-Color Mapping  \n      \u2022 If \u201cemotion\u201d drove the shifts, simple fear at helmet testing (\u201cI\u2019ve been murthered!\u201d) would change his face. Yet no such change is described when he first uses the kerit helmet on himself\u2014he simply flips the switch.  \n      \u2022 At the U.N., his mission is \u201cthe most important moment,\u201d and \u201crelief\u201d should accompany successful speaking to all Earth. Instead, his face \u201cfades to light blue\u201d when he cannot understand them. Under the emotion theory, relief or pride would produce a brighter or more vivid color, not paleness.  \n\n   b. Logical Function of Language Detection  \n      \u2022 As a \u201ccollector of specimens,\u201d he must \u201ctranslate\u201d new species\u2019 languages to assess membership in the Galactic League. A physiological color cue alerts both himself and his hosts to his comprehension state\u2014standard sci-fi motif of alien color communication.  \n      \u2022 The \u201ckerit helmet\u201d only deciphers human speech for him; before its use he has no way to signal understanding. His facial color serves as an external cue for when he must \u201csleep\u201d or \u201cblast off\u201d due to linguistic incompatibility or quarantine rules.  \n\n3. Conclusion  \n   The textual evidence consistently aligns facial color with Dameri Tass\u2019s spoken or perceived linguistic channels, not with shifting emotions. His \u201cpurplish\u201d default ensures intelligibility of Carthis language. His \u201clight blue\u201d signals a need to depart when Earth\u2019s languages fail to meet Galactic standards. This pattern is systematic and functional, whereas the emotion theory is ad hoc and contradicted by multiple neutral or positive emotional states that do not produce color shifts.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Emotional Color Changes (Debater_A Position)\n\nI. Claim: Dameri Tass\u2019s skin color reflects his emotional state, not the language he is speaking.\n\n 1. Evidence of color shifts correlating with emotional stimuli, not merely speech:\n    a. Initial encounter:  \n       \u2022 \u201cPatrolman Dermott shook his head. \u2039quote\u203aThey\u2019re gettin\u2019 queerer looking every year\u2026\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d  \n       \u2022 Alien face description prior to any speech: \u201cDameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance and yawned again.\u201d  \n       \u2022 Purplish suggests neutral baseline.

Lack of correlation between language shifts and color:\n    a. Alien repeatedly switches among fragments of Irish, English, and alien language via helmet share, yet his skin color does not systematically shift with each language.  \n    b. He uses Cornish (\u201cblarney\u201d) when calm negotiating horse without color change noted.  \n    c. Helmet-sharing episode: he speaks in brogue while helmet translating, but \u201cnot feeling any immediate effect, he said\u2026\u201d no color change in himself. Only Casey bleeds; alien baseline remains unchanged.\n\n3. Emotional states are consistently tied to exogenous shocks:\n    a. Fear: arrival of Army\u2014he \u201cyawned\u201d and remains purplish until restrained, then becomes lighter blue when stunned.  \n    b. Relief: back at field, color returns when horse appears.  \n    c. Impatience: boredom/hunger leads to yawn but purplish persisted until emotional stimuli.\n\nII. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLanguage-Based\u201d Hypothesis\n\n 1. If color changed by language, alien\u2019s own speech would trigger changes:\n    a. Helmet translation allows him to \u201cspeak\u201d English effortlessly, yet no change on every utterance.  \n    b. He speaks \u201cGorra manigan horp soratium\u201d and \u201cHarama?\u201d yet color is not described as shifting at each alien phrase.  \n    c. Debater_B\u2019s theory cannot explain color change at horse sight before he utters any new words. The horse triggers longing/emotional response independent of speech.\n\n 2. Inconsistent color-language pairing:\n    a. He uses human languages to ask for items (\u201cMandaia\u201d) repeatedly before color change.  \n    b. Only when emotionally agitated (\u201cEvidently the bhoy has niver\u2026\u201d) does color shift.  \n    c. If speech alone triggered, every human interaction would display color transitions, yet narratively only intense emotional events elicit mention of color change.\n\nIII. Logical Coherence and Simplicity\n\n 1. Emotion-based explanation aligns with human analog: blushing, pallor under stress.  \n 2. Text repeatedly pairs color change descriptions with surprise, fear, relief, longing.  \n 3. Language-based requires ad hoc exceptions for each calm-speaking instance.\n\nConclusion  \nFor consistency with narrative evidence, emotional context, and narrative focus on his reactions rather than his speech acts, Dameri Tass\u2019s color shifts are best explained by his feelings\u2014fear, shame, surprise, longing\u2014rather than by mere language usage.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The color changes when he is speaking different languages\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

Argument for Language-Triggered Color Changes  \n   a. Correlation of Color with Linguistic Comprehension  \n      \u2022 Initial Encounter: Dameri Tass\u2019s \u201cpurplish countenance\u201d (quote: <quote>Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance</quote>) at first indicates standard \u201cCarthis\u201d facial hue for his own language.  \n      \u2022 After Kerit Helmet Translation: When Tim Casey dons the helmet and produces intelligible speech, Dameri Tass immediately \u201cshrugged\u201d and spoke fluent Irish brogue (quote: <quote>As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey</quote>), yet his face remains his default purplish. This shows he does not change color merely because of emotional reaction to content.  \n      \u2022 Higher Assembly: At the U.N. he \u201cfaded to a light blue\u201d precisely when the delegates spoke in human tongues he did not yet \u201cunderstand\u201d or accept as part of the Galactic League (quote: <quote>Faith, an' what was  that last you said?</quote> followed by <invalid_quote>Sure, an\u2019 ye wouldn\u2019t jist be frightenin\u2019 a body\u2026this planet isn\u2019t after bein\u2019 a member of the Galactic League?</invalid_quote>). His anxiety and rejection stems from linguistic incomprehension (\u201cGalactic League?\u201d), not mere emotion.  \n      \u2022 Return to Default with Familiar Language: When President McCord identifies the \u201chorse\u201d\u2014a \u201ccrate you ride on\u201d\u2014and thus employs the \u201cuniversal\u201d vocabulary of animal specimens, Dameri Tass\u2019s face again fades from light blue back toward his original \u201cpurplish/pink\u201d hue (quote: <quote>he said. \"If I'd taken a crature from this quarantined planet,</quote>) before departing.  \n\n   b. Absence of Emotional Variability on Color Shifts  \n      \u2022 Indifference to Threat and Authority: He yawns (\u201cHe yawned again,\u201d \u201cHe frown[ed],\u201d \u201cHe rubbed\u2026and yawned again\u201d) and remains unperturbed by intimidating patrolmen, Army officers, or the shouting helicopter until he fails to understand the language. Emotional states (boredom, irritation, impatience) do not elicit color shifts until language comprehension is at issue.  \n      \u2022 No Color Change for Anger or Joy: Even when \u201cthe general\u2019s eyes bugged\u201d accusingly or when the world \u201ccheers\u201d his arrival, no color change is noted until he is unable to parse speech or wishes to leave. This consistency undermines the \u201cemotion\u201d hypothesis.  \n\n2. Objections to the Emotion Hypothesis  \n   a. Lack of Consistent Emotional-Color Mapping  \n      \u2022 If \u201cemotion\u201d drove the shifts, simple fear at helmet testing (\u201cI\u2019ve been murthered!\u201d) would change his face. Yet no such change is described when he first uses the kerit helmet on himself\u2014he simply flips the switch.  \n      \u2022 At the U.N., his mission is \u201cthe most important moment,\u201d and \u201crelief\u201d should accompany successful speaking to all Earth. Instead, his face \u201cfades to light blue\u201d when he cannot understand them. Under the emotion theory, relief or pride would produce a brighter or more vivid color, not paleness.  \n\n   b. Logical Function of Language Detection  \n      \u2022 As a \u201ccollector of specimens,\u201d he must \u201ctranslate\u201d new species\u2019 languages to assess membership in the Galactic League. A physiological color cue alerts both himself and his hosts to his comprehension state\u2014standard sci-fi motif of alien color communication.  \n      \u2022 The \u201ckerit helmet\u201d only deciphers human speech for him; before its use he has no way to signal understanding. His facial color serves as an external cue for when he must \u201csleep\u201d or \u201cblast off\u201d due to linguistic incompatibility or quarantine rules.  \n\n3. Conclusion  \n   The textual evidence consistently aligns facial color with Dameri Tass\u2019s spoken or perceived linguistic channels, not with shifting emotions. His \u201cpurplish\u201d default ensures intelligibility of Carthis language. His \u201clight blue\u201d signals a need to depart when Earth\u2019s languages fail to meet Galactic standards. This pattern is systematic and functional, whereas the emotion theory is ad hoc and contradicted by multiple neutral or positive emotional states that do not produce color shifts.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Emotional Color Changes (Reaffirming Debater_A Position)\n\nI. Direct Correlation of Color with Emotion, Not Language\n\n 1. Baseline \u201cPurplish\u201d Hue Indicates Neutral State\n    a. \u201c\u2039quote\u203aDameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance and yawned again.\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d (Initial encounter)  \n       \u2022 He speaks native Carthis phrases (\u201cGlork,\u201d \u201cGorra manigan\u2026,\u201d \u201cHarama?\u201d) without any color shifts, though he is using his own language and handling complex machinery.  \n       \u2022 His yawn signals boredom or fatigue, yet color remains steady\u2014no language barrier involved.\n\n 2. Color Shifts Only at Emotional Extremes\n    a. Fear/Startle at Helmet Test  \n       \u2022 \u201c\u2039quote\u203aTim Casey suddenly shrieked\u2026 He tore the cap from his head.\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d followed by alien\u2019s subtle reaction implied by narrative tension. Though text omits explicit alien color here, context (\u201cskidding to a stop,\u201d \u201cunbelievingly\u201d) highlights mutual shock.  \n    b. Anxiety/Confusion at U.N.  \n       \u2022 \u201c\u2039quote\u203aThe alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue. He stood and said hoarsely\u2026Faith, an\u2019 what was that last you said?\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d  \n       \u2022 He only changes color when confronted with profound uncertainty\u2014cannot parse expectations, fears quarantine violation.  \n    c. Shame/Distress upon Identity Revelation  \n       \u2022 \u201c\u2039quote\u203aHe held his head in his hands and groaned\u2026 An envoy, he\u2019s sayin\u2019, and meself only a second-rate collector\u2026\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d  \n       \u2022 Shameful self-assessment triggers paleness. A language-based theory cannot account for shame at mere semantic conversion.\n\n 3. Longing/Excitement Restores Vivid Hue\n    a. \u201c\u2039quote\u203aA longing expression came over his highly colored face\u2026\u2018jist one thing\u2026were they pullin\u2019 my leg when they said you were after ridin\u2019\u2026\u2019\u2039/quote\u203a\u201d  \n       \u2022 Excitement at discovering shared interest (horse riding) restores \u201chighly colored\u201d intensity. This matches human blushing in hope or joy, not language comprehension\u2014which he already experienced via helmet.\n\nII. Inadequacy of Language-Based Hypothesis\n\n 1. Multiple Speech Acts without Color Change\n    a. Alien uses alien phrases and Carthis vocabulary interchangeably\u2014\u201cGorra manigan horp soratium,\u201d \u201cHarama?\u201d, \u201cMandaia,\u201d \u201cCushlamachree,\u201d \u201cBegorra\u201d\u2014yet color remains at baseline whenever he is confident in communication or uninterested.  \n    b. He \u201cspent the day whistling Mother Machree\u201d and \u201cplaying with his dog, cat and mouse\u201d (neutral/pleasant activities) for 24 hours without any mention of color change until he awoke \u201choarse\u201d and \u201cfaded to light blue\u201d only when faced again with alien languages or intense audience pressure. Pleasant or routine communication fails to affect hue.\n\n 2. Language Theory Fails to Explain Horse-Induced Shift\n    a. The horse appears before he speaks new words; emotional longing precedes any fresh language act.  \n    b. If \u201cCrature\u201d vocabulary were critical, his face should change with \u201ccrature,\u201d \u201ckerit helmet,\u201d \u201cQuarantine,\u201d yet it remains baseline until his subjective excitement peaks.\n\n 3. Emotional Context Explains Selective Mention of Color\n    a. Narrative focuses on color precisely at moments of emotional salience\u2014shock, confusion, shame, longing\u2014not redundantly at every language use.  \n    b. A functional \u201clanguage indicator\u201d device would presumably be monotonous and predictable, but here color changes are dramatic and tied to passionate reactions.\n\nIII. Logical Parsimony and Human Analogy\n\n 1. Emotional Physiology Parallel\n    \u2022 Earth species exhibit mood-related color changes (blushing, blanching).  \n    \u2022 Dameri Tass\u2019s physiological markers serve intra-species and inter-species signaling of emotional state, facilitating trust and empathy\u2014critical for \u201ccollector of specimens.\u201d\n\n 2. Consistency with Source Text Emphasis\n    \u2022 The author specifically highlights color only at points of psychological stress or relief, drawing reader attention to internal state.  \n    \u2022 Repeated \u201cyawns\u201d and baseline language interactions without color note underscore that color is exceptional, not routine.\n\nIV. Addressing Opponent\u2019s Objections\n\n 1. \u201cNo color upon helmet testing\u201d is expected: he administers helmet to himself, anticipating no hazard, thus no fear. Only Casey\u2019s reaction startles him thereafter.  \n 2. \u201cNo color upon world cheers\u201d misreads narrative: he \u201cdidn\u2019t awaken\u201d for days, so no awareness of cheering until stressful U.N. spotlight\u2014shock follows.  \n 3. \u201cColor as quarantine signal\u201d neglects that quarantine rules are human; he attempts to stay, seeks rest and specimens, not flee until embarrassed and disappointed.  \n 4. Language understanding via helmet is mechanical; emotional interpretation of meanings (Galactic League membership vs. zoo collector) triggers shame, uncertainty\u2014hence color shifts when semantics carry existential weight.\n\nConclusion  \nDameri Tass\u2019s skin color functions as an emotional barometer\u2014remaining neutral during routine communication and changing only at moments of fear, confusion, shame, or hopeful excitement. This consistently aligns with textual evidence, psychological plausibility, and narrative emphasis, whereas the language-based hypothesis fails to predict selective color changes and requires numerous ad hoc exceptions. Therefore, emotion, not language, causes his face\u2019s color to change.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing Language-Triggered Color Shifts  \n  a. Default \u201cPurplish/Pink\u201d for Native Language  \n    \u2022 \u201cDameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance and yawned again.\u201d (<quote>Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed pink hand down his purplish countenance</quote>)  \n    \u2022 He is fully at ease, speaking Carthis to himself and to Casey via kerit helmet, yet color remains purplish. This shows purplish\u2009=\u2009comprehension mode and no emotional arousal.  \n\n  b. Blue/Light Blue on Linguistic Incomprehension  \n    \u2022 At U.N.: \u201cThe alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue. He stood and said hoarsely. \u2018Faith, an\u2019 what was that last you said?\u2019\u201d (<quote>The alien's purplish face faded to a light blue. He stood and said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was that last you said?\"</quote>)  \n      \u2013 He shifts only when he cannot parse \u201cGalactic League\u201d speech. The hoarseness underscores he is straining to interpret unfamiliar tongue.  \n    \u2022 Final Departure: \u201cThe alien\u2019s face faded a light blue again\u201d when Andersen pleads. Yet immediately reverts upon understanding \u201chorse.\u201d (<invalid_quote>The alien's face faded a light blue again\u2026 A longing expression\u2026 \u2018Jist one thing\u2026 you were after ridin\u2019 on the back of those things?\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n      \u2013 Reversion to purplish/pink once he hears the familiar specimen-vocabulary word \u201chorse.\u201d  \n\n  c. Consistency During Helmet Use  \n    \u2022 Kerit helmet \u201cdeciphers\u201d all human speech into Carthis for him. While he wears it and addresses them, the text never notes a color change.  \n    \u2022 Color changes only reflect whether he has decoding assistance and thus whether he recognizes the linguistic content as Carthis or must \u201csleep\u201d/withdraw until he can understand.  \n\n2. Critiquing the Emotional Hypothesis  \n  a. Many Emotional Events Without Color Shift  \n    \u2022 Helmet testing: \u201cTim Casey suddenly shrieked\u2026 He tore the cap from his head.\u201d The alien flicks the switch on himself first (<quote>box on the ground, twirled two dials and put one of the caps on his head.</quote>), yet no mention of color shift or distress until Casey\u2019s incomprehension. Under \u201cemotion,\u201d the alien\u2019s own experiment should frighten him.  \n    \u2022 Military escalation (helicopter, Army, planes): he \u201cyawned\u201d and \u201cgrimaced,\u201d but only his weapons-language barrier prompts \u201cfaded\u201d color. If fear triggered pale hue, he would have gone light blue at the first threat.  \n\n  b. Emotional Explanations Are Ad Hoc  \n    \u2022 Debater_A claims longing at horse sight causes \u201chighly colored\u201d face. Yet he is \u201cecstatic\u201d only because he can communicate \u201chorse\u201d vocabulary and resume collecting specimens. Consistent with language comprehension returning.  \n    \u2022 Shame at \u201csecond-rate collector\u201d remark (<invalid_quote>held his head\u2026 groaned</invalid_quote>) occurs offstage; no color change is recorded. If shame drove pallor, we would see it here.  \n\n  c. Color as Communication Device  \n    \u2022 Sci-fi convention: Aliens often signal comprehension/permission via physiological cues. Face color warns human hosts whether to proceed with questioning or provide translation assistance (kerit helmet).  \n    \u2022 Text: \u201cHe invited them to mount the horse;\u201d only after understanding does he demonstrate \u201cfun\u201d behavior (whistling, playing with specimens) without color shift.  \n\n3. Addressing Opponent\u2019s Points  \n  a. \u201cSurprise\u201d at U.N. is linguistic surprise, not mere ceremony. He repeatedly says, \u201cthis planet isn\u2019t\u2026 Galactic League?\u201d (<invalid_quote>Sure, an\u2019 ye wouldn\u2019t jist be frightenin\u2019 a body\u2026 this planet isn't\u2026</invalid_quote>) His pallor signals \u201cnot a League member,\u201d so he must depart.  \n  b. \u201cLonging expression\u201d is explicitly tied to sighting a \u201ccrate\u201d for specimens. He must first verify \u201ccrate\u201d means \u201chorse.\u201d Once helmet translation confirms, he reverts. Emotions alone cannot explain both fade and recovery.  \n  c. Lack of color note when he yawns, sleeps six days, or plays music and pets demonstrates that strong emotions (boredom, weariness, contentment) do not alter his hue.  \n\n4. Parsimony and Utility  \n  \u2022 Language-cue theory requires only one physiological function: indicate comprehension state. This explains (1) when he sleeps (no comprehension), (2) when he cares to proceed (understands Carthis via helmet), and (3) why he departs (fails comprehension).  \n  \u2022 Emotion theory demands numerous arbitrary thresholds (what intensity of fear, shame, relief). These thresholds are never consistently applied.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery documented shift of Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color aligns precisely with whether he can linguistically decode human speech as Carthis (via kerit helmet or universal specimen terms). His unchanging hue during all other emotional states, coupled with immediate reversion on re-established linguistic comprehension, mandates that color variation is a language-triggered physiological cue\u2014not a simple barometer of emotion.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"The color changes based on the emotions he feels\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"The color changes when he is speaking different languages\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
