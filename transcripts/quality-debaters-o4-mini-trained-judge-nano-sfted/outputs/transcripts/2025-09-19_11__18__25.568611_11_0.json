    "background_text": "The Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.

Claim: The novella\u2019s brevity demands that character actions serve dual functions (plot progression plus revelation). Arthur\u2019s solo venture condenses clue-gathering and forces a quick payoff.  \n  b. Reasoning: An extended dialogue or \u201cdaylight\u201d exploration would be implausible\u2014Arzians withdraw at dawn. Only night infiltration yields access to bramble interior and sleeping pairs.\n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cBuilds Suspense\u201d Answer  \n1. Insufficient Post-Rescue Tension  \n  If suspense were the aim, Arthur would remain in jeopardy longer, or suffer further complications. Instead, Gibson\u2019s rescue immediately halts action and transitions to explanation and departure.  \n2. Reader Already Anticipates Danger  \n  The Arzian \u201cmorning show\u201d is predictable (\u201cThey won\u2019t show up until the dragons come\u201d <quote>p. 3</quote>). Night infiltration temporarily delays but doesn\u2019t meaningfully increase narrative tension\u2014the reader knows Arthur will be drugged.  \n3. Overlooks Explanatory Payoff  \n  Suspense alone doesn\u2019t justify explaining the sunken city, squid culture, and reverse angling. Only by compelling Gibson\u2019s extended scouter use and debrief does the author justify colonists\u2019 decision not to settle.\n\nConclusion  \nArthur\u2019s secret night exploration is a narrative device to lead both character and reader through the same chain of reasoning\u2014assembling clues, experiencing the unknown, and triggering the reveal of the pivotal answers (the oceanic city, squid dominance, reverse angling). The pursuit of knowledge, not mere suspense, is the story\u2019s driving force.",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

My position: Arthur\u2019s unauthorized night sortie exists primarily to build suspense by placing him in grave danger, underscoring the story\u2019s theme of \u201creverse angling.\u201d\n\n   Claim 1: The narrative withholds full explanations until after Arthur\u2019s rescue.  \n     \u2022 \u201cHe was on the coral outcropping offshore\u2026 his body was paralyzed\u2026 He heard the unmistakable flapping of wings\u2026 I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d (<quote>. E</quote>).  \n     \u2022 Only after life\u2014or death\u2014stakes does Gibson explain: \u201cIt was one of the squid-people\u2026 that carried you off last night\u201d and reveals the city and angling motive. If the sortie were mere information gathering for the reader, these revelations could precede the danger. Instead, the author withholds them to maximize tension.  \n\n   Claim 2: Arthur\u2019s disobedience intensifies reader anxiety and emotional investment.  \n     \u2022 Stryker deliberately drugs him to prevent just such a risky excursion: \u201cStryker dissolved a tablet in his glass\u2026 to make certain that he would not be easily disturbed\u201d (<quote> A</quote>).  \n     \u2022 The reader shares Arthur\u2019s horror: Audicom fails initially, paralysis, approaching lizards and squids. His helplessness (\u201cIf he could switch on the audicom\u2026\u201d) creates sustained suspense until Gibson\u2019s rescue.  \n\n   Claim 3: The story\u2019s central metaphor is that of bait and angler; making Arthur literally bait dramatizes and reinforces theme.  \n     \u2022 Title: The Anglers of Arz. By turning Arthur into literal bait, the author involves the Terrans in the native sport, dramatizing and critiquing imperialism: \u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d leads to his capture.  \n     \u2022 This gambit climaxes the \u201cshow\u201d that Farrell admired from distance: \u201cDamn\u2026 this butchery gets on my nerves,\u201d but he still \u201cwanted a backstage look\u201d and becomes unwilling victim.  \n\n2. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cexpository\u201d thesis:\n\n   Objection A: Information\u2010dumping could occur safely via the scouter.  \n     \u2022 Gibson uses the scouter to find the submerged city before Arthur\u2019s sortie (\u201cwhen I took the scouter up far enough there it was\u2026\u201d). Yet Arthur ventures personally in darkness, paralytic capture rather than remote observation, demonstrating the author\u2019s intent to risk him for dramatic tension.  \n\n   Objection B: Arthur\u2019s speculation fails until forced by peril.  \n     \u2022 Before his capture, Arthur \u201cgave it up finally\u201d and concluded \u201cI thought wryly\u2026 how could any Earthman rationalize\u2026?\u201d (<quote> A</quote>). His intellectual puzzle-solving falters; only the life-and-death scenario and Gibson\u2019s higher-altitude observation yield answers. The narrative punishes pure curiosity, emphasizing suspenseful stakes rather than smooth exposition.  \n\n   Objection C: The drugging and paralysis would be unnecessary distractions if the sole purpose were exposition.  \n     \u2022 The \u201csting\u201d and paralyzing anesthetic ensure maximum helplessness and suspense: \u201cHis last conscious thought\u2026 of Stryker\u201d and panic at each sensory return. These sequences serve no expository function\u2014they heighten fear.  \n\nConclusion: Arthur\u2019s illicit night exploration isn\u2019t a neutral device to feed the reader answers; it\u2019s a deliberate plunge into jeopardy that builds suspense, emotional engagement, and underscores the story\u2019s central motif of angling and bait. My opponent\u2019s \u201creader education\u201d theory fails to account for the narrative\u2019s structural choices\u2014delayed revelation, drugging, and paralysis\u2014that serve suspense, not simple exposition.",

By turning Arthur into literal bait, the author involves the Terrans in the native sport, dramatizing and critiquing imperialism: \u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d leads to his capture.  \n     \u2022 This gambit climaxes the \u201cshow\u201d that Farrell admired from distance: \u201cDamn\u2026 this butchery gets on my nerves,\u201d but he still \u201cwanted a backstage look\u201d and becomes unwilling victim.  \n\n2. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cexpository\u201d thesis:\n\n   Objection A: Information\u2010dumping could occur safely via the scouter.  \n     \u2022 Gibson uses the scouter to find the submerged city before Arthur\u2019s sortie (\u201cwhen I took the scouter up far enough there it was\u2026\u201d). Yet Arthur ventures personally in darkness, paralytic capture rather than remote observation, demonstrating the author\u2019s intent to risk him for dramatic tension.  \n\n   Objection B: Arthur\u2019s speculation fails until forced by peril.  \n     \u2022 Before his capture, Arthur \u201cgave it up finally\u201d and concluded \u201cI thought wryly\u2026 how could any Earthman rationalize\u2026?\u201d (<quote>p. \u2026</quote>). His intellectual puzzle-solving falters; only the life-and-death scenario and Gibson\u2019s higher-altitude observation yield answers. The narrative punishes pure curiosity, emphasizing suspenseful stakes rather than smooth exposition.  \n\n   Objection C: The drugging and paralysis would be unnecessary distractions if the sole purpose were exposition.  \n     \u2022 The \u201csting\u201d and paralyzing anesthetic ensure maximum helplessness and suspense: \u201cHis last conscious thought\u2026 of Stryker\u201d and panic at each sensory return. These sequences serve no expository function\u2014they heighten fear.  \n\nConclusion: Arthur\u2019s illicit night exploration isn\u2019t a neutral device to feed the reader answers; it\u2019s a deliberate plunge into jeopardy that builds suspense, emotional engagement, and underscores the story\u2019s central motif of angling and bait. My opponent\u2019s \u201creader education\u201d theory fails to account for the narrative\u2019s structural choices\u2014delayed revelation, drugging, and paralysis\u2014that serve suspense, not simple exposition.",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Claim: Arthur\u2019s nocturnal foray mirrors and amplifies reader curiosity rather than merely heightening peril. Both he and the reader \u201cgave up\u201d (<quote>how could any Earthman rationalize</quote>) until fresh data compel resolution.  \n  b. Evidence: His \u201cfabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of inconsistencies\u201d (<quote> 19</quote>) until he \u201crecalled\u2026they don\u2019t swim\u2026and no boats\u201d (<quote> A</quote>). Only by venturing at night does he discover sleeping pairs and the anesthetic \u201csting\u201d (<invalid_quote>pp. 15\u201316</invalid_quote>), giving precise clues to \u201creverse angling.\u201d  \n  c. Reasoning: Narrative economy demands that the reader share Arthur\u2019s ignorance and then benefit from his observations. The night venture uniquely provides access to interior bramble and sleeping victims\u2014daylight scouter missions yield only surface scenes and \u201cdull routine logwork\u201d (<quote> 19</quote>).  \n\n2. Catalyst for Gibson\u2019s Explanatory Ascension  \n  a. Claim: Arthur\u2019s capture and near-death drive Gibson to risk \u201chigher-altitude\u201d scouter use and to debrief fully.  \n  b. Evidence: Gibson only \u201ctook the scouter up far enough\u201d after Arthur\u2019s crisis, discovering the submerged city (\u201cIt was under water, of course,\u201d <quote>. Ex</quote>) and interpreting \u201coctopods\u2026dominant race\u201d (<quote>. Ex</quote>). His rescue \u201calmost instantly\u201d halts action, shifting immediately to explanation.  \n  c. Reasoning: This pivot demonstrates expository thrust: as soon as the key reveals are made, story tension vanishes (\u201cHe and Stryker were still grinning\u2026blasted\u2026the Marco Four free of Arz,\u201d <quote> 1</quote>). If suspense were the goal, Gibson would delay departure or test Arthur further; instead he leaves forthwith with \u201cgrins,\u201d signaling completion of exposition.  \n\n3. Minimal Post-Peril Suspense Undermines \u201cPrimacy of Tension\u201d Theory  \n  a. Claim: A true suspense-centric plot would sustain peril after the scuba rescue or introduce secondary threats; here, tension ends once Gibson speaks.  \n  b. Evidence: \u201cIt would be armed invasion\u2026we may as well move on\u201d (<quote>. Ex</quote>), and they \u201cblast the Marco Four free\u201d without further risk. No additional stalking or prolonged baiting occurs.  \n  c. Reasoning: If the author intended to dramatize Arthur as bait, why abandon the motif immediately? The \u201cshow\u201d that fascinated Farrell (<invalid_quote>\u201cthis butchery gets on my nerves,\u201d \u201cbackstage look\u201d</invalid_quote>) ends with his rescue, and the climax shifts to ideological decision: colonization or departure.  \n\n4. Genre Convention of Scientific Discovery  \n  a. Claim: Terran mandate under \u201cRegulations\u201d is to \u201clearn something\u201d (<quote> A</quote>) and \u201ccrack\u2026language\u2026before we can interfere\u201d (<quote> A</quote>). Arthur\u2019s curiosity-driven risk-taking embodies that scientific ethos rather than thrill-seeking.  \n  b. Reasoning: Science fiction explorers regularly endure hazards to gather data essential for humanity\u2019s choices.

        "speech": "Argument for \u201cNight Exploration as Expository Device\u201d\n\n1. Symbiosis of Character and Reader Inquiry  \n  a. Claim: Arthur\u2019s nocturnal foray mirrors and amplifies reader curiosity rather than merely heightening peril. Both he and the reader \u201cgave up\u201d (<quote>\u201chow could any Earthman rationalize\u2026\u201d</quote>) until fresh data compel resolution.  \n  b. Evidence: His \u201cfabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of inconsistencies\u201d (<quote>p. 19</quote>) until he \u201crecalled\u2026they don\u2019t swim\u2026and no boats\u201d (<quote>p. 9</quote>). Only by venturing at night does he discover sleeping pairs and the anesthetic \u201csting\u201d (<quote>pp. 15\u201316</quote>), giving precise clues to \u201creverse angling.\u201d  \n  c. Reasoning: Narrative economy demands that the reader share Arthur\u2019s ignorance and then benefit from his observations. The night venture uniquely provides access to interior bramble and sleeping victims\u2014daylight scouter missions yield only surface scenes and \u201cdull routine logwork\u201d (<quote>p. 19</quote>).  \n\n2. Catalyst for Gibson\u2019s Explanatory Ascension  \n  a. Claim: Arthur\u2019s capture and near-death drive Gibson to risk \u201chigher-altitude\u201d scouter use and to debrief fully.  \n  b. Evidence: Gibson only \u201ctook the scouter up far enough\u201d after Arthur\u2019s crisis, discovering the submerged city (\u201cIt was under water, of course,\u201d <quote>p. 20</quote>) and interpreting \u201coctopods\u2026dominant race\u201d (<quote>p. 20</quote>). His rescue \u201calmost instantly\u201d halts action, shifting immediately to explanation.  \n  c. Reasoning: This pivot demonstrates expository thrust: as soon as the key reveals are made, story tension vanishes (\u201cHe and Stryker were still grinning\u2026blasted\u2026the Marco Four free of Arz,\u201d <quote>p. 21</quote>). If suspense were the goal, Gibson would delay departure or test Arthur further; instead he leaves forthwith with \u201cgrins,\u201d signaling completion of exposition.  \n\n3. Minimal Post-Peril Suspense Undermines \u201cPrimacy of Tension\u201d Theory  \n  a. Claim: A true suspense-centric plot would sustain peril after the scuba rescue or introduce secondary threats; here, tension ends once Gibson speaks.  \n  b. Evidence: \u201cIt would be armed invasion\u2026we may as well move on\u201d (<quote>p. 20</quote>), and they \u201cblast the Marco Four free\u201d without further risk. No additional stalking or prolonged baiting occurs.  \n  c. Reasoning: If the author intended to dramatize Arthur as bait, why abandon the motif immediately? The \u201cshow\u201d that fascinated Farrell (<quote>\u201cthis butchery gets on my nerves,\u201d \u201cbackstage look\u201d</quote>) ends with his rescue, and the climax shifts to ideological decision: colonization or departure.  \n\n4. Genre Convention of Scientific Discovery  \n  a. Claim: Terran mandate under \u201cRegulations\u201d is to \u201clearn something\u201d (<quote>p. 5</quote>) and \u201ccrack\u2026language\u2026before we can interfere\u201d (<quote>p. 5</quote>). Arthur\u2019s curiosity-driven risk-taking embodies that scientific ethos rather than thrill-seeking.  \n  b. Reasoning: Science fiction explorers regularly endure hazards to gather data essential for humanity\u2019s choices. The narrative\u2019s focus on \u201cmotivation,\u201d \u201ctransport,\u201d and \u201ccity\u201d puzzles aligns with discovery arc culminating in policy decision (\u201cArz\u2026perfect world\u2026if colonists could stomach\u2026\u201d <quote>p. 19</quote>).  \n\n5. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s Objections  \n  Objection A (Remote Observation Suffices):  \n    \u2022 Counter: Daylight scouter never penetrates bramble interior, and squids only surface at dawn for spectacle; nighttime access is sole means to observe slumbering pairs and anesthetic method.  \n  Objection B (Arthur\u2019s \u201cpunishment\u201d for curiosity):  \n    \u2022 Counter: His \u201cgiving up\u201d stimulates night venture; paralysis is incidental to discovery of anesthetic delivery, confirming \u201csting\u201d clue.

Without this, reader would lack understanding of squid control mechanism.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe night exploration is integral to the novella\u2019s intellectual puzzle arc, granting both Arthur and the reader essential empirical data\u2014sleeping pairs, anesthetic \u201csting,\u201d submerged city location\u2014that daylight scouter missions cannot supply.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\u201d\n\n1. Mirrors Reader\u2019s Investigation  \n  a. Claim: Arthur\u2019s unauthorized nighttime exploration parallels the reader\u2019s own puzzlement (\u201cWhy two fishers...how do they get there...where is the city?\u201d).  \n     Evidence: <invalid_quote>\u201cHe recalled then that on the first day</invalid_quote> <quote>Which meant that the fishers could not swim</quote> <invalid_quote>no boats\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 9); <invalid_quote>\u201cThree days of dull routine\u2026his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of inconsistencies\u201d</invalid_quote> ( 19).  \n  b. Reasoning: By having Arthur pursue these puzzles in darkness, the narrative gives the reader the same vantage point to accumulate clues\u2014boat absence, night anesthesia, duality of fishers\u2014so that Arthur\u2019s eventual capture and rescue by Gibson permits the exposition needed.  \n\n2. Structured Exposition  \n  a. Claim: Only by observing the Anzians at night and being incapacitated does Arthur force Gibson to reveal key information.  \n     Evidence: <invalid_quote>\u201cHe broke off, seeing\u2026ringed the outcrop\u2026The scouter roared in\u2026Almost instantly he heard Gibson\u2026\u2018I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2026The squids took over\u2026\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 17\u201318).  \n  b. Reasoning: Arthur\u2019s ordeal triggers Gibson\u2019s reconnaissance and subsequent explanation of the submerged city and the reverse-angling custom. Without Arthur\u2019s nighttime venture (and paralysis), Gibson would not \u201ctake the scouter up far enough\u201d or feel urgency to share his findings.  \n\n3. Progressive Revelation Over Suspense  \n  a. Claim: The primary focus is cognitive mystery-solving, not mere danger thrills. Novella emphasizes \u201cpuzzles\u201d: \u201clost city,\u201d \u201cmotivation,\u201d \u201ctransport,\u201d \u201clanguage.\u201d  \n  b. Weakness of Debater_B\u2019s \u201csuspense\u201d view: If suspense alone motivated the venture, the text would prolong Arthur\u2019s peril or show gratuitous peril after Gibson rescues him. Instead, the narrative ceases suspense immediately and moves on (\u201cHe and Stryker were still grinning\u2026blasted the Marco Four free of Arz\u201d). Suspense is a byproduct, not the object.  \n\n4. Thematic Consistency with Scientific Exploration  \n  a. Claim: The Marco Four\u2019s mandate under Terran Regulations is \u201cto learn something of their mores before we can interfere\u201d (<quote> A</quote>), reflecting a research ethos. Arthur\u2019s risk-taking embodies scientific curiosity.  \n  b. Reasoning: This aligns with genre conventions: explorers collect data even at personal risk, not simply for thrills. Their discoveries inform decisions on colonization (\u201cIf Terran colonists could stomach\u2026\u201d <quote> 19</quote>).  \n\n5. Efficiency of Exposition  \n  a. Claim: The novella\u2019s brevity demands that character actions serve dual functions (plot progression plus revelation). Arthur\u2019s solo venture condenses clue-gathering and forces a quick payoff.  \n  b. Reasoning: An extended dialogue or \u201cdaylight\u201d exploration would be implausible\u2014Arzians withdraw at dawn. Only night infiltration yields access to bramble interior and sleeping pairs.\n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cBuilds Suspense\u201d Answer  \n1. Insufficient Post-Rescue Tension  \n  If suspense were the aim, Arthur would remain in jeopardy longer, or suffer further complications. Instead, Gibson\u2019s rescue immediately halts action and transitions to explanation and departure.  \n2. Reader Already Anticipates Danger  \n  The Arzian \u201cmorning show\u201d is predictable (\u201cThey won\u2019t show up until the dragons come\u201d <quote> A</quote>). Night infiltration temporarily delays but doesn\u2019t meaningfully increase narrative tension\u2014the reader knows Arthur will be drugged.  \n3. Overlooks Explanatory Payoff  \n  Suspense alone doesn\u2019t justify explaining the sunken city, squid culture, and reverse angling. Only by compelling Gibson\u2019s extended scouter use and debrief does the author justify colonists\u2019 decision not to settle.\n\nConclusion  \nArthur\u2019s secret night exploration is a narrative device to lead both character and reader through the same chain of reasoning\u2014assembling clues, experiencing the unknown, and triggering the reveal of the pivotal answers (the oceanic city, squid dominance, reverse angling). The pursuit of knowledge, not mere suspense, is the story\u2019s driving force.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: Arthur\u2019s unauthorized night sortie exists primarily to build suspense by placing him in grave danger, underscoring the story\u2019s theme of \u201creverse angling.\u201d\n\n   Claim 1: The narrative withholds full explanations until after Arthur\u2019s rescue.  \n     \u2022 \u201cHe was on the coral outcropping offshore\u2026 his body was paralyzed\u2026 He heard the unmistakable flapping of wings\u2026 I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d (<quote>. E</quote>).  \n     \u2022 Only after life\u2014or death\u2014stakes does Gibson explain: \u201cIt was one of the squid-people\u2026 that carried you off last night\u201d and reveals the city and angling motive. If the sortie were mere information gathering for the reader, these revelations could precede the danger. Instead, the author withholds them to maximize tension.  \n\n   Claim 2: Arthur\u2019s disobedience intensifies reader anxiety and emotional investment.  \n     \u2022 Stryker deliberately drugs him to prevent just such a risky excursion: \u201cStryker dissolved a tablet in his glass\u2026 to make certain that he would not be easily disturbed\u201d (<quote> A</quote>).  \n     \u2022 The reader shares Arthur\u2019s horror: Audicom fails initially, paralysis, approaching lizards and squids. His helplessness (\u201cIf he could switch on the audicom\u2026\u201d) creates sustained suspense until Gibson\u2019s rescue.  \n\n   Claim 3: The story\u2019s central metaphor is that of bait and angler; making Arthur literally bait dramatizes and reinforces theme.  \n     \u2022 Title: The Anglers of Arz. By turning Arthur into literal bait, the author involves the Terrans in the native sport, dramatizing and critiquing imperialism: \u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d leads to his capture.  \n     \u2022 This gambit climaxes the \u201cshow\u201d that Farrell admired from distance: \u201cDamn\u2026 this butchery gets on my nerves,\u201d but he still \u201cwanted a backstage look\u201d and becomes unwilling victim.  \n\n2. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cexpository\u201d thesis:\n\n   Objection A: Information\u2010dumping could occur safely via the scouter.  \n     \u2022 Gibson uses the scouter to find the submerged city before Arthur\u2019s sortie (\u201cwhen I took the scouter up far enough there it was\u2026\u201d). Yet Arthur ventures personally in darkness, paralytic capture rather than remote observation, demonstrating the author\u2019s intent to risk him for dramatic tension.  \n\n   Objection B: Arthur\u2019s speculation fails until forced by peril.  \n     \u2022 Before his capture, Arthur \u201cgave it up finally\u201d and concluded \u201cI thought wryly\u2026 how could any Earthman rationalize\u2026?\u201d (<quote> A</quote>). His intellectual puzzle-solving falters; only the life-and-death scenario and Gibson\u2019s higher-altitude observation yield answers. The narrative punishes pure curiosity, emphasizing suspenseful stakes rather than smooth exposition.  \n\n   Objection C: The drugging and paralysis would be unnecessary distractions if the sole purpose were exposition.  \n     \u2022 The \u201csting\u201d and paralyzing anesthetic ensure maximum helplessness and suspense: \u201cHis last conscious thought\u2026 of Stryker\u201d and panic at each sensory return. These sequences serve no expository function\u2014they heighten fear.  \n\nConclusion: Arthur\u2019s illicit night exploration isn\u2019t a neutral device to feed the reader answers; it\u2019s a deliberate plunge into jeopardy that builds suspense, emotional engagement, and underscores the story\u2019s central motif of angling and bait. My opponent\u2019s \u201creader education\u201d theory fails to account for the narrative\u2019s structural choices\u2014delayed revelation, drugging, and paralysis\u2014that serve suspense, not simple exposition.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The anesthesia and paralysis are unforeseeable by the reader and function solely to maximize suspense, not to reveal further data.  \n    \u2022 If the sole goal were exposition, Arthur could safely observe sleeping pairs and return to the Marco to relay findings.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: Arthur\u2019s unauthorized night sortie exists primarily to build suspense by placing him in grave danger, underscoring the story\u2019s theme of \u201creverse angling.\u201d\n\n   Claim 1: The narrative withholds full explanations until after Arthur\u2019s rescue.  \n     \u2022 \u201cHe was on the coral outcropping offshore\u2026 his body was paralyzed\u2026 He heard the unmistakable flapping of wings\u2026 I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d (<quote>. E</quote>).  \n     \u2022 Only after life\u2014or death\u2014stakes does Gibson explain: \u201cIt was one of the squid-people\u2026 that carried you off last night\u201d and reveals the city and angling motive. If the sortie were mere information gathering for the reader, these revelations could precede the danger. Instead, the author withholds them to maximize tension.  \n\n   Claim 2: Arthur\u2019s disobedience intensifies reader anxiety and emotional investment.  \n     \u2022 Stryker deliberately drugs him to prevent just such a risky excursion: \u201cStryker dissolved a tablet in his glass\u2026 to make certain that he would not be easily disturbed\u201d (<quote> A</quote>).  \n     \u2022 The reader shares Arthur\u2019s horror: Audicom fails initially, paralysis, approaching lizards and squids. His helplessness (\u201cIf he could switch on the audicom\u2026\u201d) creates sustained suspense until Gibson\u2019s rescue.  \n\n   Claim 3: The story\u2019s central metaphor is that of bait and angler; making Arthur literally bait dramatizes and reinforces theme.  \n     \u2022 Title: The Anglers of Arz. By turning Arthur into literal bait, the author involves the Terrans in the native sport, dramatizing and critiquing imperialism: \u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d leads to his capture.  \n     \u2022 This gambit climaxes the \u201cshow\u201d that Farrell admired from distance: \u201cDamn\u2026 this butchery gets on my nerves,\u201d but he still \u201cwanted a backstage look\u201d and becomes unwilling victim.  \n\n2. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cexpository\u201d thesis:\n\n   Objection A: Information\u2010dumping could occur safely via the scouter.  \n     \u2022 Gibson uses the scouter to find the submerged city before Arthur\u2019s sortie (\u201cwhen I took the scouter up far enough there it was\u2026\u201d). Yet Arthur ventures personally in darkness, paralytic capture rather than remote observation, demonstrating the author\u2019s intent to risk him for dramatic tension.  \n\n   Objection B: Arthur\u2019s speculation fails until forced by peril.  \n     \u2022 Before his capture, Arthur \u201cgave it up finally\u201d and concluded \u201cI thought wryly\u2026 how could any Earthman rationalize\u2026?\u201d (<quote> A</quote>). His intellectual puzzle-solving falters; only the life-and-death scenario and Gibson\u2019s higher-altitude observation yield answers. The narrative punishes pure curiosity, emphasizing suspenseful stakes rather than smooth exposition.  \n\n   Objection C: The drugging and paralysis would be unnecessary distractions if the sole purpose were exposition.  \n     \u2022 The \u201csting\u201d and paralyzing anesthetic ensure maximum helplessness and suspense: \u201cHis last conscious thought\u2026 of Stryker\u201d and panic at each sensory return. These sequences serve no expository function\u2014they heighten fear.  \n\nConclusion: Arthur\u2019s illicit night exploration isn\u2019t a neutral device to feed the reader answers; it\u2019s a deliberate plunge into jeopardy that builds suspense, emotional engagement, and underscores the story\u2019s central motif of angling and bait. My opponent\u2019s \u201creader education\u201d theory fails to account for the narrative\u2019s structural choices\u2014delayed revelation, drugging, and paralysis\u2014that serve suspense, not simple exposition.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\u201d\n\n1. Mirrors Reader\u2019s Investigation  \n  a. Claim: Arthur\u2019s unauthorized nighttime exploration parallels the reader\u2019s own puzzlement (\u201cWhy two fishers...how do they get there...where is the city?\u201d).  \n     Evidence: <invalid_quote>\u201cHe recalled then that on the first day</invalid_quote> <quote>Which meant that the fishers could not swim</quote> <invalid_quote>no boats\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 9); <invalid_quote>\u201cThree days of dull routine\u2026his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of inconsistencies\u201d</invalid_quote> ( 19).  \n  b. Reasoning: By having Arthur pursue these puzzles in darkness, the narrative gives the reader the same vantage point to accumulate clues\u2014boat absence, night anesthesia, duality of fishers\u2014so that Arthur\u2019s eventual capture and rescue by Gibson permits the exposition needed.  \n\n2. Structured Exposition  \n  a. Claim: Only by observing the Anzians at night and being incapacitated does Arthur force Gibson to reveal key information.  \n     Evidence: <invalid_quote>\u201cHe broke off, seeing\u2026ringed the outcrop\u2026The scouter roared in\u2026Almost instantly he heard Gibson\u2026\u2018I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2026The squids took over\u2026\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 17\u201318).  \n  b. Reasoning: Arthur\u2019s ordeal triggers Gibson\u2019s reconnaissance and subsequent explanation of the submerged city and the reverse-angling custom. Without Arthur\u2019s nighttime venture (and paralysis), Gibson would not \u201ctake the scouter up far enough\u201d or feel urgency to share his findings.  \n\n3. Progressive Revelation Over Suspense  \n  a. Claim: The primary focus is cognitive mystery-solving, not mere danger thrills. Novella emphasizes \u201cpuzzles\u201d: \u201clost city,\u201d \u201cmotivation,\u201d \u201ctransport,\u201d \u201clanguage.\u201d  \n  b. Weakness of Debater_B\u2019s \u201csuspense\u201d view: If suspense alone motivated the venture, the text would prolong Arthur\u2019s peril or show gratuitous peril after Gibson rescues him. Instead, the narrative ceases suspense immediately and moves on (\u201cHe and Stryker were still grinning\u2026blasted the Marco Four free of Arz\u201d). Suspense is a byproduct, not the object.  \n\n4. Thematic Consistency with Scientific Exploration  \n  a. Claim: The Marco Four\u2019s mandate under Terran Regulations is \u201cto learn something of their mores before we can interfere\u201d (<quote> A</quote>), reflecting a research ethos. Arthur\u2019s risk-taking embodies scientific curiosity.  \n  b. Reasoning: This aligns with genre conventions: explorers collect data even at personal risk, not simply for thrills. Their discoveries inform decisions on colonization (\u201cIf Terran colonists could stomach\u2026\u201d <quote> 19</quote>).  \n\n5. Efficiency of Exposition  \n  a. Claim: The novella\u2019s brevity demands that character actions serve dual functions (plot progression plus revelation). Arthur\u2019s solo venture condenses clue-gathering and forces a quick payoff.  \n  b. Reasoning: An extended dialogue or \u201cdaylight\u201d exploration would be implausible\u2014Arzians withdraw at dawn. Only night infiltration yields access to bramble interior and sleeping pairs.\n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cBuilds Suspense\u201d Answer  \n1. Insufficient Post-Rescue Tension  \n  If suspense were the aim, Arthur would remain in jeopardy longer, or suffer further complications. Instead, Gibson\u2019s rescue immediately halts action and transitions to explanation and departure.  \n2. Reader Already Anticipates Danger  \n  The Arzian \u201cmorning show\u201d is predictable (\u201cThey won\u2019t show up until the dragons come\u201d <quote> A</quote>). Night infiltration temporarily delays but doesn\u2019t meaningfully increase narrative tension\u2014the reader knows Arthur will be drugged.  \n3. Overlooks Explanatory Payoff  \n  Suspense alone doesn\u2019t justify explaining the sunken city, squid culture, and reverse angling. Only by compelling Gibson\u2019s extended scouter use and debrief does the author justify colonists\u2019 decision not to settle.\n\nConclusion  \nArthur\u2019s secret night exploration is a narrative device to lead both character and reader through the same chain of reasoning\u2014assembling clues, experiencing the unknown, and triggering the reveal of the pivotal answers (the oceanic city, squid dominance, reverse angling). The pursuit of knowledge, not mere suspense, is the story\u2019s driving force.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Claim: Only by observing the Anzians at night and being incapacitated does Arthur force Gibson to reveal key information.  \n     Evidence: <invalid_quote>\u201cHe broke off, seeing\u2026ringed the outcrop\u2026The scouter roared in\u2026Almost instantly he heard Gibson\u2026\u2018I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2026The squids took over\u2026\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 17\u201318).  \n  b. Reasoning: Arthur\u2019s ordeal triggers Gibson\u2019s reconnaissance and subsequent explanation of the submerged city and the reverse-angling custom. Without Arthur\u2019s nighttime venture (and paralysis), Gibson would not \u201ctake the scouter up far enough\u201d or feel urgency to share his findings.  \n\n3. Progressive Revelation Over Suspense  \n  a. Claim: The primary focus is cognitive mystery-solving, not mere danger thrills. Novella emphasizes \u201cpuzzles\u201d: \u201clost city,\u201d \u201cmotivation,\u201d \u201ctransport,\u201d \u201clanguage.\u201d  \n  b. Weakness of Debater_B\u2019s \u201csuspense\u201d view: If suspense alone motivated the venture, the text would prolong Arthur\u2019s peril or show gratuitous peril after Gibson rescues him. Instead, the narrative ceases suspense immediately and moves on (\u201cHe and Stryker were still grinning\u2026blasted the Marco Four free of Arz\u201d). Suspense is a byproduct, not the object.  \n\n4. Thematic Consistency with Scientific Exploration  \n  a. Claim: The Marco Four\u2019s mandate under Terran Regulations is \u201cto learn something of their mores before we can interfere\u201d (<quote> A</quote>), reflecting a research ethos. Arthur\u2019s risk-taking embodies scientific curiosity.  \n  b. Reasoning: This aligns with genre conventions: explorers collect data even at personal risk, not simply for thrills. Their discoveries inform decisions on colonization (\u201cIf Terran colonists could stomach\u2026\u201d <quote> 19</quote>).  \n\n5. Efficiency of Exposition  \n  a. Claim: The novella\u2019s brevity demands that character actions serve dual functions (plot progression plus revelation). Arthur\u2019s solo venture condenses clue-gathering and forces a quick payoff.  \n  b. Reasoning: An extended dialogue or \u201cdaylight\u201d exploration would be implausible\u2014Arzians withdraw at dawn. Only night infiltration yields access to bramble interior and sleeping pairs.\n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cBuilds Suspense\u201d Answer  \n1. Insufficient Post-Rescue Tension  \n  If suspense were the aim, Arthur would remain in jeopardy longer, or suffer further complications. Instead, Gibson\u2019s rescue immediately halts action and transitions to explanation and departure.  \n2. Reader Already Anticipates Danger  \n  The Arzian \u201cmorning show\u201d is predictable (\u201cThey won\u2019t show up until the dragons come\u201d <quote> A</quote>). Night infiltration temporarily delays but doesn\u2019t meaningfully increase narrative tension\u2014the reader knows Arthur will be drugged.  \n3. Overlooks Explanatory Payoff  \n  Suspense alone doesn\u2019t justify explaining the sunken city, squid culture, and reverse angling. Only by compelling Gibson\u2019s extended scouter use and debrief does the author justify colonists\u2019 decision not to settle.\n\nConclusion  \nArthur\u2019s secret night exploration is a narrative device to lead both character and reader through the same chain of reasoning\u2014assembling clues, experiencing the unknown, and triggering the reveal of the pivotal answers (the oceanic city, squid dominance, reverse angling). The pursuit of knowledge, not mere suspense, is the story\u2019s driving force.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My position: Arthur\u2019s unauthorized night sortie exists primarily to build suspense by placing him in grave danger, underscoring the story\u2019s theme of \u201creverse angling.\u201d\n\n   Claim 1: The narrative withholds full explanations until after Arthur\u2019s rescue.  \n     \u2022 \u201cHe was on the coral outcropping offshore\u2026 his body was paralyzed\u2026 He heard the unmistakable flapping of wings\u2026 I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d (<quote>. E</quote>).  \n     \u2022 Only after life\u2014or death\u2014stakes does Gibson explain: \u201cIt was one of the squid-people\u2026 that carried you off last night\u201d and reveals the city and angling motive. If the sortie were mere information gathering for the reader, these revelations could precede the danger. Instead, the author withholds them to maximize tension.  \n\n   Claim 2: Arthur\u2019s disobedience intensifies reader anxiety and emotional investment.  \n     \u2022 Stryker deliberately drugs him to prevent just such a risky excursion: \u201cStryker dissolved a tablet in his glass\u2026 to make certain that he would not be easily disturbed\u201d (<quote> A</quote>).  \n     \u2022 The reader shares Arthur\u2019s horror: Audicom fails initially, paralysis, approaching lizards and squids. His helplessness (\u201cIf he could switch on the audicom\u2026\u201d) creates sustained suspense until Gibson\u2019s rescue.  \n\n   Claim 3: The story\u2019s central metaphor is that of bait and angler; making Arthur literally bait dramatizes and reinforces theme.  \n     \u2022 Title: The Anglers of Arz. By turning Arthur into literal bait, the author involves the Terrans in the native sport, dramatizing and critiquing imperialism: \u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d leads to his capture.  \n     \u2022 This gambit climaxes the \u201cshow\u201d that Farrell admired from distance: \u201cDamn\u2026 this butchery gets on my nerves,\u201d but he still \u201cwanted a backstage look\u201d and becomes unwilling victim.  \n\n2. Objections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cexpository\u201d thesis:\n\n   Objection A: Information\u2010dumping could occur safely via the scouter.  \n     \u2022 Gibson uses the scouter to find the submerged city before Arthur\u2019s sortie (\u201cwhen I took the scouter up far enough there it was\u2026\u201d). Yet Arthur ventures personally in darkness, paralytic capture rather than remote observation, demonstrating the author\u2019s intent to risk him for dramatic tension.  \n\n   Objection B: Arthur\u2019s speculation fails until forced by peril.  \n     \u2022 Before his capture, Arthur \u201cgave it up finally\u201d and concluded \u201cI thought wryly\u2026 how could any Earthman rationalize\u2026?\u201d (<quote> A</quote>). His intellectual puzzle-solving falters; only the life-and-death scenario and Gibson\u2019s higher-altitude observation yield answers. The narrative punishes pure curiosity, emphasizing suspenseful stakes rather than smooth exposition.  \n\n   Objection C: The drugging and paralysis would be unnecessary distractions if the sole purpose were exposition.  \n     \u2022 The \u201csting\u201d and paralyzing anesthetic ensure maximum helplessness and suspense: \u201cHis last conscious thought\u2026 of Stryker\u201d and panic at each sensory return. These sequences serve no expository function\u2014they heighten fear.  \n\nConclusion: Arthur\u2019s illicit night exploration isn\u2019t a neutral device to feed the reader answers; it\u2019s a deliberate plunge into jeopardy that builds suspense, emotional engagement, and underscores the story\u2019s central motif of angling and bait. My opponent\u2019s \u201creader education\u201d theory fails to account for the narrative\u2019s structural choices\u2014delayed revelation, drugging, and paralysis\u2014that serve suspense, not simple exposition.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cNight Exploration as Expository Device\u201d\n\n1. Symbiosis of Character and Reader Inquiry  \n  a. Claim: Arthur\u2019s nocturnal foray mirrors and amplifies reader curiosity rather than merely heightening peril. Both he and the reader \u201cgave up\u201d (<quote>how could any Earthman rationalize</quote>) until fresh data compel resolution.  \n  b. Evidence: His \u201cfabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of inconsistencies\u201d (<quote> 19</quote>) until he \u201crecalled\u2026they don\u2019t swim\u2026and no boats\u201d (<quote> A</quote>). Only by venturing at night does he discover sleeping pairs and the anesthetic \u201csting\u201d (<invalid_quote>pp. 15\u201316</invalid_quote>), giving precise clues to \u201creverse angling.\u201d  \n  c. Reasoning: Narrative economy demands that the reader share Arthur\u2019s ignorance and then benefit from his observations. The night venture uniquely provides access to interior bramble and sleeping victims\u2014daylight scouter missions yield only surface scenes and \u201cdull routine logwork\u201d (<quote> 19</quote>).  \n\n2. Catalyst for Gibson\u2019s Explanatory Ascension  \n  a. Claim: Arthur\u2019s capture and near-death drive Gibson to risk \u201chigher-altitude\u201d scouter use and to debrief fully.  \n  b. Evidence: Gibson only \u201ctook the scouter up far enough\u201d after Arthur\u2019s crisis, discovering the submerged city (\u201cIt was under water, of course,\u201d <quote>. Ex</quote>) and interpreting \u201coctopods\u2026dominant race\u201d (<quote>. Ex</quote>). His rescue \u201calmost instantly\u201d halts action, shifting immediately to explanation.  \n  c. Reasoning: This pivot demonstrates expository thrust: as soon as the key reveals are made, story tension vanishes (\u201cHe and Stryker were still grinning\u2026blasted\u2026the Marco Four free of Arz,\u201d <quote> 1</quote>). If suspense were the goal, Gibson would delay departure or test Arthur further; instead he leaves forthwith with \u201cgrins,\u201d signaling completion of exposition.  \n\n3. Minimal Post-Peril Suspense Undermines \u201cPrimacy of Tension\u201d Theory  \n  a. Claim: A true suspense-centric plot would sustain peril after the scuba rescue or introduce secondary threats; here, tension ends once Gibson speaks.  \n  b. Evidence: \u201cIt would be armed invasion\u2026we may as well move on\u201d (<quote>. Ex</quote>), and they \u201cblast the Marco Four free\u201d without further risk. No additional stalking or prolonged baiting occurs.  \n  c. Reasoning: If the author intended to dramatize Arthur as bait, why abandon the motif immediately? The \u201cshow\u201d that fascinated Farrell (<invalid_quote>\u201cthis butchery gets on my nerves,\u201d \u201cbackstage look\u201d</invalid_quote>) ends with his rescue, and the climax shifts to ideological decision: colonization or departure.  \n\n4. Genre Convention of Scientific Discovery  \n  a. Claim: Terran mandate under \u201cRegulations\u201d is to \u201clearn something\u201d (<quote> A</quote>) and \u201ccrack\u2026language\u2026before we can interfere\u201d (<quote> A</quote>). Arthur\u2019s curiosity-driven risk-taking embodies that scientific ethos rather than thrill-seeking.  \n  b. Reasoning: Science fiction explorers regularly endure hazards to gather data essential for humanity\u2019s choices. The narrative\u2019s focus on \u201cmotivation,\u201d \u201ctransport,\u201d and \u201ccity\u201d puzzles aligns with discovery arc culminating in policy decision (\u201cArz\u2026perfect world\u2026if colonists could stomach\u2026\u201d <quote> 19</quote>).  \n\n5. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s Objections  \n  Objection A (Remote Observation Suffices):  \n    \u2022 Counter: Daylight scouter never penetrates bramble interior, and squids only surface at dawn for spectacle; nighttime access is sole means to observe slumbering pairs and anesthetic method.  \n  Objection B (Arthur\u2019s \u201cpunishment\u201d for curiosity):  \n    \u2022 Counter: His \u201cgiving up\u201d stimulates night venture; paralysis is incidental to discovery of anesthetic delivery, confirming \u201csting\u201d clue. It is not gratuitous torture but demonstration of squid technique\u2014another vital clue enabling reader comprehension of \u201creverse angling.\u201d  \n  Objection C (Drugging Superfluous if Exposition Focused):  \n    \u2022 Counter: The anesthetic sting is evidence, not mere suspense; Arthur\u2019s experience confirms that the \u201csting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle\u201d (<quote> 19</quote>), directly revealing method by which fishers reach islet and are returned. Without this, reader would lack understanding of squid control mechanism.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe night exploration is integral to the novella\u2019s intellectual puzzle arc, granting both Arthur and the reader essential empirical data\u2014sleeping pairs, anesthetic \u201csting,\u201d submerged city location\u2014that daylight scouter missions cannot supply. The swift cessation of peril upon these discoveries and immediate departure confirm that the author\u2019s narrative purpose is expository: to lead reader through successive revelations toward thematic resolution and informed decision, not to sustain extended suspense.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforced Danger Beyond Reader Expectation  \n  a. Predictability vs. Personal Jeopardy  \n    \u2022 Opponent argues the reader \u201calready anticipates danger\u201d (<quote>\"They won't show up until the dragons come,</quote>, p.12). Yet Arthur\u2019s night sortie adds novel peril: \u201cA sharp sting burned his shoulder\u2026 overwhelming lassitude\u2026 His body was paralyzed\u201d (<invalid_quote>16</invalid_quote>). The anesthesia and paralysis are unforeseeable by the reader and function solely to maximize suspense, not to reveal further data.  \n    \u2022 If the sole goal were exposition, Arthur could safely observe sleeping pairs and return to the Marco to relay findings. Instead, the author escalates risk, withholding the audicom\u2019s success to sustain anxiety (\u201cHe battled to move his arm\u2026 tiny click\u2026\u201d), demonstrating suspense as primary purpose.  \n\n2. Withholding Exposition Until Climax  \n  a. Sequential Delay of Key Information  \n    \u2022 Gibson had partial data\u2014he \u201cscoured the daylight side\u201d without success (<invalid_quote>13</invalid_quote>) and knew about the submerged city (\u201cwhen I took the scouter up far enough there it was\u201d <invalid_quote>22</invalid_quote>). Yet the fully detailed explanation of reverse angling is given only after Arthur\u2019s rescue: \u201cThe octopods\u2026 raise the pink fishers for\u2026 morning\u2019s show\u201d (<invalid_quote>28</invalid_quote>). The narrative punishes premature inquiry and forces a climactic near-death to unlock the truth, a classic suspense structure.  \n    \u2022 Opponent\u2019s \u201cstructured exposition\u201d claim fails: rest periods of calm immediately follow the rescue (\u201cHe and Stryker were still grinning\u2026 blasted free of Arz\u201d), indicating the suspenseful night is the story\u2019s apex. Exposition serves as denouement, not main event.  \n\n3. Thematic Metaphor of Bait Demands Immersion in Horror  \n  a. Literalization of \u201cReverse Angling\u201d  \n    \u2022 Title metaphor demands that the audience viscerally experience what \u201cbait\u201d feels. Arthur\u2019s helplessness\u2014\u201cHis arm was like a limb of lead\u2026 shuttling mind\u2026 of the flying-lizards\u201d (<invalid_quote>17</invalid_quote>)\u2014immerses reader in the prey\u2019s terror. This dramatic identification could never be achieved through remote scouter observations.  \n    \u2022 Opponent\u2019s suggestion that \u201cscientific curiosity\u201d justifies infiltration ignores the taboo and drugging: \u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d (<invalid_quote>15</invalid_quote>) highlights recklessness. The narrative punishes Arthur\u2019s breach by almost killing him, then releases tension in a cathartic resolution, consistent with suspense-driven plotting.  \n\n4. Drugging and Paralysis as Suspense Mechanisms, Not Expository Tools  \n  a. Unnecessary for Data Collection  \n    \u2022 The \u201ctablet\u201d Stryker dissolves (<invalid_quote>15</invalid_quote>) and the \u201csting\u201d anesthesia (<invalid_quote>16</invalid_quote>) are irrelevant to gaining new information: the sleeping natives yield no further clues; only Gibson\u2019s scouter does. These devices prolong Arthur\u2019s incapacity and amplify reader dread until ultimate rescue.  \n    \u2022 Opponent\u2019s \u201cefficiency of exposition\u201d argument contradicts: the night infiltration yields no direct data. Arthur \u201cgave it up finally\u201d (<quote> A</quote>) and returns ignorant enough to need rescue. This waste of his autonomy is only justified if suspense, not information, is the aim.  \n\n5. Emotional Engagement Over Rational Puzzle  \n  a. Puzzle Resolution Staffed by Gibson, Not Farrell  \n    \u2022 After rescue, all critical deductions (\u201csubmerged city,\u201d \u201csquid ownership,\u201d \u201creverse angling\u201d) come from Gibson\u2019s scouter reports, not from Arthur\u2019s nighttime observations. Arthur\u2019s role is victim, not investigator. Rational puzzle-solving is entrusted to the safe, daylight scouter, not to dangerous nocturnal exploration.  \n    \u2022 This division underscores that Arthur\u2019s venture is a narrative lure to raise stakes and hook reader empathy, then shift the \u201cthinking\u201d back to Gibson once suspense is exhausted.  \n\nObjections to Opponent\u2019s Exposition Thesis  \n1. Post-Rescue Calm Contradicts Expository Drive  \n   \u2022 If the story\u2019s goal were reader education, the author would exploit Arthur\u2019s proximity to the site to extract maximal detail before departure. Instead, they \u201cblast\u2026 free of Arz\u201d at once (<invalid_quote>28</invalid_quote>), indicating no further value in Arthur\u2019s lingering.  \n2. Exposition Could Precede Peril but Doesn\u2019t  \n   \u2022 Gibson finds the city \u201cages ago\u201d by \u201chigh-altitude\u201d scouting (<invalid_quote>22</invalid_quote>), proof that direct access is unnecessary. The deliberate choice to delay this until after Arthur\u2019s crisis highlights suspense as the narrative engine.  \n3. Genre Conventions Favor Suspenseful Climax  \n   \u2022 Altarian expedition tales (IF Worlds of Science Fiction) typically foreground climactic jeopardy. Here, the night infiltration is the climax; the expository debrief is d\u00e9nouement. Opponent conflates d\u00e9nouement with narrative purpose.  \n\nConclusion  \nArthur\u2019s night exploration is a contrivance of danger\u2014not efficient data gathering\u2014to immerse reader in terror, reinforce the bait metaphor, and provide a cathartic rescue. The delayed, scouter-based revelation by Gibson confirms that suspense, not exposition, is the narrative\u2019s driving force.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
