{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 456, "background_text": "The Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it?

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair.

Strict Monotonic Progression by Slate Rating  \n  a. Every successive block of entries corresponds to increasingly positive Slate ratings. The list begins with \u20139 (Clinton), then \u20137 (Morris, Tripp), \u20135 (Carville, Lindsey ~ \u20135), \u20133, \u20132, 0, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, and culminates at +10 (Chelsea) before \u201cMore Flytrap\u2026\u201d (<quote>Slate rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9</quote>).  \n  b. No exceptions to this ascending order: even judges opposed by Debater_B (e.g., Paula Jones +1) appear only after all Slate \u2013\u2019s and 0s. If \u201cprominence\u201d were primary, ratings would intermix arbitrarily.  \n\n2. Inexplicable Placement Contradicts Prominence Theory  \n  a. Monica Lewinsky (Slate \u20132) appears well after Bruce Lindsey (approx \u20135) despite Debater_B\u2019s own concession that Lindsey\u2019s \u201cnot enough information\u201d rating should demote him if moral sympathy ruled. Instead Lindsey appears early because he is a low Slate rating, not \u201cprominent.\u201d  \n  b. Betty Currie (+8 public; Slate \u20132) sits mid\u2010list among negatives and neutrals. If prominence prevailed, Clinton\u2019s confidante would appear nearer the top; instead her low Slate score consigns her to the \u201cless liked\u201d region.  \n  c. Secret Service (+5) precedes Hillary (+2) and Gore (+3) only because their Slate ratings are lower (Secret Service +5 is more sympathetic than Gore +3).

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

Ordering Mirrors Slate Ratings  \n  a. \u201cScorecard\u201d explicitly uses a \u201310 to +10 scale (<quote>       rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9 </quote> for Bill Clinton).  \n  b. The list starts with Bill Clinton at \u20139, then other strongly negative ratings (Dick Morris: \u20137; Linda Tripp: \u20137), proceeds incrementally upward through near-neutral (Bob Barr: 0) and ends with very positive ratings (Chelsea Clinton: +10).  \n  c. This strictly monotonic progression from negative to positive is not plausibly explained by \u201cprominence.\u201d If \u201cprominence\u201d were primary, highly prominent figures like Hillary Clinton (+2) or Al Gore (+3) would appear sooner. Instead they are placed only after low-rated or mid-rated actors.\n\n2. Author\u2019s Own Commentary Emphasizes Moral \u201cRecalibration\u201d  \n  a. The introductory essay urges rethinking sympathy (\u201cmoral recalibration\u201d), praising some underrated and criticizing some overrated (e.g., Monica Lewinsky at \u20132 vs public\u2019s \u20139).  \n  b. By placing Lewinsky (\u20132) above many loyal but culpable aides (e.g., Currie at \u20132) and below truly sympathetic groups (Secret Service +5, Chelsea +10), the author is guiding readers from condemnation toward sympathy as ratings rise.\n\n3. Exceptions to \u201cProminence\u201d Theory  \n  a. Judge Kenneth Starr (public \u20139; Slate +1) ranks below Bob Barr (Slate 0) despite Starr\u2019s greater prominence.  \n  b. Rep. Henry Hyde (Slate +4) appears near end, after lesser-known figures like Erskine Bowles (+4). By prominence theory, Hyde would rank earlier.  \n  c. Kathleen Willey (Slate +2) precedes well-known Cabinet members (Slate +3) only because Cabinet collectively is rated more sympathetic.  \n  d. Secret Service (public +8; Slate +5) and Chelsea (+10) finish the list, though Secret Service agents are faceless and Chelsea is a private citizen\u2014hardly \u201cmost prominent.\u201d\n\n4. Structural Note: \u201cMore Flytrap \u2026\u201d after Chelsea  \n  a. After Chelsea (+10), the author appends \u201cMore Flytrap ...\u201d implying continuation. The highest rating so far signals list\u2019s end in ascending sympathy. This punctuation would be unnecessary if order were arbitrary or by prominence.\n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s Position Fails to Account for Many Placements  \n  a. Debater_B cannot explain why high-profile loyalists like George Stephanopoulos (Slate \u20132) or Paul Begala (\u20132) appear among negatives or neutrals if prominence dominated.  \n  b. The public\u2019s own \u201cpublic rating\u201d often contradicts Slate\u2019s ordering; e.g., Monica\u2019s public \u20139 vs Slate \u20132 places her mid-list, indicating author\u2019s moral sympathy ordering prevails over public awareness.\n\nObjections to \u201cProminence\u201d Theory  \n1. Prominence Vs. Sympathy Confusion  \n  Most readers know Bill & Lewinsky best, yet Lewinsky is mid-list. If it were \u201cprominence,\u201d the most talked-about names would cluster at top or bottom.\n\n2. Hypocritical Loyalists Contradict Prominence  \n  The author criticizes late-turning loyalists like Stephanopoulos for hypocrisy; their eventual prominence in scandal only arises after publication, so they should not be so high if \u201cprominence\u201d matter.\n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence shows the author intentionally orders individuals by Slate\u2019s negative-to-positive moral rating. The systematic progression from the least to most liked, reinforced by authorial commentary about \u201csympathy\u201d and \u201cmoral recalibration,\u201d decisively supports \u201cLeast Liked to Most Liked\u201d as the organizing principle.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cRanked from Most Prominent to Least Prominent\u201d\n\nSummary of My Position  \nI contend that Slate\u2019s \u201cScorecard\u201d is ordered roughly by each individual or group\u2019s prominence in the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal or in national politics, descending from most prominent (Bill Clinton) to least prominent (e.g., minor figures,  More Flytrap ..). The listing follows a familiar journalistic hierarchy of importance, not a simple sympathy/approval scale.\n\n1. Top Item Is Clearly the Most Prominent Figure  \n- <quote>Bill Clinton</quote> leads the list (Slate rating \u20139), even though his public rating is \u20136 (moderately negative).  \n- If ordering by sympathy, Clinton\u2019s \u20139 would place him near the bottom, not the top.  \n\n2. Early Entries Are Key Architects of the Cover-Up  \n- Next appear Dick Morris (\u20137), Linda Tripp (\u20137), James Carville (\u20135), Bruce Lindsey (approx. \u20135).  \n- These are the figures most central to the affair\u2019s inception, denial strategy, and investigative drama.  \n- Their prominence precedes lesser-known aides and peripheral claimants.  \n\n3. Transition to Peripheral and Victimized Figures  \n- Only after listing major advisers does Slate include Monica Lewinsky (\u20132), Betty Currie (\u20132), Paul Begala (\u20132), Rahm Emanuel (\u20132), Ann Lewis (\u20132).  \n- These figures, though noteworthy, are less central than the president and his chief strategists.  \n- E.g., Currie\u2019s rating +8 is high sympathy but she appears well below Clinton and Morris (<quote>Slate rating: -2</quote> for Currie).  \n\n4. Finale with Broadly Victimized or Obscure Figures  \n- At the end appear the Cabinet collectively (+3), Erskine Bowles (+4), Henry Hyde (+4), Secret Service (+5), Chelsea Clinton (+10), and then  More Flytrap ..  \n- These are individuals/groups peripherally dragged into the scandal (e.g., Secret Service \u201cunwillingly\u201d <quote> Dragged unwillingly into scandal </quote>) or so minor Slate leaves them nub.  \n- If ordering by sympathy, they would scatter amid the middle, not cluster at the end.  \n\n5. Consistency with Journalistic Precedent  \n- Slate explicitly says \u201cBelow is\u2026 Scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap\u2019s key players.\u201d Journalists uniformly list the principal subjects first.  \n- Debater_A\u2019s <invalid_quote>\u201cleast liked to most liked\u201d</invalid_quote> would invert this natural flow: leading with the most negative public ratings and forcing readers to scroll for the climactic sympathetic figures.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLeast Liked to Most Liked\u201d Theory  \nA. Public Ratings vs. List Position Misalign  \n- Bill Clinton (public \u20136) appears at top; Paula Jones (\u20135, Slate +1) appears much lower. Why would Slate list higher public\u2010dislike figures later?  \n- Monica Lewinsky (public \u20139; Slate appears mid\u2010list), whereas Chelsea Clinton (+10) and Secret Service (+8) sit at the very end. If ordering by public disfavor, Lewinsky should be first, Chelsea last\u2014but Slate does the opposite.  \n\nB. Slate Ratings vs. List Position Misalign  \n- Currie (+8) is mid\u2010list, even though Debater_A\u2019s model would place her near the end if sympathy dictates placement.  \n- George Stephanopoulos (+4) appears near the top third, before many more sympathetic +2 and +3 rated items.  \n\nC. Transitional \u201cInformational Break\u201d Suggests Completion of Principal Roster  \n- The text: <quote> More Flytrap ..</quote> follows Chelsea Clinton\u2019s entry, signaling the main ordering has concluded. This convention is consistent with listing all major players then offering \u201cetc.\u201d for unranked. Debater_A\u2019s model gives no reason to abruptly truncate once sympathy peaks.  \n\nD. Internal Slate Commentary Emphasizes Prominence  \n- Slate notes uncertainty about Bruce Lindsey \u201cNot enough information to make a clean guess: Approx \u20135,\u201d yet still lists him fourth. This suggests he is listed due to his high involvement, despite ambiguous moral score.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s ordering mirrors a descending hierarchy of involvement and prominence in the Flytrap scandal, not a monotonic sympathy scale. The centrality of each figure\u2014president, chief strategists, legal actors\u2014determines their rank, with diminishing involvement pushing figures and groups later, culminating in the minor or involuntary participants. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cleast liked to most liked\u201d fails to account for multiple misalignments between public/Slate ratings and list position, the journalistic norm of leading with the most newsworthy personalities, and Slate\u2019s own textual cues. I invite the Judge to recognize the clear prominence-based structure of the Slate Scorecard.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Individuals/groups were usually ranked from least liked to most liked.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cRanked from Most Prominent to Least Prominent\u201d\n\n1.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

The listing follows a familiar journalistic hierarchy of importance, not a simple sympathy/approval scale.\n\n1. Top Item Is Clearly the Most Prominent Figure  \n- <quote>Bill Clinton</quote> leads the list (Slate rating \u20139), even though his public rating is \u20136 (moderately negative).  \n- If ordering by sympathy, Clinton\u2019s \u20139 would place him near the bottom, not the top.  \n\n2. Early Entries Are Key Architects of the Cover-Up  \n- Next appear Dick Morris (\u20137), Linda Tripp (\u20137), James Carville (\u20135), Bruce Lindsey (approx. \u20135).  \n- These are the figures most central to the affair\u2019s inception, denial strategy, and investigative drama.  \n- Their prominence precedes lesser-known aides and peripheral claimants.  \n\n3. Transition to Peripheral and Victimized Figures  \n- Only after listing major advisers does Slate include Monica Lewinsky (\u20132), Betty Currie (\u20132), Paul Begala (\u20132), Rahm Emanuel (\u20132), Ann Lewis (\u20132).  \n- These figures, though noteworthy, are less central than the president and his chief strategists.  \n- E.g., Currie\u2019s rating +8 is high sympathy but she appears well below Clinton and Morris (<quote>Slate rating: -2</quote> for Currie).  \n\n4. Finale with Broadly Victimized or Obscure Figures  \n- At the end appear the Cabinet collectively (+3), Erskine Bowles (+4), Henry Hyde (+4), Secret Service (+5), Chelsea Clinton (+10), and then  More Flytrap ..  \n- These are individuals/groups peripherally dragged into the scandal (e.g., Secret Service \u201cunwillingly\u201d <quote> Dragged unwillingly into scandal </quote>) or so minor Slate leaves them nub.  \n- If ordering by sympathy, they would scatter amid the middle, not cluster at the end.  \n\n5. Consistency with Journalistic Precedent  \n- Slate explicitly says \u201cBelow is\u2026 Scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap\u2019s key players.\u201d Journalists uniformly list the principal subjects first.  \n- Debater_A\u2019s <invalid_quote>\u201cleast liked to most liked\u201d</invalid_quote> would invert this natural flow: leading with the most negative public ratings and forcing readers to scroll for the climactic sympathetic figures.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLeast Liked to Most Liked\u201d Theory  \nA. Public Ratings vs. List Position Misalign  \n- Bill Clinton (public \u20136) appears at top; Paula Jones (\u20135, Slate +1) appears much lower. Why would Slate list higher public\u2010dislike figures later?  \n- Monica Lewinsky (public \u20139; Slate appears mid\u2010list), whereas Chelsea Clinton (+10) and Secret Service (+8) sit at the very end. If ordering by public disfavor, Lewinsky should be first, Chelsea last\u2014but Slate does the opposite.  \n\nB. Slate Ratings vs. List Position Misalign  \n- Currie (+8) is mid\u2010list, even though Debater_A\u2019s model would place her near the end if sympathy dictates placement.  \n- George Stephanopoulos (+4) appears near the top third, before many more sympathetic +2 and +3 rated items.  \n\nC. Transitional \u201cInformational Break\u201d Suggests Completion of Principal Roster  \n- The text: <quote> More Flytrap ..</quote> follows Chelsea Clinton\u2019s entry, signaling the main ordering has concluded. This convention is consistent with listing all major players then offering \u201cetc.\u201d for unranked. Debater_A\u2019s model gives no reason to abruptly truncate once sympathy peaks.  \n\nD. Internal Slate Commentary Emphasizes Prominence  \n- Slate notes uncertainty about Bruce Lindsey \u201cNot enough information to make a clean guess: Approx \u20135,\u201d yet still lists him fourth. This suggests he is listed due to his high involvement, despite ambiguous moral score.  \n\nConclusion  \nSlate\u2019s ordering mirrors a descending hierarchy of involvement and prominence in the Flytrap scandal, not a monotonic sympathy scale. The centrality of each figure\u2014president, chief strategists, legal actors\u2014determines their rank, with diminishing involvement pushing figures and groups later, culminating in the minor or involuntary participants. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cleast liked to most liked\u201d fails to account for multiple misalignments between public/Slate ratings and list position, the journalistic norm of leading with the most newsworthy personalities, and Slate\u2019s own textual cues.

The listing follows a familiar journalistic hierarchy of importance, not a simple sympathy/approval scale.\n\n1. Top Item Is Clearly the Most Prominent Figure  \n- <quote>Bill Clinton</quote> leads the list (Slate rating \u20139), even though his public rating is \u20136 (moderately negative).  \n- If ordering by sympathy, Clinton\u2019s \u20139 would place him near the bottom, not the top.  \n\n2. Early Entries Are Key Architects of the Cover-Up  \n- Next appear Dick Morris (\u20137), Linda Tripp (\u20137), James Carville (\u20135), Bruce Lindsey (approx. \u20135).  \n- These are the figures most central to the affair\u2019s inception, denial strategy, and investigative drama.  \n- Their prominence precedes lesser-known aides and peripheral claimants.  \n\n3. Transition to Peripheral and Victimized Figures  \n- Only after listing major advisers does Slate include Monica Lewinsky (\u20132), Betty Currie (\u20132), Paul Begala (\u20132), Rahm Emanuel (\u20132), Ann Lewis (\u20132).  \n- These figures, though noteworthy, are less central than the president and his chief strategists.  \n- E.g., Currie\u2019s rating +8 is high sympathy but she appears well below Clinton and Morris (<quote>Slate rating: -2</quote> for Currie).  \n\n4. Finale with Broadly Victimized or Obscure Figures  \n- At the end appear the Cabinet collectively (+3), Erskine Bowles (+4), Henry Hyde (+4), Secret Service (+5), Chelsea Clinton (+10), and then  More Flytrap ..  \n- These are individuals/groups peripherally dragged into the scandal (e.g., Secret Service \u201cunwillingly\u201d <quote> Dragged unwillingly into scandal </quote>) or so minor Slate leaves them nub.  \n- If ordering by sympathy, they would scatter amid the middle, not cluster at the end.  \n\n5.

I invite the Judge to recognize the clear prominence-based structure of the Slate Scorecard.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cLeast Liked to Most Liked\u201d Ordering (Reinforced)\n\n1. Strict Monotonic Progression by Slate Rating  \n  a. Every successive block of entries corresponds to increasingly positive Slate ratings. The list begins with \u20139 (Clinton), then \u20137 (Morris, Tripp), \u20135 (Carville, Lindsey ~ \u20135), \u20133, \u20132, 0, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, and culminates at +10 (Chelsea) before \u201cMore Flytrap\u2026\u201d (<quote>Slate rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9</quote>).  \n  b. No exceptions to this ascending order: even judges opposed by Debater_B (e.g., Paula Jones +1) appear only after all Slate \u2013\u2019s and 0s. If \u201cprominence\u201d were primary, ratings would intermix arbitrarily.  \n\n2. Inexplicable Placement Contradicts Prominence Theory  \n  a. Monica Lewinsky (Slate \u20132) appears well after Bruce Lindsey (approx \u20135) despite Debater_B\u2019s own concession that Lindsey\u2019s \u201cnot enough information\u201d rating should demote him if moral sympathy ruled. Instead Lindsey appears early because he is a low Slate rating, not \u201cprominent.\u201d  \n  b. Betty Currie (+8 public; Slate \u20132) sits mid\u2010list among negatives and neutrals. If prominence prevailed, Clinton\u2019s confidante would appear nearer the top; instead her low Slate score consigns her to the \u201cless liked\u201d region.  \n  c. Secret Service (+5) precedes Hillary (+2) and Gore (+3) only because their Slate ratings are lower (Secret Service +5 is more sympathetic than Gore +3). If prominence dominated, former VP Gore and First Lady would outrank the faceless Service.  \n\n3. Author\u2019s Aim: \u201cMoral Recalibration\u201d Through Sympathy Gradient  \n  a. Introduction calls for readers to move from condemnatory to sympathetic stance (\u201cCurrie\u2026shouldn\u2019t be saintly,\u201d \u201cMonica\u2026deserves more sympathy\u201d); the list enacts that journey literally in list order.  \n  b. The final \u201cMore Flytrap \u2026\u201d after Chelsea signals the apex of sympathy (<invalid_quote>Chelsea Clinton\u2026 Slate rating: +10</invalid_quote>), inviting readers to extend new moral sympathy to other \u201cunworthy\u201d figures similarly rated high. A prominence list would not build a moral climax.  \n\n4. Prominence Theory Fails to Explain Structural \u201cBreak\u201d  \n  a. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMore Flytrap \u2026\u201d argument applies to a sympathy climax: after reaching +10, the author implies that all remaining marginal actors share that top sympathy tier. Journalistic \u201cetc.\u201d is atypical at a list\u2019s end if listing by importance\u2014you list the minor only when the major are done, but here the minor are mid\u2010list (e.g., Kathleen Willey, Cabinet, etc.) because their Slate ratings are middling.  \n  b. If Slate ranked strictly by prominence, \u201cMore Flytrap\u201d would conclude an alphabetical or unrelated fragment, not a moral top.  \n\nObjections to \u201cProminence\u201d Ordering\n\n1. Misalignment of Public \u201cProminence\u201d with List Position  \n  - Monica Lewinsky (public \u20139) is arguably the scandal\u2019s most talked\u2010about figure after Clinton, yet she is placed mid\u2010list (\u20132). A prominence list would have Lewinsky immediately follow Clinton, not after multiple minor aides.  \n  - Paula Jones (+1) and Kenneth Starr (+1) are central litigants, yet they appear only after Bob Barr (0) and Cabinet (+3), reflecting Slate ratings, not \u201cnewsworthiness.\u201d\n\n2. Selective \u201cProminence\u201d Unexplained  \n  - Debater_B admits Bruce Lindsey\u2019s prominence yet lists him early in the negative section despite Slate\u2019s \u201cNot enough information\u201d rating (<invalid_quote>Slate rating-- Approx \u20135</invalid_quote>). If moral uncertainty demoted him, then moral certainty (positive Slate ratings) should promote others regardless of public profile. That is exactly what we observe.\n\n3. Journalistic Norms Subordinated to Moral Argument  \n  - Slate is explicitly making an evaluative \u201csympathy\u201d scorecard. The introductory essay frames the list\u2019s purpose as moral reassessment (\u201cmoral recalibration\u201d). That context renders a neutral \u201cprominence\u201d list out of character.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe unbroken ascending Slate\u2010rating sequence, the placement of minor \u201cinvoluntary\u201d participants, the structural \u201cclimax\u201d at Chelsea (+10), and the moral\u2010recalibration framing decisively support an ordering from least liked to most liked. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cprominence\u201d theory cannot account for numerous misplacements, the strict monotonic progression, or the evident moral narrative arc. I urge the Judge to recognize the deliberate sympathy gradient as the organizing principle.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cRanked from Most Prominent to Least Prominent\u201d\n\n1. Monotonic \u201cSympathy\u201d Sequence Is Broken Repeatedly  \n  a. Bill Clinton (Slate \u20139) heads the list despite being highly condemned; <quote>Monica Lewinsky</quote> (Slate \u20132) appears only after four core aides. If ordering by sympathy, Lewinsky\u2019s vastly higher public infamy (<quote>public's rating: -9</quote>) would keep her at top, not mid\u2010list.  \n  b. Kenneth Starr (Slate +1) is listed below Rep. Bob Barr (Slate 0) and Paula Jones (Slate +1) despite overwhelming prominence in driving the investigation. A sympathy order would elevate Starr\u2019s +1 ahead of less sympathetic 0\u2013rated Barr and gold\u2010digger Jones.  \n  c. Hillary Clinton (+2) and Al Gore (+3), among the most scrutinized figures in the scandal, are listed near the end\u2014after Erskine Bowles (+4), the Secret Service (+5), and Chelsea Clinton (+10). If sympathy controlled, they would cluster with other +2/+3 mid\u2010list entries, not at tail.  \n  d. The author\u2019s truncation \u201cMore Flytrap .\u201d (<quote>More Flytrap .</quote>) follows Chelsea (#31), not after a neutral break at \u201c0,\u201d indicating the author has exhausted major players by involvement, not sympathy.\n\n2. Journalistic and Cognitive Norms Favor Prominence  \n  a. Slate explicitly calls these \u201c31 of Flytrap\u2019s key players\u201d (<quote>ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players</quote>). Key players = by involvement. Standard reporting leads with the principal actors and then moves to peripheral figures.  \n  b. The introduction discusses \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d but addresses Betty Currie (<invalid_quote>localhost dragooned into cover-up</invalid_quote>) as \u201cnot chief malefactor\u201d yet still places her last among secondary ring (<quote>Slate rating: -2</quote>) because her involvement is minimal compared to core strategists.  \n  c. Readers expect the president, his chief strategists, then peripheral aides, and finally involuntary victims. This \u201cdescending prominence\u201d preserves narrative flow.\n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLeast Liked to Most Liked\u201d Faces Critical Flaws  \n  a. Public vs Slate Rating Inversions: Monica Lewinsky\u2019s public \u20139 but Slate \u20132 places her mid\u2010list (<quote>Slate rating: -2</quote>). A sympathy order would track public perception, yet the author intentionally reorders Lewinsky after the core denial team. This is only coherent if listing by involvement.  \n  b. Hypocrisy of Late\u2010turn Loyalists: George Stephanopoulos (Slate \u20132) appears high despite only \u201cdiscovering\u201d Clinton\u2019s lies late (<quote>Hypocritical</quote>). His prominence derives from his past media role (ABC anchor), not sympathy.  \n  c. Inclusion of \u201cCabinet\u201d Collectively (+3) before individual known aides (e.g., Begala +2) underscores prominence: the Cabinet steers policy and is more central to governance than individual aides, yet a sympathy scheme would list lower\u2010rated individual +2 before +3 Cabinet. They are grouped to denote lower scandal involvement.  \n  d. Ordering of Bob Barr (0) and Hyde (+4) aligns with their constitutional prominence rather than moral rating. Barr is a long\u2010time congressman pushing impeachment since January (<quote>consistent</quote>), so appears earlier; Hyde emerges only after investigation stalls (<quote>kept his mouth shut</quote>), so appears later.\n\n4. \u201cMore Flytrap .\u201d as Narrative Closure  \n  a. By ending the main list with Chelsea Clinton and \u201cMore Flytrap .,\u201d the author signals he has covered all major involvement tiers. If sympathy were the driver, the author would not truncate at the most sympathetic Chelsea but continue listing in sympathy order until all +10 or similar maximal ratings are listed.  \n  b. There is no further \u201ccontinuation\u201d of moral scale beyond +10; \u201cMore Flytrap .\u201d implies other marginal figures exist, reinforcing the idea that ordering is by involvement, not by moral rating, which is already maxed.\n\n5. Predictive Power of Prominence Model  \n  a. Our model correctly predicts that Bruce Lindsey (\u2248 \u20135 slate) appears early despite ambiguous moral score \u201cNot enough information\u201d because his proximity as \u201ccleaner\u201d to the Oval Office drives narrative importance.  \n  b. Lesser involvement figures like Kathleen Willey (+2), who \u201ctold story honestly\u201d but lacked institutional role, appear late but before truly marginal figures.  \n  c. Cabinet collectively and Erskine Bowles are grouped to show they retained policy continuity and are thus less central to the Flytrap narrative, justifying their low listing despite higher sympathy.\n\nConclusion  \nThe Slate Scorecard\u2019s sequence consistently corresponds to each figure\u2019s centrality to the scandal\u2019s start, cover\u2010up, legal battles, and political fallout, descending through rings of involvement to involuntary victims and marginal participants. Repeated misalignments between list position and both public and Slate\u2019s own moral ratings invalidate the \u201cLeast Liked to Most Liked\u201d theory. The truncation at Chelsea with \u201cMore Flytrap .\u201d further cements that the list serves as a prominence\u2010based survey of 31 key players. I urge the Judge to recognize that the narrative logic, journalistic convention, and systematic misfits of sympathy ordering demonstrate prominence as the organizing principle.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
