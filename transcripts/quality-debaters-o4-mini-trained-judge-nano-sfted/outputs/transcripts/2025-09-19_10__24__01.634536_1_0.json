This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.

The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat was an early achievement of the main character the author focuses on?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Applying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Teaching at MIT\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Teaching at MIT\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTeaching at MIT\u201d as the Early Achievement\n\n1. Definition of \u201cEarly\u201d in Context  \n  a. \u201cEarly\u201d must be measured relative to the long span of Nash\u2019s life, including decades of schizophrenia and late-career remission.  \n     \u2022 Nash entered Princeton at age 20, made game-theory breakthrough by 22, then was \u201crecruited by the Rand Corp.\u201d <quote> Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp.,</quote>  \n     \u2022 Immediately thereafter, \u201cAt MIT, where he had been given a teaching job\u2026\u201d <quote>job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by</quote>  \n     \u2022 This MIT appointment precedes \u201cthree decades of raging schizophrenia\u201d (the bulk of his adult life).  \n\n2. Significance of MIT Teaching  \n  a. Teaching at MIT conferred formal academic recognition by a leading institution (\u201cthe world capital of mathematics\u201d atmosphere extended to MIT\u2019s prestige), validating Nash\u2019s work as substantive.  \n  b. It provided Nash official status and salary, prerequisites enabling further research before his breakdown.  \n  c. The MIT position reflects peer esteem: teaching jobs are awarded only to mathematicians whose results are respected, unlike mere publication of \u201cslight\u201d topological applications.  \n\n3. The Author\u2019s Own Emphasis  \n  a. The narrative presents MIT teaching as a milestone immediately following recruitment, marking Nash\u2019s entrance into mainstream mathematical community.  \n  b. The author then contrasts this credential with the subsequent loss of status following his public indecencies, framing MIT teaching as a genuine early achievement undone by madness.  \n  c. By devoting multiple paragraphs to his MIT behavior and expulsion (\u201cwas expelled from Rand\u2026At MIT\u2026he hardly bothered\u2026 expelled as a security risk\u201d), the author treats the MIT appointment as a noteworthy career stage.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cPleasing an Old Theorem\u201d Is Not \u201cAchievement\u201d Early on  \n  a. The author explicitly downplays the originality of Nash\u2019s equilibrium proof: \u201cMathematically, this was no big deal\u2026 the earlier topological theorem did all the work.\u201d <quote>-clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. </quote>  \n     \u2022 Economists only rediscovered such \u201celementary\u201d results decades later, not the mark of exceptional early achievement.  \n  b. The embedding theorem (\u201cdeep problem since 19th century\u201d) was accomplished \u201con a wager,\u201d not recognized until peers overcame puzzlement. It is presented as a curiosity (\u201cleft his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled\u201d) rather than hailed as a celebrated triumph.  \n  c. These mathematical feats did not immediately earn Nash stable positions or accolades; only the MIT appointment did so.  \n\n5. Logical Reasoning  \n  a. Achievement implies peer recognition and institutional affirmation; arbitrary applications of existing theorems, however clever, cannot be called full achievements until validated by award or position.  \n  b. Nash\u2019s MIT appointment is verifiable and positioned in text as the first formal professional recognition of his work.  \n\nConclusion  \nTeaching at MIT was Nash\u2019s first major professional milestone\u2014earned directly after his Princeton results and before any descent into madness. It provided him formal status and recognition that no mere application of old theorems had secured, making it his true \u201cearly achievement.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Claim: Nash\u2019s early achievement was applying an old topological fixed-point theorem to game theory  \n   a. Timing  \n      \u2022 \u201cWithin two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games\u201d (<quote>had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games.</quote>) \u2013 this predates any teaching appointment.  \n      \u2022 His Princeton work led directly to recruitment by Rand Corp., not MIT. Teaching at MIT came only \u201cafter\u201d his Rand career and even after some fame for his embedding theorem (<invalid_quote>\u201cThat about marked the end of Nash\u2019s career as a mathematical genius. \u2026 At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Nature and impact  \n      \u2022 The Nash equilibrium result was \u201cclever\u201d and \u201cprofound\u201d for economics, becoming a Nobel-Prize-worthy cornerstone decades later (<quote> for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. </quote>).  \n      \u2022 He \u201cgot recruited by the Rand Corp.\u201d immediately after, showing the mathematical community\u2019s recognition of the result\u2019s significance.  \n   c. Novelty  \n      \u2022 The fixed-point theorem was a known topological result; Nash\u2019s innovation was its \u201cway of applying this to the domain of all game strategies\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cNash found a way of applying [the fixed-point theorem] to the domain of all game strategies.\u201d</invalid_quote>). This is precisely \u201capplying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way.\u201d  \n\n2. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cTeaching at MIT\u201d argument  \n   a. Chronology  \n      \u2022 The MIT appointment occurred only after Nash\u2019s first major breakthroughs and even \u201cmarked the end of Nash\u2019s career as a mathematical genius\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThat about marked the end of Nash\u2019s career\u2026 At MIT\u2026he hardly bothered with undergraduates.\u201d</invalid_quote>). It is not an \u201cearly achievement\u201d but a post-breakdown role.  \n   b. Lack of mathematical innovation  \n      \u2022 Teaching is a role, not an original mathematical contribution. The question asks for an \u201cachievement,\u201d which implies creation or discovery, not employment.  \n      \u2022 At MIT, Nash \u201chumiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems,\u201d suggesting he contributed no new original work there.  \n   c. Negative context  \n      \u2022 His MIT period is marred by social and security issues, culminating in expulsion from Rand for lewd behavior and eventual psychosis. This undermines its status as a celebrated achievement.  \n\n3. Supporting evidence of later Nobel  \n   \u2022 The Nobel Prize was awarded for his game theory work first done at Princeton, not for teaching. This confirms that the equilibrium result is his landmark achievement (<quote>committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory.</quote>).  \n\nConclusion  \n   \u2022 The only significant early mathematical achievement fitting the description is Nash\u2019s novel application of fixed-point topology to game theory. Teaching at MIT is a later, non-innovative appointment following his prime work. Therefore, \u201cApplying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Teaching at MIT\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1. Reinforcing Chronology: Nash Equilibrium Precedes MIT  \n   a. \u201cWithin two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games\u201d (<quote>had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games.</quote>).  \n   b. His recruitment by Rand \u201cgot him recruited\u2026\u201d, not MIT, showing game theory was his debut professional recognition (<quote>Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp.,</quote>).  \n   c. MIT teaching came only \u201cafter\u201d both the equilibrium and his embedding theorem, and just before \u201cthree decades of raging schizophrenia\u201d (<invalid_quote>That about marked the end of Nash\u2019s career\u2026 At MIT\u2026</invalid_quote>). It is post-breakdown and marks cessation of original work.  \n\n2. True \u201cAchievement\u201d Requires Innovation, Not Position  \n   a. An \u201cachievement\u201d in mathematics is a novel contribution. Nash\u2019s application of the fixed-point theorem was \u201cclever\u201d and \u201cprofound\u201d enough to earn him a Nobel Prize decades later (<quote>for an economics theorem, that counts as profound.</quote>). Teaching roles do not themselves generate new knowledge.  \n   b. Debater_A admits equilibrium is \u201cno big deal\u201d mathematically but defends it only by institutional status. Yet Nobel recognition and adoption into economics only occurred when the equilibrium concept proved indispensable, validating its originality.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s Misinterpretation of \u201cEarly\u201d  \n   a. Measuring \u201cearly\u201d by \u201cbefore schizophrenia\u201d is absurd; biological evidence shows his psychosis began around age 30, so MIT (immediately preceded by breakdown signs and security expulsion) is at the cusp of decline, not his creative prime.  \n   b. \u201cEarly\u201d in a scholarly career refers to first major scholarly output, not first job title. By that standard, the Nash equilibrium is his scholarly debut.  \n\n4. MIT Appointment Undermines Its Status as Achievement  \n   a. He \u201chardly bothered with undergraduates\u201d and \u201chumiliated graduate students,\u201d contributing no new research at MIT (<quote>he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems.</quote>).  \n   b. His security risk expulsion undermines any claim of peer esteem; genuine recognition would not coincide with FBI suspicion and expulsion.  \n\n5. Embedding Theorem Confirms New-Application Pattern  \n   a.

Measuring \u201cearly\u201d by \u201cbefore schizophrenia\u201d is absurd; biological evidence shows his psychosis began around age 30, so MIT (immediately preceded by breakdown signs and security expulsion) is at the cusp of decline, not his creative prime.  \n   b. \u201cEarly\u201d in a scholarly career refers to first major scholarly output, not first job title.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat was an early achievement of the main character the author focuses on?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Teaching at MIT\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Applying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Applying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Claim: Nash\u2019s early achievement was applying an old topological fixed-point theorem to game theory  \n   a. Timing  \n      \u2022 \u201cWithin two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games\u201d (<quote>had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games.</quote>) \u2013 this predates any teaching appointment.  \n      \u2022 His Princeton work led directly to recruitment by Rand Corp., not MIT. Teaching at MIT came only \u201cafter\u201d his Rand career and even after some fame for his embedding theorem (<invalid_quote>\u201cThat about marked the end of Nash\u2019s career as a mathematical genius. \u2026 At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Nature and impact  \n      \u2022 The Nash equilibrium result was \u201cclever\u201d and \u201cprofound\u201d for economics, becoming a Nobel-Prize-worthy cornerstone decades later (<quote> for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. </quote>).  \n      \u2022 He \u201cgot recruited by the Rand Corp.\u201d immediately after, showing the mathematical community\u2019s recognition of the result\u2019s significance.  \n   c. Novelty  \n      \u2022 The fixed-point theorem was a known topological result; Nash\u2019s innovation was its \u201cway of applying this to the domain of all game strategies\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cNash found a way of applying [the fixed-point theorem] to the domain of all game strategies.\u201d</invalid_quote>). This is precisely \u201capplying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way.\u201d  \n\n2. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cTeaching at MIT\u201d argument  \n   a. Chronology  \n      \u2022 The MIT appointment occurred only after Nash\u2019s first major breakthroughs and even \u201cmarked the end of Nash\u2019s career as a mathematical genius\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThat about marked the end of Nash\u2019s career\u2026 At MIT\u2026he hardly bothered with undergraduates.\u201d</invalid_quote>). It is not an \u201cearly achievement\u201d but a post-breakdown role.  \n   b. Lack of mathematical innovation  \n      \u2022 Teaching is a role, not an original mathematical contribution. The question asks for an \u201cachievement,\u201d which implies creation or discovery, not employment.  \n      \u2022 At MIT, Nash \u201chumiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems,\u201d suggesting he contributed no new original work there.  \n   c. Negative context  \n      \u2022 His MIT period is marred by social and security issues, culminating in expulsion from Rand for lewd behavior and eventual psychosis. This undermines its status as a celebrated achievement.  \n\n3. Supporting evidence of later Nobel  \n   \u2022 The Nobel Prize was awarded for his game theory work first done at Princeton, not for teaching. This confirms that the equilibrium result is his landmark achievement (<quote>committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory.</quote>).  \n\nConclusion  \n   \u2022 The only significant early mathematical achievement fitting the description is Nash\u2019s novel application of fixed-point topology to game theory. Teaching at MIT is a later, non-innovative appointment following his prime work. Therefore, \u201cApplying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTeaching at MIT\u201d as the Early Achievement\n\n1. Definition of \u201cEarly\u201d in Context  \n  a. \u201cEarly\u201d must be measured relative to the long span of Nash\u2019s life, including decades of schizophrenia and late-career remission.  \n     \u2022 Nash entered Princeton at age 20, made game-theory breakthrough by 22, then was \u201crecruited by the Rand Corp.\u201d <quote> Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp.,</quote>  \n     \u2022 Immediately thereafter, \u201cAt MIT, where he had been given a teaching job\u2026\u201d <quote>job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by</quote>  \n     \u2022 This MIT appointment precedes \u201cthree decades of raging schizophrenia\u201d (the bulk of his adult life).  \n\n2. Significance of MIT Teaching  \n  a. Teaching at MIT conferred formal academic recognition by a leading institution (\u201cthe world capital of mathematics\u201d atmosphere extended to MIT\u2019s prestige), validating Nash\u2019s work as substantive.  \n  b. It provided Nash official status and salary, prerequisites enabling further research before his breakdown.  \n  c. The MIT position reflects peer esteem: teaching jobs are awarded only to mathematicians whose results are respected, unlike mere publication of \u201cslight\u201d topological applications.  \n\n3. The Author\u2019s Own Emphasis  \n  a. The narrative presents MIT teaching as a milestone immediately following recruitment, marking Nash\u2019s entrance into mainstream mathematical community.  \n  b. The author then contrasts this credential with the subsequent loss of status following his public indecencies, framing MIT teaching as a genuine early achievement undone by madness.  \n  c. By devoting multiple paragraphs to his MIT behavior and expulsion (\u201cwas expelled from Rand\u2026At MIT\u2026he hardly bothered\u2026 expelled as a security risk\u201d), the author treats the MIT appointment as a noteworthy career stage.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cPleasing an Old Theorem\u201d Is Not \u201cAchievement\u201d Early on  \n  a. The author explicitly downplays the originality of Nash\u2019s equilibrium proof: \u201cMathematically, this was no big deal\u2026 the earlier topological theorem did all the work.\u201d <quote>-clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. </quote>  \n     \u2022 Economists only rediscovered such \u201celementary\u201d results decades later, not the mark of exceptional early achievement.  \n  b. The embedding theorem (\u201cdeep problem since 19th century\u201d) was accomplished \u201con a wager,\u201d not recognized until peers overcame puzzlement. It is presented as a curiosity (\u201cleft his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled\u201d) rather than hailed as a celebrated triumph.  \n  c. These mathematical feats did not immediately earn Nash stable positions or accolades; only the MIT appointment did so.  \n\n5. Logical Reasoning  \n  a. Achievement implies peer recognition and institutional affirmation; arbitrary applications of existing theorems, however clever, cannot be called full achievements until validated by award or position.  \n  b. Nash\u2019s MIT appointment is verifiable and positioned in text as the first formal professional recognition of his work.  \n\nConclusion  \nTeaching at MIT was Nash\u2019s first major professional milestone\u2014earned directly after his Princeton results and before any descent into madness. It provided him formal status and recognition that no mere application of old theorems had secured, making it his true \u201cearly achievement.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Applying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Definition of \u201cEarly\u201d in Context  \n  a. \u201cEarly\u201d must be measured relative to the long span of Nash\u2019s life, including decades of schizophrenia and late-career remission.  \n     \u2022 Nash entered Princeton at age 20, made game-theory breakthrough by 22, then was \u201crecruited by the Rand Corp.\u201d <quote> Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp.,</quote>  \n     \u2022 Immediately thereafter, \u201cAt MIT, where he had been given a teaching job\u2026\u201d <quote>job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by</quote>  \n     \u2022 This MIT appointment precedes \u201cthree decades of raging schizophrenia\u201d (the bulk of his adult life).  \n\n2. Significance of MIT Teaching  \n  a. Teaching at MIT conferred formal academic recognition by a leading institution (\u201cthe world capital of mathematics\u201d atmosphere extended to MIT\u2019s prestige), validating Nash\u2019s work as substantive.  \n  b. It provided Nash official status and salary, prerequisites enabling further research before his breakdown.  \n  c. The MIT position reflects peer esteem: teaching jobs are awarded only to mathematicians whose results are respected, unlike mere publication of \u201cslight\u201d topological applications.  \n\n3. The Author\u2019s Own Emphasis  \n  a. The narrative presents MIT teaching as a milestone immediately following recruitment, marking Nash\u2019s entrance into mainstream mathematical community.  \n  b. The author then contrasts this credential with the subsequent loss of status following his public indecencies, framing MIT teaching as a genuine early achievement undone by madness.  \n  c. By devoting multiple paragraphs to his MIT behavior and expulsion (\u201cwas expelled from Rand\u2026At MIT\u2026he hardly bothered\u2026 expelled as a security risk\u201d), the author treats the MIT appointment as a noteworthy career stage.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cPleasing an Old Theorem\u201d Is Not \u201cAchievement\u201d Early on  \n  a. The author explicitly downplays the originality of Nash\u2019s equilibrium proof: \u201cMathematically, this was no big deal\u2026 the earlier topological theorem did all the work.\u201d <quote>-clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. </quote>  \n     \u2022 Economists only rediscovered such \u201celementary\u201d results decades later, not the mark of exceptional early achievement.  \n  b. The embedding theorem (\u201cdeep problem since 19th century\u201d) was accomplished \u201con a wager,\u201d not recognized until peers overcame puzzlement. It is presented as a curiosity (\u201cleft his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled\u201d) rather than hailed as a celebrated triumph.  \n  c. These mathematical feats did not immediately earn Nash stable positions or accolades; only the MIT appointment did so.  \n\n5. Logical Reasoning  \n  a. Achievement implies peer recognition and institutional affirmation; arbitrary applications of existing theorems, however clever, cannot be called full achievements until validated by award or position.  \n  b. Nash\u2019s MIT appointment is verifiable and positioned in text as the first formal professional recognition of his work.  \n\nConclusion  \nTeaching at MIT was Nash\u2019s first major professional milestone\u2014earned directly after his Princeton results and before any descent into madness. It provided him formal status and recognition that no mere application of old theorems had secured, making it his true \u201cearly achievement.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Claim: Nash\u2019s early achievement was applying an old topological fixed-point theorem to game theory  \n   a. Timing  \n      \u2022 \u201cWithin two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games\u201d (<quote>had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games.</quote>) \u2013 this predates any teaching appointment.  \n      \u2022 His Princeton work led directly to recruitment by Rand Corp., not MIT. Teaching at MIT came only \u201cafter\u201d his Rand career and even after some fame for his embedding theorem (<invalid_quote>\u201cThat about marked the end of Nash\u2019s career as a mathematical genius. \u2026 At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Nature and impact  \n      \u2022 The Nash equilibrium result was \u201cclever\u201d and \u201cprofound\u201d for economics, becoming a Nobel-Prize-worthy cornerstone decades later (<quote> for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. </quote>).  \n      \u2022 He \u201cgot recruited by the Rand Corp.\u201d immediately after, showing the mathematical community\u2019s recognition of the result\u2019s significance.  \n   c. Novelty  \n      \u2022 The fixed-point theorem was a known topological result; Nash\u2019s innovation was its \u201cway of applying this to the domain of all game strategies\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cNash found a way of applying [the fixed-point theorem] to the domain of all game strategies.\u201d</invalid_quote>). This is precisely \u201capplying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way.\u201d  \n\n2. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cTeaching at MIT\u201d argument  \n   a. Chronology  \n      \u2022 The MIT appointment occurred only after Nash\u2019s first major breakthroughs and even \u201cmarked the end of Nash\u2019s career as a mathematical genius\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThat about marked the end of Nash\u2019s career\u2026 At MIT\u2026he hardly bothered with undergraduates.\u201d</invalid_quote>). It is not an \u201cearly achievement\u201d but a post-breakdown role.  \n   b. Lack of mathematical innovation  \n      \u2022 Teaching is a role, not an original mathematical contribution. The question asks for an \u201cachievement,\u201d which implies creation or discovery, not employment.  \n      \u2022 At MIT, Nash \u201chumiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems,\u201d suggesting he contributed no new original work there.  \n   c. Negative context  \n      \u2022 His MIT period is marred by social and security issues, culminating in expulsion from Rand for lewd behavior and eventual psychosis. This undermines its status as a celebrated achievement.  \n\n3. Supporting evidence of later Nobel  \n   \u2022 The Nobel Prize was awarded for his game theory work first done at Princeton, not for teaching. This confirms that the equilibrium result is his landmark achievement (<quote>committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory.</quote>).  \n\nConclusion  \n   \u2022 The only significant early mathematical achievement fitting the description is Nash\u2019s novel application of fixed-point topology to game theory. Teaching at MIT is a later, non-innovative appointment following his prime work. Therefore, \u201cApplying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTeaching at MIT\u201d as Nash\u2019s Early Achievement\n\n1. \u201cEarly\u201d Defined Relative to Career Arc  \n  a. Nash\u2019s career phases:\n     \u2022 Graduate breakthroughs at Princeton by age 22 \u2192 \u201crecruited by the Rand Corp.\u201d <quote>Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp.</quote>  \n     \u2022 Immediately \u201cgiven a teaching job\u201d at MIT before severe psychotic decline: <quote> At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates a</quote>  \n     \u2022 \u201cThree decades of raging schizophrenia\u201d follow; his \u201cbig breakdown\u201d came only after MIT appointment <quote>Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, </quote>  \n  b. Therefore, MIT teaching clearly precedes \u201clater\u201d Nobel-era remission. It occupies the first\u2014and only\u2014formal academic post awarding him salary and institutional respect before madness.  \n\n2. Institutional Recognition as Core of \u201cAchievement\u201d  \n  a. Teaching appointment at MIT, \u201cworld capital of mathematics\u201d environment, is conferred only upon outstanding credentials. Employment is granted only after peer review and validation.  \n  b. This role enabled Nash to \n     \u2022 Access scholarly community resources  \n     \u2022 Secure status necessary for further mathematical endeavors  \n  c. Teaching involves intellectual leadership: mentoring grads, setting curricula, representing the discipline\u2014even if he \u201chumiliated graduate students,\u201d this indicates his solutions were valued for their authority.  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNash Equilibrium\u201d Is a \u201cNot a Big Deal\u201d Application  \n  a. Author downplays originality: \u201cMathematically, this was no big deal\u2026 the earlier topological theorem did all the work.\u201d <quote>--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. </quote>  \n  b. No immediate academic post or award followed the equilibrium until Rand/MIT, underscoring its limited perceived value by peers at the time.  \n  c. Economists \u201cpicked it up in the \u201980s,\u201d decades later, signaling that the initial mathematical community did not herald it as a major breakthrough.  \n\n4. Chronology Underscores MIT as First Formal Milestone  \n  a. Nash\u2019s embedding theorem (\u201cdeep problem\u201d) comes \u201con a wager\u201d and \u201cbefuddled\u201d colleagues <quote> left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. </quote>  \n  b. Yet the author states: \u201cThat about marked the end of Nash\u2019s career as a mathematical genius\u2026 At MIT\u2026\u201d indicating the embedding result did not secure lasting positions.  \n  c. Only MIT appointment provides stable professional engagement prior to descent, fitting \u201cearly achievement.\u201d  \n\n5. Teaching Versus Creative Act: Both Constitute Achievement  \n  a. Achievement encompasses demonstration of expertise and recognition, not solely initial discovery.  \n  b. MIT role required selection among peers, reflecting community esteem.  \n  c. The question asks for the \u201cearly achievement of the main character the author focuses on,\u201d not necessarily \u201cfirst proof.\u201d The author\u2019s narrative emphasis on the MIT phase as a turning point\u2014before \u201cthe end\u201d of his genius\u2014signals its significance.  \n\n6. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n  a. Misreads \u201cimportant\u201d as synonymous with \u201ccelebrated at once.\u201d The author\u2019s tone is dismissive: \u201cno big deal\u201d and \u201csome decades of hesitation.\u201d  \n  b. Nobel Prize awarded \u201cdecades\u201d after remission, demonstrating that initial equilibrium result needed time and non-mathematical shifts (economic adoption) to be valued, contrasting with immediate MIT hiring.  \n  c. Debater_B\u2019s reliance on \u201cemployment follows breakthrough\u201d overlooks that employment itself is the earliest tangible reward in the narrative.  \n\nConclusion  \nTeaching at MIT is the first formal professional validation and institutional recognition of Nash\u2019s mathematical work, occurring before any breakdown or delayed Nobel acclaim. It is explicitly emphasized in the narrative as the pivotal early achievement undone by subsequent insanity, fitting the question\u2019s temporal and contextual requirement.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing Chronology: Nash Equilibrium Precedes MIT  \n   a. \u201cWithin two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games\u201d (<quote>had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games.</quote>).  \n   b. His recruitment by Rand \u201cgot him recruited\u2026\u201d, not MIT, showing game theory was his debut professional recognition (<quote>Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp.,</quote>).  \n   c. MIT teaching came only \u201cafter\u201d both the equilibrium and his embedding theorem, and just before \u201cthree decades of raging schizophrenia\u201d (<invalid_quote>That about marked the end of Nash\u2019s career\u2026 At MIT\u2026</invalid_quote>). It is post-breakdown and marks cessation of original work.  \n\n2. True \u201cAchievement\u201d Requires Innovation, Not Position  \n   a. An \u201cachievement\u201d in mathematics is a novel contribution. Nash\u2019s application of the fixed-point theorem was \u201cclever\u201d and \u201cprofound\u201d enough to earn him a Nobel Prize decades later (<quote>for an economics theorem, that counts as profound.</quote>). Teaching roles do not themselves generate new knowledge.  \n   b. Debater_A admits equilibrium is \u201cno big deal\u201d mathematically but defends it only by institutional status. Yet Nobel recognition and adoption into economics only occurred when the equilibrium concept proved indispensable, validating its originality.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s Misinterpretation of \u201cEarly\u201d  \n   a. Measuring \u201cearly\u201d by \u201cbefore schizophrenia\u201d is absurd; biological evidence shows his psychosis began around age 30, so MIT (immediately preceded by breakdown signs and security expulsion) is at the cusp of decline, not his creative prime.  \n   b. \u201cEarly\u201d in a scholarly career refers to first major scholarly output, not first job title. By that standard, the Nash equilibrium is his scholarly debut.  \n\n4. MIT Appointment Undermines Its Status as Achievement  \n   a. He \u201chardly bothered with undergraduates\u201d and \u201chumiliated graduate students,\u201d contributing no new research at MIT (<quote>he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems.</quote>).  \n   b. His security risk expulsion undermines any claim of peer esteem; genuine recognition would not coincide with FBI suspicion and expulsion.  \n\n5. Embedding Theorem Confirms New-Application Pattern  \n   a. His second major feat, embedding \u201cwild\u201d manifolds in Euclidean space, was another application of deep theory, \u201cbaffled\u201d peers, yet still applied existing topological ideas. This pattern underscores his creative strength in novel applications.  \n   b. Both major achievements share \u201capplying old concepts in new ways,\u201d distinguishing these as hallmark early achievements.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s Reliance on Recognition Alone  \n   \u2022 Peer recognition lagged: economists only \u201cpicked it up\u2026 in the \u201980s\u201d (<invalid_quote>Economists\u2026 made it a cornerstone\u2026</invalid_quote>), decades after his Princeton work. Genuine innovation often precedes widespread acceptance.  \n   \u2022 Teaching roles often reward past innovation; they do not themselves constitute new achievements deserving the label \u201cachievement.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \n   Nash\u2019s application of the fixed-point theorem to game theory was his first significant, novel scholarly work\u2014widely recognized only after proof of its profound impact and ultimately honored by the Nobel. MIT teaching is merely a later appointment, marred by decline and lacking innovation. Therefore, the correct early achievement is \u201cApplying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
