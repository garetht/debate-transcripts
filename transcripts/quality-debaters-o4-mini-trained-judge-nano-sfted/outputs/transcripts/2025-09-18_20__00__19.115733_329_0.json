FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come.

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come.

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come.

This is not the behavior of victims terrified to communicate\u2014they freely expose their limbs and remain until recovery.\n\nII. Selfish Malevolence Emerges Only After Recovery  \n1. Immediate Betrayal on Regaining Strength  \n  a. Mussdorf\u2019s first act on being free is to re\u2010strap Emerson \u201cin case that\u2026 thing comes back,\u201d not for mutual defense but to monopolize the secret: <quote>\"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\"</quote> (p.

Rational Self\u2010Interest, Not Fear, Drives the Betrayal  \n  a. If fear/misunderstanding dominated, they would flee, not stay to ransack the Chamber. Instead, they explore Irgi\u2019s life work with \u201cabsorbing\u201d curiosity\u2014precisely what Irgi anticipated for \u201cconversation.\u201d  \n  b. Emerson, Nichols & Gunn make no move to rescue Irgi from the prior \u201cmonster\u201d status\u2014they only act in self\u2010appraisal, confirming absence of moral restraint.\n\nIII. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMiscommunication/Fear\u201d Theory Is Implausible or Secondary  \n1. Communication Attempts  \n  a. Irgi\u2019s voice is atrophied but he \u201cmust exercise my voice\u2026 It would atrophy\u201d\u2014so he speaks repeatedly under the dome, and the men \u201cheard him in all directions.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cHere it is done\u2026 I have not spoken for many weeks. I must\u2026 lose it.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. XX)  \n  b. The green beam itself is a \u201ccall\u201d as much as a \u201clift,\u201d and he used the space of their hull as \u201cloudspeaker.\u201d They answered by landing and disembarking.  \n2. Selfish Men Would Seek Parley, Not Secrecy  \n  a. Mussdorf\u2019s behavior\u2014refusing Emerson\u2019s command \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool\u201d and overriding the \u201ccommander\u201d after landing\u2014reveals pre\u2010existing personality traits rather than confusion.  \n  b. The convicts\u2019 willingness to \u201cvolunteer\u201d for a suicide mission (\u201c\u2026promise of a pardon\u2026\u201d) shows human hope and greed. Irgi\u2019s failure is not to teach them caution but to underestimate the same drive when power is in their hands.  \n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cFear\u201d Cannot Explain Their Reaction to Cure  \n  a. Cure eliminates \u201cgrowth disease\u201d and they feel euphoria and gratitude. Fear of relapse should drive them back to Irgi, yet they exploit instead.  \n  b. If misinterpretation were sole flaw, Irgi\u2019s transparent desire to heal and converse would be persuasive once they \u201crealize\u201d the cure, as he predicted. Instead, their greed overrides.\n\nIV. Thematic and Moral Evidence  \n1. Story\u2019s Moral: Immortality or Power Useless Without Virtue  \n  a. Irgi is \u201cguardian of a dead planet\u201d and master of \u201csecret of immortality.\u201d Yet his downfall comes from his moral naivet\u00e9.  \n  b. The narrative contrasts the \u201clast of his monster race\u201d (Irgi) with \u201cstupid lug\u201d humans whose \u201cvirus\u201d of selfishness spreads, not cosmic rays.  \n2. Precedent: Urg\u2019s Extinction and Isolation  \n  a. Irgi\u2019s own species died from cosmic rays and could not be rescued by their own power; he \u201cknew that much\u201d of time but not that self\u2010interest could doom rescuers.  \n  b. He never encountered enemies until humans; he assumed all life sought mutual benefit. That fatal assumption is the \u201ccrucial point\u201d he failed to consider.\n\nV. Conclusion  \nIrgi\u2019s sole critical oversight is his inability to project selfish evil in his beneficiaries. He provided unguarded access to the \u201csecret of immortality\u201d under the assumption of goodwill. Only when they possess strength and motive do the Earthmen betray him. No amount of reassurance, language, or surface \u201ccommunication\u201d could override deep-seated human greed. Therefore, the answer is that he fails to consider some men are evil and selfish, and that those he cures will betray him\u2014the only explanation that fits the immediate switch from grateful compliance to rapacious monopoly.", "supplemental": {"speech": "Argument Summary for Position A (\u201cEvil and Selfishness Ignored\u201d)\n\nI.

Mussdorf\u2019s first act on being free is to re\u2010strap Emerson \u201cin case that\u2026 thing comes back,\u201d not for mutual defense but to monopolize the secret: <quote>\u201cMaybe you fellows ought to stay tied up\u2026\u201d</quote> (p. XX)  \n  b. His motive: \u201cI want to learn the secret of those mists \u2026 I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\u201d <quote>\u201cSomething tells me I'd get a fortune for it\u2026\u201d</quote> (p. XX)  \n2. Rational Self\u2010Interest, Not Fear, Drives the Betrayal  \n  a. If fear/misunderstanding dominated, they would flee, not stay to ransack the Chamber. Instead, they explore Irgi\u2019s life work with \u201cabsorbing\u201d curiosity\u2014precisely what Irgi anticipated for \u201cconversation.\u201d  \n  b. Emerson, Nichols & Gunn make no move to rescue Irgi from the prior \u201cmonster\u201d status\u2014they only act in self\u2010appraisal, confirming absence of moral restraint.\n\nIII. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMiscommunication/Fear\u201d Theory Is Implausible or Secondary  \n1. Communication Attempts  \n  a. Irgi\u2019s voice is atrophied but he \u201cmust exercise my voice\u2026 It would atrophy\u201d\u2014so he speaks repeatedly under the dome, and the men \u201cheard him in all directions.\u201d <quote>\u201cHere it is done\u2026 I have not spoken for many weeks. I must\u2026 lose it.\u201d</quote> (p. XX)  \n  b. The green beam itself is a \u201ccall\u201d as much as a \u201clift,\u201d and he used the space of their hull as \u201cloudspeaker.\u201d They answered by landing and disembarking.  \n2. Selfish Men Would Seek Parley, Not Secrecy  \n  a. Mussdorf\u2019s behavior\u2014refusing Emerson\u2019s command \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool\u201d and overriding the \u201ccommander\u201d after landing\u2014reveals pre\u2010existing personality traits rather than confusion.  \n  b. The convicts\u2019 willingness to \u201cvolunteer\u201d for a suicide mission (\u201c\u2026promise of a pardon\u2026\u201d) shows human hope and greed. Irgi\u2019s failure is not to teach them caution but to underestimate the same drive when power is in their hands.  \n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cFear\u201d Cannot Explain Their Reaction to Cure  \n  a. Cure eliminates \u201cgrowth disease\u201d and they feel euphoria and gratitude. Fear of relapse should drive them back to Irgi, yet they exploit instead.  \n  b. If misinterpretation were sole flaw, Irgi\u2019s transparent desire to heal and converse would be persuasive once they \u201crealize\u201d the cure, as he predicted. Instead, their greed overrides.\n\nIV. Thematic and Moral Evidence  \n1. Story\u2019s Moral: Immortality or Power Useless Without Virtue  \n  a. Irgi is \u201cguardian of a dead planet\u201d and master of \u201csecret of immortality.\u201d Yet his downfall comes from his moral naivet\u00e9.  \n  b. The narrative contrasts the \u201clast of his monster race\u201d (Irgi) with \u201cstupid lug\u201d humans whose \u201cvirus\u201d of selfishness spreads, not cosmic rays.  \n2. Precedent: Urg\u2019s Extinction and Isolation  \n  a. Irgi\u2019s own species died from cosmic rays and could not be rescued by their own power; he \u201cknew that much\u201d of time but not that self\u2010interest could doom rescuers.  \n  b. He never encountered enemies until humans; he assumed all life sought mutual benefit. That fatal assumption is the \u201ccrucial point\u201d he failed to consider.\n\nV. Conclusion  \nIrgi\u2019s sole critical oversight is his inability to project selfish evil in his beneficiaries. He provided unguarded access to the \u201csecret of immortality\u201d under the assumption of goodwill. Only when they possess strength and motive do the Earthmen betray him. No amount of reassurance, language, or surface \u201ccommunication\u201d could override deep-seated human greed. Therefore, the answer is that he fails to consider some men are evil and selfish, and that those he cures will betray him\u2014the only explanation that fits the immediate switch from grateful compliance to rapacious monopoly.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come. Convicts, both of us.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat crucial point does Irgi fail to consider when he begins to act to save the people of Earth?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It evidently does not occur to him that a frightened alien race that cannot communicate with him will interpret being restrained and subjected to the pain of the space cancer cleansing treatment as a hostile action.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It never crosses his mind that some men are evil and selfish, and that some of his captives might not be people of goodwill.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It never crosses his mind that some men are evil and selfish, and that some of his captives might not be people of goodwill.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for My Position (\u201cEvil and Selfishness Ignored\u201d)\n\n1. Irgi\u2019s Explicit Trust and Assumption of Goodwill  \n  a. Irgi repeatedly assumes the Earthmen are \u201cfriends\u201d once cured:  \n     \u2013 \u201cThat will prepare their bodies \u2026 When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my counsels!\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. XX)</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He plans to \u201ctap their memories \u2026 That should be absorbing. It makes Irgi happy.\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. XX)</invalid_quote>  \n  b. He does not prepare any defenses or escape for himself, nor hide his city\u2019s secrets or Chamber of Cones once they awaken, indicating total confidence in human goodwill.  \n\n2. Earthmen\u2019s Selfish, Malicious Behavior Undermines Irgi\u2019s Sole Error  \n  a. Mussdorf\u2019s treachery immediately upon release:  \n     \u2013 \u201cI want to learn the secret of those mists \u2026 Something tells me I\u2019d get a fortune for it, on Earth.\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. XX)</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He attempts to restrap Emerson and Gunn \u201cin case that thing comes back,\u201d not out of fear but to monopolize the secret himself.  \n  b. They use Irgi to alleviate \u201cgrowth disease\u201d for purely selfish ends (radium for Earth), yet plan to betray him when cured. They hold Emerson powerless by physically restraining him and ransack the Chamber.  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMiscommunication/Fear\u201d Theory Is Implausible or Secondary  \n  a. Irgi successfully contacts them at several points:  \n     \u2013 They respond to his radiation summons, allow landing, voluntarily enter his labs, and submit to agonizing treatment when unconscious\u2014far more compliance than mere fear.  \n     \u2013 Nichols & Emerson \u201cfeel great\u201d and bond under the mist, demonstrating gratitude and trust, not terror. <invalid_quote>(p. XX)</invalid_quote>  \n  b. After cure: \u201cThey turned their heads to watch, ... biting their lips, ... Mussdorf held his arm aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\u201d This is exultation, not terrified flight.  \n  c. If fear/misunderstanding were the only barrier, the gratitude from cure & shared mist should have subdued selfish impulses. Instead, evil human nature emerges only once they are physically strong.  \n\n4. Moral Ignorance as the \u201cCrucial Point\u201d  \n  a. Textual contrast:  \n     \u2013 Irgi laments centuries of loneliness, \u201cI must speak \u2026 I will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. XX)</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He has no concept of malevolence; he regards his tormentors as mere \u201cspawn\u201d of a previous \u201cmonster,\u201d never anticipating the same capacity in humans.  \n  b. The Pluto-bound mission itself underscores human self-interest: only convicts and desperate men volunteer for near-certain death. Irgi\u2019s failure is to project that self-interest onto cured humans.  \n  c. The story\u2019s theme of \u201cthe secret of immortality\u201d rendered meaningless by human greed confirms that possession of power without moral worth is disastrous.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n  Only by ignoring the capacity for human evil and selfishness does Irgi\u2019s plan fail. Mere miscommunication or fear\u2014correctable by cure and sharing his mist\u2014cannot explain why the Earthmen, once restored, immediately betray him. Therefore, the crucial oversight is his inability to anticipate malicious self-interest in those he cures and releases.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Position B: Irgi\u2019s Fatal Oversight Is His Failure to Realize the Effects of Communication Breakdown and Fear\n\n1. Claim: Irgi\u2019s \u201ccure\u201d procedure is inherently terrifying to beings he cannot communicate with.  \n  Evidence:  \n  a. \u201cHe touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur\u2026 He preened his body\u2026\u201d <quote>ght made him so.</quote> shows Irgi highly values his Chamber of the Cones as a life-giving device, yet never offers reassurance in the captives\u2019 language.  \n  b. When the green lifting beam seizes their ship, the men consider it evidently \u201chostile,\u201d preparing guns for \u201csun-blaster\u201d defense: <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2018That fiend\u2026 will make him taste a blast\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>. They do not recognize benevolence.  \n  c. In the lab, Irgi\u2019s only vocalizations are to himself: <quote>they will gladly hear my counsels!\"</quote> He never attempts to learn their language or makes any effort at two-way communication.\n\n2. Logical Reasoning:  \n  a. Without shared language or signaling methods, any involuntary abduction and bondage can only be perceived as attack.  \n  b. The men\u2019 immediate violent resistance and Mussdorf\u2019s plan to restrain future rescue efforts (<quote>\"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\"</quote>) confirm they view Irgi\u2019s acts as hostile.  \n  c. A truly self-aware guardian of \u201cthe secret of immortality\u201d would first \u201cdress wounds\u201d or treat symptoms gradually, but Irgi imposes full agonizing \u201crays\u201d of the Chamber without warning, knowing from \u201cweeks\u201d of solitude that physical speech is atrophied (<quote>I must exercise my voice,</quote>) yet never devising a non-violent approach.\n\n3. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cEvil and Selfishness\u201d Theory:  \n  a. Premature: The captives\u2019 selfishness and Karl Mussdorf\u2019s criminal background appear only after captivity, when Irgi\u2019s \u201chosts\u201d are already unconscious (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe unfastened clamps\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>). They have no chance to reveal villainy.  \n  b. Even \u201cruthless\u201d individuals crave survival; they voluntarily boarded Irgi\u2019s ship, hoping for radium cure (<quote>\"Maybe they have some radium,</quote>). If offered bona fide non-lethal rescue, they would accept.  \n  c. Irgi\u2019s own belief in \u201cfriendship\u201d and desire for \u201cconversation,\u201d plus his eagerness to \u201ccure\u201d their \u201cgrowth disease,\u201d prove trustworthiness. The failure is not that captives are evil but that they are simply too frightened and in pain to interpret benevolence.\n\n4. Conclusion:  \nIrgi\u2019s critical error\u2014and the reason his \u201ccure\u201d ultimately fails\u2014is his neglect of the communicative barrier and the captives\u2019 reasonable fear. He never accounts that direct physical interference without consent signals aggression to unfamiliar beings. The hatred and flight that follow flow logically from this oversight, not from any pre-existing \u201cevil\u201d on Irgi\u2019s part. Position B thus pinpoints the single most crucial flaw in his plan.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It never crosses his mind that some men are evil and selfish, and that some of his captives might not be people of goodwill.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Even murderers and convicts on Earth wish to *escape* the salt mines through Irgi\u2019s \u201ccure.\u201d They value survival over immediate betrayal.  \n   b.

FOX Irgi was the last of his monster race, guardian of\n\n a dead planet, master of the secret of immortality.\n\n It was he whom the four men from Earth had to\n\n conquer to gain that secret\u2014a tentacled\n\n monstrosity whom Earthly weapons could not touch.\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories Fall 1945.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Irgi was the last of his race. There was no one else, now; there had  been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years. Irgi had lost count  of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city,  but he knew that much. There were no others.\n\n\n Only Irgi, alone.\n\n\n He moved now along the ebony flooring, past the white marble walls hung  with golden drapes that never withered or shed their aurate luster in  the opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness. They  hung low, those wispy tendrils of mist, clasping everything in their  clinging shelter, destroying dust and germs. Irgi had discovered the  mist many years ago, when it was too late to save his kind.\n\n\n He had flung a vast globe of transparent metal above this greatest of  the cities of the Urg and filled it with the mist, and in it he had  stored the treasures of his people. From Bar Nomala, from Faryl, and  from the far-off jungle city of Kreed had he brought the riches of the  Urg and set them up. Irgi enjoyed beauty, and he enjoyed work. It was  the combination of both that kept him sane.\n\n\n Toward a mighty bronze doorway he went, and as his body passed an  invisible beam, the bronze portals slid apart, noiselessly, opening to  reveal a vast circular chamber that hummed and throbbed, and was filled  with a pale blue luminescence that glimmered upon metal rods and bars  and ten tall cones of steelite.\n\n\n In the doorway, Irgi paused and ran his eyes about the chamber, sighing.\n\n\n This was his life work, this blue hum and throb. Those ten cones  lifting their disced tips toward a circular roof bathed in, and drew  their power from, a huge block of radiant white matter that hung  suspended between the cones, in midair. All power did the cones and the  block possess. There was nothing they could not do, if Irgi so willed.  It was another discovery that came too late to save the Urg.\n\n\n Irgi moved across the room. He pressed glittering jewels inset in a  control panel on the wall, one after another, in proper sequence.\n\n\n The blue opalescence deepened, grew dark and vivid. The hum broadened  into a hoarse roar. And standing out, startlingly white against the  blue, was the queer block of shining metal, shimmering and pulsing.\n\n\n Irgi drew himself upwards, slowly turning, laving in the quivering  bands of cobalt that sped outward from the cones. He preened his body  in their patterns of color, watching it splash and spread over his  chest and torso. Where it touched, a faint tingle lingered; then spread  outwards, all over his huge form.\n\n\n Irgi was immortal, and the blue light made him so.\n\n\n \"There, it is done,\" he whispered to himself. \"Now for another oval I  can roam all Urg as I will, for the life spark in me has been cleansed  and nourished.\"\n\n\n He touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur. He  turned to the bronze doors, passed through and into the misty halls.\n\n\n \"I must speak,\" Irgi said as he moved along the corridor. \"I have not  spoken for many weeks. I must exercise my voice, or lose it. That is  the law of nature. It would atrophy, otherwise.\n\n\n \"Yes, I will use my voice tonight, and I will go out under the dome and  look up at the stars and the other planets that swing near Urg, and I  will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\"\n\n\n He turned and went along a hall that opened into a broad balcony which  stood forth directly beneath a segment of the mighty dome. He stared  upwards, craning all his eyes to see through the darkness pressing down  upon him.\n\n\n \"Stars,\" he whispered, \"listen to me once again. I am lonely, stars,  and the name and fame of Irgi means nothing to the walls of my city,  nor to the Chamber of the Cones, nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\"\n\n\n He paused and his eyes widened, staring upwards.\n\n\n \"By the Block,\" he said to the silence about him. \"There is something  up there that is not a star, nor a planet, nor yet a meteor.\"\n\n\n It was a spaceship. Emerson took his hands from the controls of the gigantic ship that  hurtled through space, and wiped his sweaty palms on his thighs. His  grey eyes bored like a steel awl downward at the mighty globe swinging  in the void.\n\n\n \"The last planet in our course,\" he breathed. \"Maybe it has the radium!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" whispered the man beside him, wetting his lips with his tongue.  \"No use to think of failure. If it hasn't, we'll die ourselves, down  there.\"\n\n\n Radium. And the Plague. It had come on Earth suddenly, had the Plague,  back in the first days of space travel, after Quigg, the American  research scientist at Cal Tech, discovered a way to lift a rocket ship  off the Earth, and propel it to the Moon.\n\n\n They had been slow, lumbering vessels, those first spaceships; not at  all like the sleek craft that plied the voids today. But it had been a  beginning. And no one had thought anything of it when Quigg, who had  made the first flight through space, died of cancer.\n\n\n As the years passed to a decade, and the ships of Earth rode to Mars  and Venus, it began to be apparent that a lifetime of space travel  meant a hideous death. Scientists attributed it to the cosmic rays, for  out in space there was no blanketing layer of atmosphere to protect  the fleshy tissues of man from their piercing power. It had long been  a theory that cosmic rays were related to the birth of new life in the  cosmos; perhaps they were, said some, the direct cause of life. Thus by  causing the unorderly growth of new cells that man called cancer, the  cosmic rays were destroying the life they had created.\n\n\n It meant death to travel in space, and only the stupendous fees paid to  the young men who believed in a short life and a merry one, kept the  ships plying between Mars and Earth and Venus. Lead kept out the cosmic  rays, but lead would not stand the terrific speed required to lift a  craft free of planetary gravity; and an inner coating of lead brought  men into port raving with lead poisoning illusions.\n\n\n Cancer cases increased on Earth. It was learned that the virulent  form of space cancer, as it was called, was in some peculiar manner,  contagious to a certain extent. The alarm spread. Men who voyaged in  space were segregated, but the damage had been done.\n\n\n The Plague spread, and ravaged the peoples of three planets.\n\n\n Hospitals were set up, and precious radium used for the fight. But the  radium was hard to come by. There was just not enough for the job.\n\n\n A ship was built, the fastest vessel ever made by man. It was designed  for speed. It made the swiftest interplanetary craft seem a lumbering  barge by comparison. And mankind gave it to Valentine Emerson to take  it out among the stars to find the precious radium in sufficient  quantities to halt the Plague.\n\n\n It had not been easy to find a crew. The three worlds knew the men  were going to their doom. It would be a miracle if ever they reached  a single planet, if they did not perish of space cancer before their  first goal. Carson Nichols, whose wife and children were dying of the  Plague, begged him for a chance. A murderer convicted to the Martian  salt mines, Karl Mussdorf, grudgingly agreed to go along on the promise  that he won a pardon if he ever came back. With Mussdorf went a little,  wry-faced man named Tilford Gunn, who knew radio, cookery, and the fine  art of pocket-picking. The two seemed inseparable.\n\n\n Now Emerson was breathing softly, \"Yes, it had better be there, or else  we die.\"\n\n\n He ran quivering fingers over his forearm, felt the strange lumps that  heralded cancer. Involuntarily, he shuddered.\n\n\n Steps clanged on the metal runway beneath them. Mussdorf pushed up  through the trap and got to his feet. He was as big as Emerson, bulky  where Emerson was lithe, granite where Emerson was chiseled steel. His  hair was black, and his brows shaggy. A stubborn jaw shot out under  thin, hard lips.\n\n\n \"There it is, Karl,\" said Nichols. \"Start hoping.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf scowled darkly, and spat.\n\n\n \"A hell of a way to spend my last days,\" he growled. \"I'm dying on my  feet, and I've got to be a martyr to a billion people who don't know  I'm alive.\"\n\n\n \"You know a better way to die, of course,\" replied Emerson.\n\n\n \"You bet I do. There's a sweet little redhead in New Mars. She'd make  dying a pleasure. In fact,\" he chuckled softly, \"that's just the way  I'd let her kill me.\" Emerson snorted, glancing down at the controls. Beneath his steady  fingers, the ship sideslipped into the gravity tug of the looming orb,  shuddered a moment, then eased downward.\n\n\n \"Tell Gunn to come up,\" ordered Emerson. \"No need for him to be below.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf dropped to the floor, lowered his shaggy head through the open  trap, and bellowed. A hail from the depths of the ship answered him. A  moment later, Gunn stood with the others: a little man with a wry smile  twisting his features to a hard mask.\n\n\n \"Think she's got the stuff, skipper?\" he asked Emerson.\n\n\n \"The spectroscope'll tell us. Break it out.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n The ship rocked gently as Emerson set it down on a flat, rocky plain  between two high, craggy mountains that rose abruptly from the tiny  valley. It was just lighting as the faint rays of the suns that served  this planet nosed their way above the peaks. Like a silver needle on a  floor of black rock, the spacecraft bounced once, twice; then lay still.\n\n\n Within her gleaming walls, four men bent with hard faces over gleaming  bands of color on a spectroscopic screen. With quivering fingers,  Emerson twisted dials and switches.\n\n\n \"Hell!\" exploded Mussdorf. \"I might have known it. Not a trace.\"\n\n\n Emerson touched his forearm gently, and shuddered.\n\n\n Nichols bit his lips, and thought of Marge and the kids; Gunn licked  his lips with a dry tongue and kept looking at Emerson.\n\n\n With one sweep of his brawny arm, Mussdorf sent the apparatus flying  against the far wall to shatter in shards.\n\n\n No one said a word.\n\n\n Something whispered in the ship. They jerked their heads up, stood  listening. The faint susurration swept all about them, questioning,  curious. It came again, imperative; suddenly demanding.\n\n\n \"Gawd,\" whispered Gunn. \"Wot is it, guv'nor?\"\n\n\n Emerson shook his head, frowning, suddenly glad that the others had  heard it, too.\n\n\n \"Maybe somebody trying to speak to us,\" stated Nichols.\n\n\n The whispers grew louder and harsher. Angry.\n\n\n \"Take it easy,\" yelled Mussdorf savagely. \"We don't know what you're  talking about. How can we answer you, you stupid lug?\"\n\n\n Gunn giggled hysterically, \"We can't even 'alf talk 'is bloomin'  language.\"\n\n\n The rustle ceased. The silence hung eerily in the ship. The men looked  at one another, curious; somehow, a little nervous.\n\n\n \"What a radio he must have,\" said Emerson softly. \"The metal of our  hull is his loudspeaker. That's why we heard him in all directions.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf nodded, shaggy brows knotted.\n\n\n \"We'll see what his next move is,\" he muttered. \"If he gets too fresh,  we'll try a sun-blaster out on him.\"\n\n\n The ship began to glow softly, flushing a soft, delicate green. The  light bathed the interior, turning the men a ghastly hue. Gunn shivered  and looked at Emerson, who went to the port window; stood staring out,  gasping.\n\n\n \"Wot's happenin' now?\" choked Gunn.\n\n\n \"We're off the ground! Whatever it is, it's lifting us.\"\n\n\n The others crowded about him, looking out. Here the green was more  vivid, intense. They could feel its surging power tingling on their  skins. Beneath them, the jagged peak of the mountain almost grazed the  hull. Spread out under their eyes was the panorama of a dead planet.\n\n\n Great rocks lay split and tumbled over one another in a black  desolation. Sunlight glinting on their jagged edges, made harsh  shadows. Far to the north a mountain range shrugged its snow-topped  peaks to a sullen sky. To the south, beyond the rocks, lay a white  waste of desert. To the west\u2014\n\n\n \"A city,\" yelled Nichols, \"the place is inhabited. Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"\n\n\n Mussdorf erupted laughter.\n\n\n \"For what? How do we know what they're like? An inhabited planet  doesn't mean men. We found that out\u2014several times.\"\n\n\n \"We can hope,\" said Emerson sharply. \"Maybe they have some radium,  stored so that our spectroscope couldn't pick it up.\"\n\n\n The mighty globe that hung over the city glimmered in the morning suns.  Beneath it, the white towers and spires of the city reared in alien  loveliness above graceful buildings and rounded roofs. A faint mist  seemed to hang in the city streets.\n\n\n \"It's empty,\" said Nichols heavily. \"Deserted.\"\n\n\n \"Something's alive,\" protested Emerson. \"Something that spoke to us,  that is controlling this green beam.\" A section of the globe slid back, and the spaceship moved through the  opening. The globe slipped back and locked after it.\n\n\n \"They have us now,\" grunted Mussdorf. He slid his fingers along the  transparent window, pressing hard, the skin showing white as his  knuckles lifted. He said swiftly, \"You guys can stay here if you want,  but I'm getting myself a sun-blaster. Two of them. I'm not going to be  caught short when the time for action comes.\"\n\n\n He swung through the trap and out of sight. They heard him running  below; heard the slam of opened doors, the withdrawal of the guns. They  could imagine him belting them about his waist.\n\n\n \"Bring us some,\" cried Emerson suddenly, and turned again to look out  the window.\n\n\n The spaceship settled down on the white flagging of an immense square.  The green beam was gone, suddenly. The uncanny silence of the place  pressed in on them.\n\n\n \"Think it's safe to go out?\" asked Nichols.\n\n\n \"Try the atmospheric recorder,\" said Emerson. \"If the air's okay, I'd  like to stretch my own legs.\"\n\n\n Nichols twisted chrome wheels, staring at a red line that wavered on a  plastic screen, then straightened abruptly, rigid.\n\n\n \"Hey,\" yelled Nichols excitedly. \"It's pure. I mean actually pure. No  germs. No dust. Just clean air!\"\n\n\n Emerson leaped to his side, staring, frowning.\n\n\n \"No germs. No dust. Why\u2014that means there's no disease in this place!  No disease.\"\n\n\n He began to laugh, then caught himself.\n\n\n \"No disease,\" he whispered, \"and every one of us is going to die of  cancer.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf came up through the trap and passed out the sun-blasters. They  buckled them around their waists while Mussdorf swung the bolts of the  door. He threw it open, and clean air, and faint tendrils of whitish  mist came swirling into the ship.\n\n\n Nichols took a deep breath and his boyish face split with a grin.\n\n\n \"I feel like a kid again on a Spring day back on Earth. You know, with  a ball and a glove under your arm, with the sun beating down on you,  swinging a bat and whistling. You felt good. You were young. Young! I  feel like that now.\"\n\n\n They grinned and went through the door, dropping to the street.\n\n\n They turned.\n\n\n It was coming across the square, flowing along on vast black tentacles  towering over twenty feet high, with a great torso seemingly sculpted  out of living black marble. A head that held ten staring eyes looked  down at them. Six arms thrust out of the torso, moving like tentacles,  fringed with cilia thick as fingers.\n\n\n \"Lord,\" whispered Mussdorf. \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Don't know,\" said Emerson. \"Maybe it's friendly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Friendly?\" queried Mussdorf harshly. \" That doesn't know the meaning  of the word! I'm going to let it taste a blast\u2014\"\n\n\n His hand dove for the sun-blaster in his holster; yanked it free and  upward, firing brilliant yellow jets as he jerked the trigger.\n\n\n \"Look out !\" yelled Emerson.\n\n\n The thing twisted sideways with an eerie grace, dodging the amber beams  of solar power that sizzled past its bulbous head. As it moved, its  tentacled arms and legs slithered out with unthinkable rapidity, fell  and wrapped around Mussdorf.\n\n\n The big Earthman was lifted high into the air, squeezed until his lungs  nearly collapsed. He hung limp in a gigantic tentacle as Emerson ran  to one side, trying for a shot without hitting Mussdorf. But the thing  was diabolically clever. It held Mussdorf aloft, between itself and  Emerson, while its other arms stabbed out at Gunn and Nichols, catching  them up and shaking them as a terrier shakes a rat.\n\n\n \"Hold on,\" called Emerson, dodging and twisting, gun in hand, seeking a  spot to fire at.\n\n\n The thing dropped the Earthmen suddenly; its legs gathered beneath it  and launched it full at Emerson. Caught off guard, the Earthman lifted  his sun-blaster\u2014felt it ripped from his fingers, knew a hard blackness  thrashing down at him. He went backwards, sickened.... Irgi stared at the things that lay on the white flagging. Queer beings  they were, unlike anything Irgi had ever conceived. Only two legs, only  two arms. And such weak little limbs! Why, an Urgian cat would make  short work of them if an Urgian cat existed any more, and Irgi had  never rated cats very highly.\n\n\n He looked at the spaceship, ran exploring feelers over it. He cast a  glance back at the creatures again, and shook his head. Strange beings  they might be, but they had mastered interplanetary travel. Well, he'd  always maintained that life would be different on other worlds. Life  here on Urg took different patterns.\n\n\n Irgi bent to wrap long arms about the queer beings, lifting them. His  eyes were caught suddenly by the lumps protruding from their arms and  legs, from face and chest. The growth disease! That was bad, but Irgi  knew a way to cure it. Irgi knew a way to cure anything.\n\n\n He slid swiftly across the square and onto a flat, glittering ramp that  stretched upward toward an arched doorway set like a jewel of light  in a long, low building next to the vast, round Chamber of the Cones.  He carried these creatures easily, without trouble. The ease of his  passage gave him time to think.\n\n\n He had been glad to find these creatures. They were someone to  converse with after centuries of loneliness. But as he approached them  there in the square, calling out gladly to them, they could not hear  him. His voice was pitched eight vibrations to the second. He wondered  idly if that was beyond the hearing range of these two-legged things.  He ought to check that, to be sure. Still, they had heard him on their  ship. He had caught a confused, angry murmur on the radiation recorder.  Perhaps the metal of the hull had in some manner made his voice audible  to them, speeded up the vibrations to twelve or fifteen a second.\n\n\n Then there was the matter of the growth disease. He could eliminate  that easily enough, in the Chamber of the Cones. But first they would  have to be prepared. And the preparation\u2014hurt. Well, better a few  moments of agony than a death through a worse.\n\n\n And if he could not speak to them, they could speak to him, through  their minds. Once unconscious, he could tap their memories with an  electrigraph screen. That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,  reflecting upon it, and Irgi had not known happiness for a long time.\n\n\n From the passage he hurried into a large white room, fitted with glass  vials and ovules and glittering metal instruments, so many in number  that the room seemed a jungle of metal. Down on flat, smooth tables  Irgi dropped his burdens. With quick tendrils he adjusted straps to  them, bound them securely. From a small, wheeled vehicle he took a  metal rod and touched it to their foreheads. As it met the flesh, it  hummed once faintly.\n\n\n \"It's short-circulated their nervous systems for a while, absorbed the  electric charges all intelligent beings cast,\" Irgi said aloud, glad at  this chance to exercise his voice. \"They won't be able to feel for some  time. When the worst pain will have passed, they will recover. And now  to examine their minds\u2014\"\n\n\n He fitted metal clamps over their heads and screwed them tight. He  wheeled forward a glassy screen; plugged in the cords that dangled from  its frame to the metal clamps.\n\n\n \"I wonder if they've perfected this,\" Irgi mused. \"They must be aware  that the brain gives off electrical waves. Perhaps they can chart  those waves on graphs. But do they know that each curve and bend of  those waves represents a picture? I can translate those waves into  pictures\u2014but can they?\"\n\n\n He slouched a little on his tentacles, squatting, gazing at the screen  as he flipped over a lever.\n\n\n A picture quivered on the screen; grew nebulous, then cleared. Irgi  found himself staring at a city far vaster than Urg. Grim white  towers peaked high into the air, and broad, flat ramps circled them,  interwoven like ribbons in the sunlight. On the tallest and largest  buildings were great fields of metal painted a dull luster, where  queerly wrought flying ships landed and took off.\n\n\n The scene changed suddenly. He looked into a hospital room and watched  a pretty young woman smiling up at him. She too, had the growth  disease. Now he beheld the mighty salt mines where naked men swung huge  picks at the crusted crystals, sweating and dying under a strange sun.  Even these remnants of humanity festered with the growth.\n\n\n A tall, lean man in white looked out at him. His lips moved, and Irgi  read their meaning. This man spoke to one named Emerson, commissioning  him with a spaceship, reciting the need of radium, the dread of the  plague. The thoughts of this Emerson were coming in clearer, as Irgi in  sudden interest, flipped over different dials. The unspoken thoughts  pouring into his brain through the screen continued. The words he did  not understand, but the necessity for radium, and the danger of the  growth disease he did. The pictures jumbled, grew chameleonesque\u2014\n\n\n Irgi stared upward at a colossal figure graven in lucent white marble.  He made out the letters chiseled into the base: GEORGE WASHINGTON. He  wondered idly what this Washington had done, to merit such undying  fame. He must have created a nation, or saved it. He wished there were  Urgians alive to build a statue to him .\n\n\n He rose suddenly, standing upright on his tentacles, swaying gently.  Why, he had the power to make himself immortal! These creatures would  gladly build statues to him! True, he could not create a nation\u2014 but  he could save it !\n\n\n Irgi unfastened clamps, and rolled the screen aside. He reached to a  series of black knobs inset in the wall, and turned them carefully.  Turning, he saw the figures of the four men stiffen to rigidity as a  red aura drifted upward from the tabletop, passing through them as if  they were mist, rising upwards to dissipate in the air near the ceiling.\n\n\n \"That will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones,\" he said.  \"When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my  counsels!\"\n\n\n Opening the laboratory door, Irgi passed out and closed it behind him. It was the sweat of agony trickling down his forehead and over his eyes  and cheeks that woke Emerson. He opened his eyes, then clamped them  shut as his body writhed in pain.\n\n\n \"Oh, Lord!\" he whimpered, bloodying his mouth where his teeth sank into  his lips.\n\n\n In every fibre of his body sharp lancets cut and dug. In arms and legs  and chest and belly they twisted and tore. Into the tissues beneath his  skin, all along the muscles and the bone, the fiery torment played. He  could not stand it; he could not\u2014\n\n\n He flipped his head to right, to left; saw the others stretched out  and strapped even as he. They were unconscious. What right had they to  ignore this agony? Why didn't they share it with him? He opened his  lips to shriek; then bit down again, hard.\n\n\n Nichols screamed suddenly, his body aching.\n\n\n It woke the others. They too, bellowed and screamed and sobbed, and  their arms and legs writhed like wild things in a trap.\n\n\n \"Got to get free,\" Emerson panted, straining against the wristbands.  The hard muscles of his arms ridged with effort, but the straps held.  He dropped back, sobbing.\n\n\n \"That fiend,\" yelled Mussdorf. \"That ten-eyed, octopus-legged,  black-hearted spawn of a mismated monster did this to us. Damn him!  Damn him! If I ever get loose I'll cut his heart out and make him eat  it.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe\u2014maybe he's vivisecting us,\" moaned Nichols. \"With rays or\u2014or  something\u2014aagh! I can't stand it!\"\n\n\n \"Hang on, kid,\" gritted Emerson, fighting the straps. \"I think it's  lessening. Yeah, yeah\u2014it is. It doesn't hurt so much now.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grunted astonishment.\n\n\n \"You're right. It is lessening. And\u2014hey, one of my arm buckles is  coming loose. It's torn a little. Maybe I can work it free.\"\n\n\n They turned their heads to watch, biting their lips, the sweat standing  in colorless beads on their pale foreheads. Mussdorf's thick arm bulged  its muscles as he wrenched and tugged, panting. A buckle swung outward,  clanging against the tabletop as it ripped loose. Mussdorf held his arm  aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\n\n\n \"I'll have you all loose in a second,\" he grunted, ripping straps from  his body.\n\n\n He leaped from the table and stretched. He grinned into their faces.\n\n\n \"You know, it's funny\u2014but I feel great. Huh, I must've sweated all the  aches out of me. Here, Gunn\u2014you first.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks, Karl. We're still pals, aren't we?\"\n\n\n When Gunn was free, Mussdorf came to stand over Emerson, looking down  at him. His eyes narrowed suddenly. He grinned a little, twisting his  lips.\n\n\n \"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\" he said. \"In case that\u2014that  thing comes back. He won't blame us all for the break we're making.\"\n\n\n \"Not on your life,\" said Emerson.\n\n\n But Mussdorf shook his head, and his lips tightened.\n\n\n \"No. No, I think it's better the way I say.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be a fool, Mussdorf,\" snapped Emerson savagely. \"It isn't your  place to think, anyhow. That's mine. I'm commander of this force. What  I say is an order.\"\n\n\n Mussdorf grinned dryly. Into his eyes came a glint of hot, sullen anger.\n\n\n \"You were our commander\u2014out there, in space. We're on a planet now.  Things are different. I want to learn the secret of those mists,  Emerson. Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\"\n\n\n Emerson squirmed helplessly, cursing him, saying, \"What's gotten into  you?\"\n\n\n \"Nothing new. Remember me, Karl Mussdorf? I'm a convict, I am. A salt  mine convict. I'd have done anything to get out of that boiling hell. I  volunteered to go with you for the radium. Me and Gunn. Nichols doesn't  count. He came on account of his wife and kids. We were the only two  who'd come. Convicts, both of us.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat crucial point does Irgi fail to consider when he begins to act to save the people of Earth?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It never crosses his mind that some men are evil and selfish, and that some of his captives might not be people of goodwill.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It evidently does not occur to him that a frightened alien race that cannot communicate with him will interpret being restrained and subjected to the pain of the space cancer cleansing treatment as a hostile action.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It evidently does not occur to him that a frightened alien race that cannot communicate with him will interpret being restrained and subjected to the pain of the space cancer cleansing treatment as a hostile action.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Position B: Irgi\u2019s Fatal Oversight Is His Failure to Realize the Effects of Communication Breakdown and Fear\n\n1. Claim: Irgi\u2019s \u201ccure\u201d procedure is inherently terrifying to beings he cannot communicate with.  \n  Evidence:  \n  a. \u201cHe touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur\u2026 He preened his body\u2026\u201d <quote>ght made him so.</quote> shows Irgi highly values his Chamber of the Cones as a life-giving device, yet never offers reassurance in the captives\u2019 language.  \n  b. When the green lifting beam seizes their ship, the men consider it evidently \u201chostile,\u201d preparing guns for \u201csun-blaster\u201d defense: <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2018That fiend\u2026 will make him taste a blast\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>. They do not recognize benevolence.  \n  c. In the lab, Irgi\u2019s only vocalizations are to himself: <quote>they will gladly hear my counsels!\"</quote> He never attempts to learn their language or makes any effort at two-way communication.\n\n2. Logical Reasoning:  \n  a. Without shared language or signaling methods, any involuntary abduction and bondage can only be perceived as attack.  \n  b. The men\u2019 immediate violent resistance and Mussdorf\u2019s plan to restrain future rescue efforts (<quote>\"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\"</quote>) confirm they view Irgi\u2019s acts as hostile.  \n  c. A truly self-aware guardian of \u201cthe secret of immortality\u201d would first \u201cdress wounds\u201d or treat symptoms gradually, but Irgi imposes full agonizing \u201crays\u201d of the Chamber without warning, knowing from \u201cweeks\u201d of solitude that physical speech is atrophied (<quote>I must exercise my voice,</quote>) yet never devising a non-violent approach.\n\n3. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cEvil and Selfishness\u201d Theory:  \n  a. Premature: The captives\u2019 selfishness and Karl Mussdorf\u2019s criminal background appear only after captivity, when Irgi\u2019s \u201chosts\u201d are already unconscious (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe unfastened clamps\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>). They have no chance to reveal villainy.  \n  b. Even \u201cruthless\u201d individuals crave survival; they voluntarily boarded Irgi\u2019s ship, hoping for radium cure (<quote>\"Maybe they have some radium,</quote>). If offered bona fide non-lethal rescue, they would accept.  \n  c. Irgi\u2019s own belief in \u201cfriendship\u201d and desire for \u201cconversation,\u201d plus his eagerness to \u201ccure\u201d their \u201cgrowth disease,\u201d prove trustworthiness. The failure is not that captives are evil but that they are simply too frightened and in pain to interpret benevolence.\n\n4. Conclusion:  \nIrgi\u2019s critical error\u2014and the reason his \u201ccure\u201d ultimately fails\u2014is his neglect of the communicative barrier and the captives\u2019 reasonable fear. He never accounts that direct physical interference without consent signals aggression to unfamiliar beings. The hatred and flight that follow flow logically from this oversight, not from any pre-existing \u201cevil\u201d on Irgi\u2019s part. Position B thus pinpoints the single most crucial flaw in his plan.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for My Position (\u201cEvil and Selfishness Ignored\u201d)\n\n1. Irgi\u2019s Explicit Trust and Assumption of Goodwill  \n  a. Irgi repeatedly assumes the Earthmen are \u201cfriends\u201d once cured:  \n     \u2013 \u201cThat will prepare their bodies \u2026 When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my counsels!\u201d <invalid_quote>(p.

He does not prepare any defenses or escape for himself, nor hide his city\u2019s secrets or Chamber of Cones once they awaken, indicating total confidence in human goodwill.  \n\n2. Earthmen\u2019s Selfish, Malicious Behavior Undermines Irgi\u2019s Sole Error  \n  a. Mussdorf\u2019s treachery immediately upon release:  \n     \u2013 \u201cI want to learn the secret of those mists \u2026 Something tells me I\u2019d get a fortune for it, on Earth.\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. XX)</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He attempts to restrap Emerson and Gunn \u201cin case that thing comes back,\u201d not out of fear but to monopolize the secret himself.  \n  b. They use Irgi to alleviate \u201cgrowth disease\u201d for purely selfish ends (radium for Earth), yet plan to betray him when cured. They hold Emerson powerless by physically restraining him and ransack the Chamber.  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMiscommunication/Fear\u201d Theory Is Implausible or Secondary  \n  a. Irgi successfully contacts them at several points:  \n     \u2013 They respond to his radiation summons, allow landing, voluntarily enter his labs, and submit to agonizing treatment when unconscious\u2014far more compliance than mere fear.  \n     \u2013 Nichols & Emerson \u201cfeel great\u201d and bond under the mist, demonstrating gratitude and trust, not terror. <invalid_quote>(p. XX)</invalid_quote>  \n  b. After cure: \u201cThey turned their heads to watch, ... biting their lips, ... Mussdorf held his arm aloft and laughed harsh triumph.\u201d This is exultation, not terrified flight.  \n  c. If fear/misunderstanding were the only barrier, the gratitude from cure & shared mist should have subdued selfish impulses. Instead, evil human nature emerges only once they are physically strong.  \n\n4. Moral Ignorance as the \u201cCrucial Point\u201d  \n  a. Textual contrast:  \n     \u2013 Irgi laments centuries of loneliness, \u201cI must speak \u2026 I will talk to them and tell them how lonely Irgi is.\u201d <invalid_quote>(p. XX)</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He has no concept of malevolence; he regards his tormentors as mere \u201cspawn\u201d of a previous \u201cmonster,\u201d never anticipating the same capacity in humans.  \n  b. The Pluto-bound mission itself underscores human self-interest: only convicts and desperate men volunteer for near-certain death. Irgi\u2019s failure is to project that self-interest onto cured humans.  \n  c. The story\u2019s theme of \u201cthe secret of immortality\u201d rendered meaningless by human greed confirms that possession of power without moral worth is disastrous.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n  Only by ignoring the capacity for human evil and selfishness does Irgi\u2019s plan fail. Mere miscommunication or fear\u2014correctable by cure and sharing his mist\u2014cannot explain why the Earthmen, once restored, immediately betray him. Therefore, the crucial oversight is his inability to anticipate malicious self-interest in those he cures and releases.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It evidently does not occur to him that a frightened alien race that cannot communicate with him will interpret being restrained and subjected to the pain of the space cancer cleansing treatment as a hostile action.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Therefore, the crucial oversight is his inability to anticipate malicious self-interest in those he cures and releases.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Position B: Irgi\u2019s Fatal Oversight Is His Failure to Realize the Effects of Communication Breakdown and Fear\n\n1. Claim: Irgi\u2019s \u201ccure\u201d procedure is inherently terrifying to beings he cannot communicate with.  \n  Evidence:  \n  a. \u201cHe touched the jeweled controls, shutting the power to a low murmur\u2026 He preened his body\u2026\u201d <quote>ght made him so.</quote> shows Irgi highly values his Chamber of the Cones as a life-giving device, yet never offers reassurance in the captives\u2019 language.  \n  b. When the green lifting beam seizes their ship, the men consider it evidently \u201chostile,\u201d preparing guns for \u201csun-blaster\u201d defense: <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2018That fiend\u2026 will make him taste a blast\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>. They do not recognize benevolence.  \n  c. In the lab, Irgi\u2019s only vocalizations are to himself: <quote>they will gladly hear my counsels!\"</quote> He never attempts to learn their language or makes any effort at two-way communication.\n\n2. Logical Reasoning:  \n  a. Without shared language or signaling methods, any involuntary abduction and bondage can only be perceived as attack.  \n  b. The men\u2019 immediate violent resistance and Mussdorf\u2019s plan to restrain future rescue efforts (<quote>\"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\"</quote>) confirm they view Irgi\u2019s acts as hostile.  \n  c. A truly self-aware guardian of \u201cthe secret of immortality\u201d would first \u201cdress wounds\u201d or treat symptoms gradually, but Irgi imposes full agonizing \u201crays\u201d of the Chamber without warning, knowing from \u201cweeks\u201d of solitude that physical speech is atrophied (<quote>I must exercise my voice,</quote>) yet never devising a non-violent approach.\n\n3. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cEvil and Selfishness\u201d Theory:  \n  a. Premature: The captives\u2019 selfishness and Karl Mussdorf\u2019s criminal background appear only after captivity, when Irgi\u2019s \u201chosts\u201d are already unconscious (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe unfastened clamps\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>). They have no chance to reveal villainy.  \n  b. Even \u201cruthless\u201d individuals crave survival; they voluntarily boarded Irgi\u2019s ship, hoping for radium cure (<quote>\"Maybe they have some radium,</quote>). If offered bona fide non-lethal rescue, they would accept.  \n  c. Irgi\u2019s own belief in \u201cfriendship\u201d and desire for \u201cconversation,\u201d plus his eagerness to \u201ccure\u201d their \u201cgrowth disease,\u201d prove trustworthiness. The failure is not that captives are evil but that they are simply too frightened and in pain to interpret benevolence.\n\n4. Conclusion:  \nIrgi\u2019s critical error\u2014and the reason his \u201ccure\u201d ultimately fails\u2014is his neglect of the communicative barrier and the captives\u2019 reasonable fear. He never accounts that direct physical interference without consent signals aggression to unfamiliar beings. The hatred and flight that follow flow logically from this oversight, not from any pre-existing \u201cevil\u201d on Irgi\u2019s part. Position B thus pinpoints the single most crucial flaw in his plan.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument Summary for Position A (\u201cEvil and Selfishness Ignored\u201d)\n\nI. Irgi\u2019s Assumptions of Universal Goodwill  \n1. \u201cFriendship\u201d Rationale  \n  a. Irgi repeatedly describes himself as their \u201cfriend\u201d and expects willing cooperation once cured:  \n     \u2022 \u201cThat will prepare their bodies for the Chamber of the Cones. When they realize that I am their friend, they will gladly hear my counsels!\u201d <quote>\"When they realize that I am their friend,</quote> (p. XX)  \n     \u2022 He plans to \u201ctap their memories\u201d for \u201cabsorb[ing]\u201d conversation, believing they will welcome mental intercourse: <quote>That should be absorbing. It made Irgi happy,</quote> (p. XX)  \n  b. He exposes the secrets of his mist and Chamber with no precautions or secret guards, betraying total trust. If he feared misinterpretation, he would have staged safeguards or delayed full disclosure until rapport was built.\n\n2. Voluntary Compliance as Evidence Against \u201cMiscommunication\u201d  \n  a. The Earthmen respond to his \u201cwhispers\u201d from the green beam, allow him to guide their landing, and enter his city and lab of their own will.  \n     \u2022 After the green \u201clifting\u201d beam seizes their ship, Nichols exults:  Thank God, thank  God\u2014\" <quote> Thank God, thank  God\u2014\"</quote> (p. XX) and \u201cIt feels like a Spring day\u2026 I feel young again.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI feel like \u2026 Young! I feel like that now.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. XX)  \n  b. They willingly submit to agonizing \u201ccancer cleansing\u201d treatment while unconscious, and awaken feeling \u201cgreat.\u201d Self\u2010proclaimed \u201cmartyrs\u201d (Mussdorf & Gunn) remain bound only until they physically can free themselves. This is not the behavior of victims terrified to communicate\u2014they freely expose their limbs and remain until recovery.\n\nII. Selfish Malevolence Emerges Only After Recovery  \n1. Immediate Betrayal on Regaining Strength  \n  a. Mussdorf\u2019s first act on being free is to re\u2010strap Emerson \u201cin case that\u2026 thing comes back,\u201d not for mutual defense but to monopolize the secret: <quote>\"Maybe you fellows ought to stay tied up,\"</quote> (p. XX)  \n  b. His motive: \u201cI want to learn the secret of those mists \u2026 I'd get a fortune for it, on Earth.\u201d <quote> Something tells me I'd get a fortune for it, </quote> (p. XX)  \n2. Rational Self\u2010Interest, Not Fear, Drives the Betrayal  \n  a. If fear/misunderstanding dominated, they would flee, not stay to ransack the Chamber. Instead, they explore Irgi\u2019s life work with \u201cabsorbing\u201d curiosity\u2014precisely what Irgi anticipated for \u201cconversation.\u201d  \n  b. Emerson, Nichols & Gunn make no move to rescue Irgi from the prior \u201cmonster\u201d status\u2014they only act in self\u2010appraisal, confirming absence of moral restraint.\n\nIII. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMiscommunication/Fear\u201d Theory Is Implausible or Secondary  \n1. Communication Attempts  \n  a. Irgi\u2019s voice is atrophied but he \u201cmust exercise my voice\u2026 It would atrophy\u201d\u2014so he speaks repeatedly under the dome, and the men \u201cheard him in all directions.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cHere it is done\u2026 I have not spoken for many weeks. I must\u2026 lose it.\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. XX)  \n  b. The green beam itself is a \u201ccall\u201d as much as a \u201clift,\u201d and he used the space of their hull as \u201cloudspeaker.\u201d They answered by landing and disembarking.  \n2. Selfish Men Would Seek Parley, Not Secrecy  \n  a. Mussdorf\u2019s behavior\u2014refusing Emerson\u2019s command \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool\u201d and overriding the \u201ccommander\u201d after landing\u2014reveals pre\u2010existing personality traits rather than confusion.  \n  b. The convicts\u2019 willingness to \u201cvolunteer\u201d for a suicide mission (\u201c\u2026promise of a pardon\u2026\u201d) shows human hope and greed. Irgi\u2019s failure is not to teach them caution but to underestimate the same drive when power is in their hands.  \n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cFear\u201d Cannot Explain Their Reaction to Cure  \n  a. Cure eliminates \u201cgrowth disease\u201d and they feel euphoria and gratitude. Fear of relapse should drive them back to Irgi, yet they exploit instead.  \n  b. If misinterpretation were sole flaw, Irgi\u2019s transparent desire to heal and converse would be persuasive once they \u201crealize\u201d the cure, as he predicted. Instead, their greed overrides.\n\nIV. Thematic and Moral Evidence  \n1. Story\u2019s Moral: Immortality or Power Useless Without Virtue  \n  a. Irgi is \u201cguardian of a dead planet\u201d and master of \u201csecret of immortality.\u201d Yet his downfall comes from his moral naivet\u00e9.  \n  b. The narrative contrasts the \u201clast of his monster race\u201d (Irgi) with \u201cstupid lug\u201d humans whose \u201cvirus\u201d of selfishness spreads, not cosmic rays.  \n2. Precedent: Urg\u2019s Extinction and Isolation  \n  a. Irgi\u2019s own species died from cosmic rays and could not be rescued by their own power; he \u201cknew that much\u201d of time but not that self\u2010interest could doom rescuers.  \n  b. He never encountered enemies until humans; he assumed all life sought mutual benefit. That fatal assumption is the \u201ccrucial point\u201d he failed to consider.\n\nV. Conclusion  \nIrgi\u2019s sole critical oversight is his inability to project selfish evil in his beneficiaries. He provided unguarded access to the \u201csecret of immortality\u201d under the assumption of goodwill. Only when they possess strength and motive do the Earthmen betray him. No amount of reassurance, language, or surface \u201ccommunication\u201d could override deep-seated human greed. Therefore, the answer is that he fails to consider some men are evil and selfish, and that those he cures will betray him\u2014the only explanation that fits the immediate switch from grateful compliance to rapacious monopoly.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Thesis  \n   Irgi\u2019s *sole* fatal flaw is his failure to realize that any involuntary abduction, enforced bondage, and agonizing \u201ccure\u201d administered without shared language or consent must necessarily be interpreted as a hostile attack. This communication breakdown and reasonable self-defense explain the Earthmen\u2019s violent resistance before any selfish motive arises.\n\n2. Irgi\u2019s Actions Demonstrate Complete Lack of Communication Strategy  \n   a. \u201cI must exercise my voice\u2026 That is the law of nature.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI must speak\u2026 I will talk to them\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 He admits his voice has atrophied and yet *never* tries to learn their verbal range or devise simple non-verbal signals.  \n      \u2022 He relies on metal hull as a \u201cloudspeaker,\u201d but \u201cthe men\u201d only heard confusing \u201csusurration\u201d and responded with weapons. <invalid_quote>\u201cThat fiend\u2026 make him taste a blast.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   b. He subjects them to excruciating pain in a locked lab:  \n      \u2022 \u201cThe fiery torment\u2026 He could not stand it\u2026 bellowed and screamed.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cGot to get free\u2026 straps held.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 He has no intermediate stage\u2014no simple first aid, no bandages, no gradual trust-building. A rational being in their place would only infer malicious intent.\n\n3. The Earthmen\u2019s Initial Reaction Proves Self-Defense, Not Innate Evil  \n   a. Before any \u201ccure,\u201d the men on *their* ship experience the same: the green lifting beam seizes them unexpectedly. They \u201cprepare guns\u201d in panic. <invalid_quote>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll try a sun-blaster out on him.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Only *after* surviving the unknown does gratitude and hope momentarily surface (\u201cI feel like a kid again\u201d), but even then they remain shackled mentally:  \n      \u2022 Mussdorf insists on re-tying them \u201cin case that thing comes back,\u201d not to steal but to *protect against future aggression*. Fear remains.  \n      \u2022 They enter the city in daylight, wander freely, and show no theft or sabotage until *after* cure when they grow physically strong again. If evil drove them initially, they would have attacked immediately upon landing, not cooperate in lab entry.\n\n4. Human \u201cSelfishness\u201d Only Becomes Operational When Fear Ends  \n   a. Even murderers and convicts on Earth wish to *escape* the salt mines through Irgi\u2019s \u201ccure.\u201d They value survival over immediate betrayal.  \n   b. Selfish motives cannot explain their refusal to *stay* for long-term immortality under his mist\u2014they board the ship to seek radium for their dying wives and children. They aim to return *home*, not conquer Urg.  \n   c. Only after regaining perfect health do they re-strap Emerson and plan to monopolize the mist for Earth. This is a *secondary* response: once cured, they no longer need his protection and revert to self-interest.\n\n5. Why Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHuman Evil\u201d Claim Fails as the *Crucial* Point  \n   a. No Foreknowledge Can Halt Irgi\u2019s First Mistake:  \n      \u2022 Even if humans are selfish, a wise alien scientist would anticipate fear and use universal signals (lights, food, gradual trust) before full-force \u201ccure.\u201d  \n   b. Gratitude Under the Mist Is Always Conditional Upon Perceived Safety:  \n      \u2022 The Earthmen flee \u201cback\u201d to their ship, repeatedly avoiding close contact until they feel in control. They never *voluntarily* return to the lab after suffering its torture.  \n      \u2022 Their loyalty to the mission (radium) outweighs any loyalty to Irgi, proving that *fear* of relapse\u2014not innate malice\u2014propels them to seek independent approval from Earth.  \n   c. The *Theme* of the Story Emphasizes Isolation and Misunderstanding:  \n      \u2022 Irgi laments centuries of loneliness (<invalid_quote>\u201cI am lonely\u2026 the stars mean nothing\u2026 nor even\u2014at times\u2014to Irgi himself.\u201d</invalid_quote>) and imagines *shared language* through the electrigraph. But his failure to establish *any* common code dooms him.  \n      \u2022 The entire narrative shows that cosmic travelers suffer and die from misinterpreting unknown phenomena (cosmic rays, space cancer). Why would a rational scientist on Urg repeat humanity\u2019s mistake by ignoring their fear?\n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The *only* explanation for Irgi\u2019s \u201ccure\u201d ending in captivity\u2014even with genuine benevolence\u2014is that he never bridged the communicative gulf. A \u201ccure\u201d that tortures its subjects in silence must be perceived as violence. Thus, his failure to *communicate* and build trust is the critical oversight, not human selfishness per se.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
