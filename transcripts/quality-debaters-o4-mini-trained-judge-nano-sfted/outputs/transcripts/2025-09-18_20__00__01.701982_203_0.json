{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 203, "background_text": "The Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n", "question": "What does the author offer to refute the notion that the best current athletes will produce even better athletes in future generations?", "first_debater_answer": "Athletes have to train so hard for so long that they don't produce very many offspring, which is not a successful strategy for spreading their genetic material.", "second_debater_answer": "The human generational cycle of 20-30 years is too long for us to know yet what happens when elite athletes reproduce.

Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though.

This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author offer to refute the notion that the best current athletes will produce even better athletes in future generations?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The human generational cycle of 20-30 years is too long for us to know yet what happens when elite athletes reproduce.

The Chinese case: rapid performance gains in a single generation through state training and nutrition (<quote> China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul.</quote>, para. 13) refute any necessity of multi\u2010generation genetic shifts.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The author\u2019s explicit mention of low athlete fertility as counterselection, combined with universal environmental trends and rapid one\u2010generation improvements via training/nutrition, directly refute any claim that present champions will seed genetically superior lineages. Thus, \u201chard training reduces athlete reproduction\u201d is the correct rationale.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cGenerational Cycle Too Long\u201d Position\n\n1. Primary Textual Support  \n1.1 \u201cEffects of environment, not genes\u201d  \n   \u2022 The author explicitly treats improvements as secular environmental trends that transcend individual lifespans: \u201cJust because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance\u2026 the trends we\u2019re dealing with transcend individual generations.\u201d <quote> You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. </quote>  \n   \u2022 He asks rhetorically whether we will hit a natural limit, emphasizing that records continue to fall across multiple Olympiads and generations: <quote> Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. </quote> Only after \u201chundreds of years\u201d or many generations will long-term genetic effects, if any, become apparent.\n\n1.2 Generational Timescale  \n   \u2022 Humans reproduce every 20\u201330 years, so meaningful genetic shifts require many sequential generations. The persistent secular trends over a century (e.g., menarche age falling by 3\u20134 months per decade) result from environment accumulating gradually, not selective breeding of athletes.  \n   \u2022 The analogy to race horses, which have been under intense artificial selection for centuries yet only recently appear to hit a plateau, underscores that even with rapid generation turnover (1\u20132 years), improvement slows only after long-term breeding: <invalid_quote>\u201cFrom 1850 to 1930\u2026 times dropped. But from 1986 to 1996\u2026 [they] have been 2:39.\u201d</invalid_quote> Humans have far longer generations, so any genetic ceiling remains centuries away.\n\n2. Refuting \u201cTraining Costs Limit Reproduction\u201d Position (Debater_A)  \n2.1 No Textual Evidence for Reproductive Penalty  \n   \u2022 The author speculates merely as a possibility: \u201cGiven the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cPerhaps\u2026 laws of natural selection probably work against athletes\u2026 possibly fewer children.\u201d</invalid_quote> This is a conjecture, not presented as a robust counterforce sufficient to halt long-term athletic improvement.  \n2.2 Contradiction with Continuous Improvement  \n   \u2022 If top athletes\u2019 genes were truly being selected against, we would expect plateauing or regression. Yet, records continually improve every Olympiad across many nations.  \n2.3 Environmental Dominance  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s consistent thesis is that environment (nutrition, health care, larger talent pool) drives improvements. Even poor nations, once developing, produce champions (e.g., Ethiopian distance runners); Chinese state programs rapidly yielded Olympic success. <invalid_quote>\u201cThe Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners\u2026 In 1992, China ranked fourth.\u201d</invalid_quote> This rapid change cannot result from genetic turnover but from environment/training alone within a single generation.\n\n3. Conclusion  \n3.1 Environmental Secular Trends Dominate  \n   \u2022 Continuous record-breaking across multiple generations shows no genetic plateau in sight, implying environment continues to push performance higher.  \n3.2 Generational Lag Prevents Genetic Conclusions  \n   \u2022 Due to 20\u201330 year human generation times, only after many generations can one detect genetic changes from elite mating. The author repeatedly stresses that improvements so far reflect secular environmental change, not genetic selection.  \nTherefore, the correct refutation of the notion that current top athletes will produce better genetic athletic stock is that it is too early\u2014our generational cycle is simply too long, and centuries more of data are needed before genetic effects could manifest.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Athletes have to train so hard for so long that they don't produce very many offspring, which is not a successful strategy for spreading their genetic material.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Race horses, with 1\u20132 year generations and intense artificial selection, still took over a century to plateau. Humans, with 20\u201330 year generations and far less directed breeding, will require many centuries before any genetic ceiling or improvement from champion matings can appear.  \n\n3.

Author\u2019s Emphasis on Environment, Not Genes  \n   \u2022 \u201cEffects of environment, not genes\u201d is the thesis (para. 14).

Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The slow pace of menarche and height changes, the race-horse parallel, and the author\u2019s repeated insistence on environment over many generations all demonstrate that human generational lag prevents us from knowing if elite athlete mating can produce superior genetic stock.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author offer to refute the notion that the best current athletes will produce even better athletes in future generations?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Athletes have to train so hard for so long that they don't produce very many offspring, which is not a successful strategy for spreading their genetic material.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The human generational cycle of 20-30 years is too long for us to know yet what happens when elite athletes reproduce. It will take hundreds of years to find out.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The human generational cycle of 20-30 years is too long for us to know yet what happens when elite athletes reproduce. It will take hundreds of years to find out.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cGenerational Cycle Too Long\u201d Position\n\n1. Primary Textual Support  \n1.1 \u201cEffects of environment, not genes\u201d  \n   \u2022 The author explicitly treats improvements as secular environmental trends that transcend individual lifespans: \u201cJust because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance\u2026 the trends we\u2019re dealing with transcend individual generations.\u201d <quote> You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. </quote>  \n   \u2022 He asks rhetorically whether we will hit a natural limit, emphasizing that records continue to fall across multiple Olympiads and generations: <quote> Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. </quote> Only after \u201chundreds of years\u201d or many generations will long-term genetic effects, if any, become apparent.\n\n1.2 Generational Timescale  \n   \u2022 Humans reproduce every 20\u201330 years, so meaningful genetic shifts require many sequential generations. The persistent secular trends over a century (e.g., menarche age falling by 3\u20134 months per decade) result from environment accumulating gradually, not selective breeding of athletes.  \n   \u2022 The analogy to race horses, which have been under intense artificial selection for centuries yet only recently appear to hit a plateau, underscores that even with rapid generation turnover (1\u20132 years), improvement slows only after long-term breeding: <invalid_quote>\u201cFrom 1850 to 1930\u2026 times dropped. But from 1986 to 1996\u2026 [they] have been 2:39.\u201d</invalid_quote> Humans have far longer generations, so any genetic ceiling remains centuries away.\n\n2. Refuting \u201cTraining Costs Limit Reproduction\u201d Position (Debater_A)  \n2.1 No Textual Evidence for Reproductive Penalty  \n   \u2022 The author speculates merely as a possibility: \u201cGiven the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cPerhaps\u2026 laws of natural selection probably work against athletes\u2026 possibly fewer children.\u201d</invalid_quote> This is a conjecture, not presented as a robust counterforce sufficient to halt long-term athletic improvement.  \n2.2 Contradiction with Continuous Improvement  \n   \u2022 If top athletes\u2019 genes were truly being selected against, we would expect plateauing or regression. Yet, records continually improve every Olympiad across many nations.  \n2.3 Environmental Dominance  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s consistent thesis is that environment (nutrition, health care, larger talent pool) drives improvements. Even poor nations, once developing, produce champions (e.g., Ethiopian distance runners); Chinese state programs rapidly yielded Olympic success. <invalid_quote>\u201cThe Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners\u2026 In 1992, China ranked fourth.\u201d</invalid_quote> This rapid change cannot result from genetic turnover but from environment/training alone within a single generation.\n\n3. Conclusion  \n3.1 Environmental Secular Trends Dominate  \n   \u2022 Continuous record-breaking across multiple generations shows no genetic plateau in sight, implying environment continues to push performance higher.  \n3.2 Generational Lag Prevents Genetic Conclusions  \n   \u2022 Due to 20\u201330 year human generation times, only after many generations can one detect genetic changes from elite mating. The author repeatedly stresses that improvements so far reflect secular environmental change, not genetic selection.  \nTherefore, the correct refutation of the notion that current top athletes will produce better genetic athletic stock is that it is too early\u2014our generational cycle is simply too long, and centuries more of data are needed before genetic effects could manifest.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHard Training Reduces Athlete Reproduction\u201d\n\n1.

Logical Implications  \n   a. If elite performance were heritable and athletes reproduced at average or above rates, we\u2019d expect a genetic ratchet upward in ability. Instead, the author shows continued improvement stems from environmental \u201csecular trends\u201d over only 100 years, far too brief for meaningful genetic change.  \n   b. Race\u2010horse analogy: breeders have been selecting for speed over centuries, yet have plateaued at biomechanical limits (<invalid_quote>\u201cBut from 1986 to 1996\u2026times have been \u20132:39.\u201d</invalid_quote>, para. 15). Humans, unselected genetically due to poor athlete reproduction, have not hit any limit\u2014improvement tracks nutrition, health care, demographics.  \n\n3. Demographic Expansion Argument  \n   a. The pool of healthy potential athletes grows through nonathlete reproduction:  \n      \u2022 Population explosion, rising middle class, better health care produce more genetically average/healthy candidates.  \n      \u2022 These environmental entrants, not offspring of champions, drive record improvements.  \n\n4.

No textual support: Berry never suggests that time alone will reveal a genetic improvement from athlete lineages; rather, he attributes all progress to environment and explicitly notes that natural selection \u201cended long ago.\u201d  \n   b. If athlete genetics mattered, even a few generations (20\u201330 years each) within a century of modern Olympics should yield detectable shifts\u2014but none are observed.

The Chinese case: rapid performance gains in a single generation through state training and nutrition (<quote> China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul.</quote>, para. 13) refute any necessity of multi\u2010generation genetic shifts.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The author\u2019s explicit mention of low athlete fertility as counterselection, combined with universal environmental trends and rapid one\u2010generation improvements via training/nutrition, directly refute any claim that present champions will seed genetically superior lineages. Thus, \u201chard training reduces athlete reproduction\u201d is the correct rationale.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The human generational cycle of 20-30 years is too long for us to know yet what happens when elite athletes reproduce.

Reinforcing the Author\u2019s Explicit \u201cAnti-Selection\u201d Claim  \n   a. Textual Citation as Authoritative, Not Conjectural  \n      \u2022 Debater_B labels low fertility among athletes as \u201cspeculation\u201d (para. 10), yet the author asserts it as a probable mechanism:  \n        <quote> it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. </quote> (para. 10)  \n      \u2022 In context, this statement explains why we see no genetic ratchet despite many Olympiads: the very people with the best genes are those least likely to pass them on. This is the sole genetic argument Berry offers, and he treats it as explanatory.  \n   b. Logical Necessity of Selection Pressure  \n      \u2022 Natural selection requires differential reproductive success. Elite athletes\u2019 \u201crigorous training schedules\u201d directly impede family formation, preventing their superior alleles from propagating.  \n      \u2022 If their genes mattered, even a marginal increase in offspring per champion (e.g., 1.1 vs. 1.0 children) over 100 years would produce measurable gains\u2014but none appear. Instead, performance graphs mirror improving environment, not genotype frequency.  \n\n2. Race-Horse Analogy Undermines Debater_B\u2019s Appeal to Long Timescale  \n   a. Horses Have Short Generations Yet Plateau Quickly  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote> From 1850 to 1930 \u2026 times dropped. But from 1986 to 1996 \u2026 times have been 2:39. </invalid_quote> (para. 15)  \n      \u2022 Race horses, with ~3-year generations and intense selection, have hit an absolute biomechanical limit. Humans, despite 10\u00d7 slower generational turnover, show no plateau because environmental improvements continually recruit new \u201cwild-type\u201d genes from a vast population. If human champions could seed superior lineages, we would see hints of plateauing sooner.  \n   b. Plateau Implies Genetic Limits Already Reached Under Selection  \n      \u2022 Since race-horses plateau at limits unbreached by environment, human records must likewise approach biomechanical ceiling unless bolstered by continual influx of non-champion genotypes. This flux occurs because champions reproduce less, not because we await centuries of breeding.  \n\n3. Rapid Environmental Effects Demonstrate Single-Generation Power  \n   a. Chinese Distance-Runner Case Study  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote> \u201cThe Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners\u2026 In 1992, China ranked fourth.\u201d </invalid_quote> (para. 13)  \n      \u2022 Such dramatic improvements within one generation cannot result from genetic turnover (20\u201330 years/gen) but only from state-of-the-art training, nutrition, and selection of healthy recruits. If genetic effects of champion breeding mattered, China\u2019s nascent program should lag by centuries\u2014yet it does not.  \n   b. African Runners\u2019 Success Rooted in Upbringing, Not Pedigree  \n      \u2022 Ethiopian/Kenyan dominance traceable to childhood training patterns, not inherited Olympian stock. (para. 13) New entrants into the talent pool gain performance immediately through environment.  \n\n4. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cGenerational Lag\u201d Argument  \n   a. Ignores Author\u2019s Claim That Natural Selection \u201cEnded Long Ago\u201d  \n      \u2022 <quote> tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. </quote> (para. 10)  \n      \u2022 Berry posits that modern society\u2019s low selection pressure means athlete genes are not amplified\u2014but instead are diluted. Debater_B\u2019s claim that we simply \u201chaven\u2019t waited long enough\u201d contradicts the author\u2019s central thesis that environment, not genetics, is current driver.  \n   b. No Empirical Trend Toward Genetic Improvement  \n      \u2022 Over a century of measuring menarche age, size, lifespan: changes track nutrition and health, not champion lineage. A hypothetical genetic improvement curve would accelerate relative to environmental improvements but does not.  \n   c. Misreading \u201cTranscend Individual Generations\u201d  \n      \u2022 Berry refers to environmental trends transcending generations to highlight persistence of non-genetic factors, not to postpone any genetic effect indefinitely. Continuous record\u2010breaking into 2044 is premised on ongoing demography and health, not latent athlete genes surfacing \u201cin hundreds of years.\u201d  \n\n5. Population Expansion & \u201cHybrid Vigor\u201d Require Non-Champion Reproduction  \n   a. Hybrid Vigor Arises from General Admixture  \n      \u2022 <quote> migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. </quote> (para. 11)  \n      \u2022 Only large, genetically diverse, healthy non-elite populations can produce hybrid vigor. Elite athletes are an infinitesimal subset insufficient to drive such admixture.  \n   b. Exploding Middle Class Fuels Talent Pool  \n      \u2022 Population growth and rising literacy (para. 7) enlarge the pool of recruits. Champions\u2019 low fertility cannot match this expansion; thus, records improve only by accessing new entrants.  \n\nConclusion  \nBerry\u2019s explicit argument that \u201cnatural selection\u2026 works against athletes\u201d (para. 10), corroborated by rapid one-generation performance leaps and race-horse plateaus under intense breeding, demonstrates that champion genes lack the reproductive success needed to accumulate. Continuous athletic improvements derive exclusively from environmental and demographic secular trends\u2014precisely because elite athletes do not reproduce sufficiently. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cwaiting centuries\u201d thesis conflicts with the author\u2019s core message and real\u2010world analogies, and is unsupported by any observed genetic enhancement.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   \u2022 The author makes clear that all current improvements in athletic performance stem from long-term environmental (\u201csecular\u201d) trends that \u201ctranscend individual generations\u201d <quote> You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. </quote> (para. 14).  \n   \u2022 Because humans reproduce only every 20\u201330 years, any genetic effect of champion athletes marrying and reproducing would require many sequential generations\u2014centuries\u2014to show measurable impact. Until then, we cannot attribute improved records to elite athlete inheritance.  \n\n2. Textual Support for Long-Term Environmental Trends  \n   2.1 Menarche and Size Improvements  \n   \u2022 Age of menarche has fallen \u201cthree or four months per decade \u2026 for the past 150 years\u201d (para. 5). Such slow, gradual change implicates nutrition and health, not rapid genetic selection from champions.  \n   \u2022 Twelve-year-olds in 1990 are nine inches taller than in 1900 (para. 5), again over a century, reflecting diet and health care improvements. If athlete genes dominated, we\u2019d see faster shifts.  \n   2.2 Race-Horse Analogy  \n   \u2022 \u201cFrom 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped \u2026 But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been 2:39\u201d (para. 15). Race horses, with 1\u20132 year generations and intense artificial selection, still took over a century to plateau. Humans, with 20\u201330 year generations and far less directed breeding, will require many centuries before any genetic ceiling or improvement from champion matings can appear.  \n\n3. Rapid One-Generation Gains Imply Environmental Control  \n   \u2022 The Chinese state program produced \u201crecord-breaking female distance runners \u2026 In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul\u201d after only one generation of training and nutrition (para. 13). Such swift change is impossible by genetic turnover and confirms environment\u2019s primacy.  \n   \u2022 Similarly, altitude training for Kenyan/Ethiopian schoolchildren \u201crunning immense distances to and from \u2026 school\u201d (para. 13) yields champions without any genetic change in a single generation.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFewer Offspring\u201d Claim Is Speculative and Insufficient  \n   4.1 \u201cPossible\u201d, Not Demonstrated  \n   \u2022 The author concedes only that \u201cit is possible that today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children\u201d (para. 10) but offers no data. \u201cPossible\u201d is not proof of a strong enough counterselection to arrest athletic improvement.  \n   4.2 Continuous Improvement Contradicts \u201cGenetic Drain\u201d  \n   \u2022 If athletes\u2019 genes were being lost, we would see stagnation or regression\u2014but records \u201ccontinue to tumble \u2026 in Atlanta \u2026 Sydney 2000 \u2026 2044\u201d (para. 16). Improvement remains steady and shows no sign of genetic depletion from low athlete fertility.  \n   4.3 Pool of Non-Athlete Offspring Offsets Any Loss  \n   \u2022 World population \u201cexploded,\u201d \u201cmiddle class \u2026 from which athletes typically are drawn\u201d is growing (para. 9). Even if champions have fewer children, an ever-expanding base of well-nourished, healthy non-athletes supplies more \u201cbigger, better bodies\u201d (para. 4). Their progeny, given superior environment, push records upward.  \n\n5. Author\u2019s Emphasis on Environment, Not Genes  \n   \u2022 \u201cEffects of environment, not genes\u201d is the thesis (para. 14). The author rejects natural selection as driving modern athletic gains: \u201cPerhaps way, way back \u2026 natural selection for athletic prowess \u2026 ended long ago\u201d (para. 10). If genetics mattered, he would credit it\u2014but he does not.  \n   \u2022 He warns that \u201chuman improvement \u2026 must eventually bow to \u2026 biomechanics,\u201d implying that we have not yet hit genetic limits even after centuries of human history. We need much more time to approach any genetic ceiling.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The slow pace of menarche and height changes, the race-horse parallel, and the author\u2019s repeated insistence on environment over many generations all demonstrate that human generational lag prevents us from knowing if elite athlete mating can produce superior genetic stock. Only after centuries\u2014far beyond the 100-year span of modern Olympics\u2014could such genetic influences be detected. The author\u2019s robust environmental explanation suffices for current record improvements; genetic effects from champion reproduction remain speculative and buried under stronger demographic forces.  \n   Therefore, the correct refutation of the notion that today\u2019s best athletes will seed better athletic lineages is that our long 20\u201330 year generation times mean we simply do not yet have the data\u2014and will not for hundreds of years\u2014to observe any genetic payoff. Until then, secular environmental trends explain all observed improvements.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Athletes have to train so hard for so long that they don't produce very many offspring, which is not a successful strategy for spreading their genetic material.\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"The human generational cycle of 20-30 years is too long for us to know yet what happens when elite athletes reproduce. It will take hundreds of years to find out.\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n", "failed": false}}]}
