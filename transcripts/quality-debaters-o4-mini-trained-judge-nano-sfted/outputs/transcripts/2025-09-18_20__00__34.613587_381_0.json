But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma.

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many times does Mrs. Perkins run into Darling in the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Once\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Twice\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Twice\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Twice\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many times does Mrs. Perkins run into Darling in the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Twice\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Once\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Once\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Once\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Why Both Count as \u201cRun\u2010Into\u201d  \n\n  \u2022 \u201cRun into\u201d = an unplanned or unwelcome meeting involving recognition, dialogue, and mutual response. Both episodes are unexpected (Mrs. Perkins is an intruder), involve direct speech and physical proximity, and provoke significant reactions from Darling.  \n  \u2022 Even B\u2019s own criteria for the pirate abduction: they assume she \u201cis\u201d Darling because of her voice and appearance, i.e. they \u201crun into\u201d who they believe is Darling a second time\u2014so proximity and recognition suffice.  \n\n3.

That is a real encounter.  \n\n  B. \u201cOnly Pirate Disguise\u201d Not a Meeting with Darling  \n     \u2022 B wrongly excludes the main lounge because Mrs. Perkins \u201chopes she could get away.\u201d But her very risk and \u201chope\u201d show it\u2019s a purposeful, direct encounter. If \u201choping\u201d risks detection counts as an encounter, we must count it.  \n\n  C. Continuity Requires Second Meeting  \n     \u2022 If Mrs. Perkins never re\u2010entered the lounge, how else could she \u201clearned who you were\u2026 I opened the hatch\u201d to abduct on pirates? She must have observed or gleaned information at the second lounge appearance, gathering details on Darling\u2019s identity, cabin location, and schedule. That knowledge isn\u2019t available in the single suite incident.  \n\n4. Logical and Narrative Coherence  \n\n  \u2022 Character Motivation: Mrs. Perkins is \u201cbored\u201d and \u201chopes she could get away with\u201d a second lounge infiltration to \u201cthink\u201d and \u201cobserve\u201d the first\u2010class passengers. She would have no reason or opportunity to orchestrate her own abduction otherwise.  \n  \u2022 B\u2019s \u201conce\u201d ignores this narrative drive: without the second encounter, the pirates cannot mistake her for Darling, making the entire pirate episode impossible.  \n\n5. Precedent and Plain Reading  \n\n  \u2022 Ordinary usage: if you \u201crun into\u201d someone, leave, then trespass deliberately to see them again, you have run into them twice.  \n  \u2022 The story\u2019s repeated \u201cmet this afternoon\u201d phrasing and Darling\u2019s horrified response confirm two distinct \u201cmeetings.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nTextual citations, plot necessity, and commonsense language usage all compel the answer \u201cTwice.\u201d B\u2019s \u201conce\u201d fails to account for Mrs. Perkins\u2019s re\u2010entry into the lounge, her subsequent direct dialogue with Darling, and the crucial information she obtains there that propels the pirate kidnapping. Therefore, \u201cTwice\u201d is the only answer consistent with the full narrative.",

Second Encounter\u2014Main Lounge Re\u2010entry  \n     \u2022 Mrs. Perkins \u201cmoved \u2026 to one of the very comfortable sofas in the main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there\u2026\u201d <quote>\u201cDarling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\u201d</quote>  \n     \u2022 Darling & Carlton \u201cstrolled over and sat down across from her\u2026 Darling muttered a few choice words\u2026 Then rose silently and tip\u2010toed out.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Direct mutual recognition (\u201cwe met this afternoon\u201d), explicit address, and subsequent dialogue (insults, forced departure).  \n\n2. Why Both Count as \u201cRun\u2010Into\u201d  \n\n  \u2022 \u201cRun into\u201d = an unplanned or unwelcome meeting involving recognition, dialogue, and mutual response. Both episodes are unexpected (Mrs. Perkins is an intruder), involve direct speech and physical proximity, and provoke significant reactions from Darling.  \n  \u2022 Even B\u2019s own criteria for the pirate abduction: they assume she \u201cis\u201d Darling because of her voice and appearance, i.e. they \u201crun into\u201d who they believe is Darling a second time\u2014so proximity and recognition suffice.  \n\n3. Refuting \u201cOnce\u201d Arguments  \n\n  A. \u201cNo Interaction in Lounge\u201d Claim Fails  \n     \u2022 B admits \u201cstrolled over\u2026 across from her\u201d but claims \u201cno speak or touch.\u201d Yet the text records Darling\u2019s verbal \u201cmuttered\u2026 choice words,\u201d and the Captain\u2019s reaction \u201ctook command\u201d\u2014all caused by Mrs. Perkins\u2019s presence <quote>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</quote>. That is a real encounter.  \n\n  B. \u201cOnly Pirate Disguise\u201d Not a Meeting with Darling  \n     \u2022 B wrongly excludes the main lounge because Mrs. Perkins \u201chopes she could get away.\u201d But her very risk and \u201chope\u201d show it\u2019s a purposeful, direct encounter. If \u201choping\u201d risks detection counts as an encounter, we must count it.  \n\n  C. Continuity Requires Second Meeting  \n     \u2022 If Mrs. Perkins never re\u2010entered the lounge, how else could she \u201clearned who you were\u2026 I opened the hatch\u201d to abduct on pirates? She must have observed or gleaned information at the second lounge appearance, gathering details on Darling\u2019s identity, cabin location, and schedule. That knowledge isn\u2019t available in the single suite incident.  \n\n4. Logical and Narrative Coherence  \n\n  \u2022 Character Motivation: Mrs. Perkins is \u201cbored\u201d and \u201chopes she could get away with\u201d a second lounge infiltration to \u201cthink\u201d and \u201cobserve\u201d the first\u2010class passengers. She would have no reason or opportunity to orchestrate her own abduction otherwise.  \n  \u2022 B\u2019s \u201conce\u201d ignores this narrative drive: without the second encounter, the pirates cannot mistake her for Darling, making the entire pirate episode impossible.  \n\n5. Precedent and Plain Reading  \n\n  \u2022 Ordinary usage: if you \u201crun into\u201d someone, leave, then trespass deliberately to see them again, you have run into them twice.  \n  \u2022 The story\u2019s repeated \u201cmet this afternoon\u201d phrasing and Darling\u2019s horrified response confirm two distinct \u201cmeetings.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nTextual citations, plot necessity, and commonsense language usage all compel the answer \u201cTwice.\u201d B\u2019s \u201conce\u201d fails to account for Mrs. Perkins\u2019s re\u2010entry into the lounge, her subsequent direct dialogue with Darling, and the crucial information she obtains there that propels the pirate kidnapping. Therefore, \u201cTwice\u201d is the only answer consistent with the full narrative.",

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many times does Mrs. Perkins run into Darling in the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Once\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Twice\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Twice\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI affirm that Mrs. Perkins \u201cruns into\u201d Darling Toujours twice, not once. My opponent\u2019s \u201conce\u201d counts only their first chance meeting, but overlooks the second encounter in the main lounge shortly afterward. I will:  \n1. Cite both meetings.  \n2. Show why the second meeting qualifies as \u201crunning into.\u201d  \n3. Critique the \u201conce\u201d argument as incomplete.  \n\nArguments for \u201cTwice\u201d  \nA. First Encounter in First-Class Lounge (Scene I)  \n  1. \u201cMrs. Perkins\u201d interrupts Darling\u2019s attempted slap:  \n     \u2013 <quote>in mid-air, as she turned to see a newcomer standing at the door. The</quote> (p.1)  \n     \u2013 Darling reacts with surprise: \u201cI was just going to pat him \u2026 Why I was \u2026\u201d  \n  2. Darling and Carlton forcibly eject Mrs. Perkins:  \n     \u2013 <quote>\"Captain, this woman must GO!\"</quote>  \n\nB. Second Encounter in Main Lounge (Scene I, later that evening)  \n  1. Mrs. Perkins deliberately re-enters the main lounge to observe passengers:  \n     \u2013 <quote> she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. </quote>  \n  2. Darling and Carlton again identify and shun her:  \n     \u2013 <quote>her. \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this</quote>  \n     \u2013 Both \u201cstrolled over and sat down across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Eventually Darling and Carlton leave: \u201cDarling muttered \u2026 They rose silently and tip-toed out.\u201d  \n\nC. Both Encounters Involve Direct Interaction  \n  1. Physical proximity in the same confined lounge.  \n  2. Darling\u2019s behavior changes in direct response to Mrs. Perkins both times (attempted slap vs. gossip/insults).  \n  3. Mrs. Perkins\u2019s aim in both is the same: observe or manipulate, thus purposeful \u201crunning into.\u201d  \n\nWhy the Second Meeting Counts  \n  \u2013 It is a separate, deliberate appearance after being ejected <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen Jenny looked \u2026 cabin was empty \u2026 The food \u2026 Darling \u2026 were seated there.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2013 \u201cRunning into\u201d implies repeated chance or engineered encounters. She \u201chopes she could get away with it,\u201d implying risk and repeat engagement.  \n\nCritique of \u201cOnce\u201d Position  \n  1. Opponent misreads \u201cmeeting\u201d as \u201ccapture in airlock.\u201d The airlock scene is with pirates, not a \u201crun-in\u201d with Darling. Darling never re-appears after the lounge until rescue.  \n  2. Opponent\u2019s reliance on \u201conly first time they meet\u201d ignores clear text: <invalid_quote>\u201cDarling Toujours muttered \u2026 Then \u2026 returned for her pictures.\u201d</invalid_quote> is a distinct second.  \n  3. The legal contract scene with Johnny and subsequent lounge entrance is Mrs. Perkins\u2019s deliberate second infiltration. The story\u2019s phrasing \u201cthey finished up their food and then she moved \u2026\u201d marks two visitations by Mrs. Perkins.  \n\nConclusion  \nMrs. Perkins \u201cruns into\u201d Darling Toujours in the first-class lounge at least twice: the initial intrusion and forced exit, and the later re-entry to gossip and present her \u201cfamily pictures.\u201d The text unmistakably records these separate episodes, satisfying the plain meaning of \u201crun into.\u201d The \u201conce\u201d theory ignores the narrative\u2019s explicit second meeting and misclassifies the airlock scene. I urge the Judge to recognize \u201cTwice\u201d as the only answer that fully accounts for the evidence.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement (Position: \u201cOnce\u201d)\n\n1. Definition of \u201cRun Into\u201d  \n   \u2022 I adopt the natural, context-driven meaning of \u201crun into\u201d: a direct encounter in which Mrs. Perkins and Darling are in personal contact, recognize one another, and interact. Mere overhearing or remote sighting does not count as \u201crunning into\u201d someone.\n\n2. Only One Direct Encounter Occurs  \n   \u2022 The sole personal meeting is in the first-class lounge, post-prandial on the Kismet, when Mrs. Perkins interrupts Darling and Carlton E. Carlton:  \n     \u2013 \u201cI was just leaving\u2026 I hope you and your son have a very happy voyage\u201d and Darling \u201csnatched the nightie away.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 After removing her, Mrs. Perkins departs; Darling never again confronts her directly.  \n   \u2022 All subsequent interactions are either:  \n     a. Remote/eavesdropping (e.g. \u201cGrandma moved from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but she hoped that she could get away with it.\u201d \u2013 no direct contact, and Darling & Carlton tiptoe away)  \n     b. Indirect rescue/disguise on pirate ship \u2013 Darling never recognizes her; Mrs. Perkins is impersonating Darling, not vice-versa.  \n     c. Overheard by pirates but no Darling present.\n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s Miscount of \u201cEncounters\u201d  \n   \u2022 Claim of second \u201crun-in\u201d at the main lounge: This is not a personal meeting but mere proximity. Darling & Carlton do not speak to or touch Mrs. Perkins at that time; they simply notice and leave: \u201cDarling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently and tip-toed out of the lounge.\u201d There is no interaction or recognition stage.  \n   \u2022 Claim of \u201cencounters\u201d via remote observation (e.g. eavesdropping at bridge hatch): Mrs. Perkins is overhearing the Kismet crew\u2019s conversation, not encountering Darling. And Darling is no longer aboard.  \n   \u2022 Dress-removal on pirate ship is Mrs. Perkins\u2019s contrivance and Darling is absent. By Debater_A\u2019s logic, disguises or proxy appearances don\u2019t constitute runs-in; consistency demands that Mrs. Perkins\u2019s masquerade doesn\u2019t count as a separate encounter either, and it certainly isn\u2019t Darling.\n\n4. Narrative Continuity and Single Abduction Rationale  \n   \u2022 Mrs. Perkins\u2019s entire pirate \u201cadventure\u201d depends on her initial mistaken identity. If Darling had ever directly confronted her a second time, the pirates\u2019 plan collapses. The story never permits Darling to discover Mrs. Perkins is not herself a second time.  \n   \u2022 At the next port, \u201cthe environment would be full of want to see Darling Toujours,\u201d so the pirates transport Mrs. Perkins under the assumption she is Darling. No second run-in occurs on the Kismet\u2014once she leaves, she never returns.  \n   \u2022 The judge must interpret \u201crun into\u201d as a tangible meeting; a plot device like overhearing or an impersonation (on which Debater_A relies for extra \u201cmeetings\u201d) does not override the singular, explicit lounge encounter.\n\n5. Logical Simplicity  \n   \u2022 Occam\u2019s razor favors \u201cOnce\u201d: the text presents precisely one clear incident of direct, acknowledged meeting. No other instance fulfills all \u201crun-into\u201d criteria.  \n\nConclusion  \nThere is precisely one direct, interactive encounter between Mrs. Perkins and Darling Toujours\u2014when Mrs. Perkins first intrudes into Darling\u2019s suite in the first-class lounge. All other \u201cmeetings\u201d are either one-sided, indirect, or post-departure impersonations. Therefore, \u201cOnce\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Twice\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Consistency demands only mutual, acknowledged meetings count.  \n\n4. Narrative and Logical Consistency  \n   A. Plot\u2019s Reliance on Single Mistaken Identity  \n     \u2013 The pirates\u2019 entire plan depends on the one initial intrusion convincing them she is Darling. If there had been a second direct confrontation on Kismet, Darling would have recognized her as imposter and raised the alarm, foiling the pirate abduction.  \n     \u2013 The story never portrays Darling\u2019s second suspicion or recognition; they remain unaware until after departure.  \n\n   B. Avoidance of Post-Capture \u201cMeetings\u201d  \n     \u2013 The airlock scene and pirate sequences are with lamps and crew, not Darling. Debater_A\u2019s misreading cannot conjure Darling\u2019s presence.  \n     \u2013 Mrs. Perkins never returns to the Kismet; thus no chance for further \u201crun-ins.\u201d  \n\n5. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s Arguments  \n   A. Conflates Proximity with Encounter  \n     \u2013 \u201cStrolling over\u201d and silent exit are passive avoidance, not encounters. No spoken words directed at Mrs. Perkins.  \n     \u2013 Their \u201cnot recognizing her at first\u201d cannot retrospectively create a \u201crecognition\u201d meeting\u2014they never engage, merely flee upon belated spotting.  \n\n   B. Misapplies \u201cRun Into\u201d to Engine and Cabin Scenes  \n     \u2013 Overhearing bridge dialogue and pirate kidnapping involve no Darling. Counting these would multiply \u201cmeetings\u201d to pirates, not Darling. They admit only meetings with Darling count.  \n\n6. Occam\u2019s Razor: Simplest Reading Fits \u201cOnce\u201d  \n   \u2013 Only one explicit, textual event where Darling directly confronts and interacts. All other passages involve one-sided observation, eavesdropping, or non-continuous presence without recognition or disturbance.  \n   \u2013 To claim more \u201cruns-in\u201d requires stretching \u201crun into\u201d to meaningless proximity, undermining any coherent standard.\n\nConclusion  \nThere is precisely one direct, mutually recognized, interactive meeting between Mrs. Perkins and Darling Toujours\u2014when Mrs. Perkins first intrudes in the first-class lounge.

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many times does Mrs. Perkins run into Darling in the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Twice\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Once\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Once\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement (Position: \u201cOnce\u201d)\n\n1.

Carlton:  \n     \u2013 \u201cI was just leaving\u2026 I hope you and your son have a very happy voyage\u201d and Darling \u201csnatched the nightie away.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 After removing her, Mrs. Perkins departs; Darling never again confronts her directly.  \n   \u2022 All subsequent interactions are either:  \n     a. Remote/eavesdropping (e.g. \u201cGrandma moved from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but she hoped that she could get away with it.\u201d \u2013 no direct contact, and Darling & Carlton tiptoe away)  \n     b. Indirect rescue/disguise on pirate ship \u2013 Darling never recognizes her; Mrs. Perkins is impersonating Darling, not vice-versa.  \n     c. Overheard by pirates but no Darling present.\n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s Miscount of \u201cEncounters\u201d  \n   \u2022 Claim of second \u201crun-in\u201d at the main lounge: This is not a personal meeting but mere proximity. Darling & Carlton do not speak to or touch Mrs. Perkins at that time; they simply notice and leave: \u201cDarling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently and tip-toed out of the lounge.\u201d There is no interaction or recognition stage.  \n   \u2022 Claim of \u201cencounters\u201d via remote observation (e.g. eavesdropping at bridge hatch): Mrs. Perkins is overhearing the Kismet crew\u2019s conversation, not encountering Darling. And Darling is no longer aboard.  \n   \u2022 Dress-removal on pirate ship is Mrs. Perkins\u2019s contrivance and Darling is absent. By Debater_A\u2019s logic, disguises or proxy appearances don\u2019t constitute runs-in; consistency demands that Mrs. Perkins\u2019s masquerade doesn\u2019t count as a separate encounter either, and it certainly isn\u2019t Darling.\n\n4. Narrative Continuity and Single Abduction Rationale  \n   \u2022 Mrs. Perkins\u2019s entire pirate \u201cadventure\u201d depends on her initial mistaken identity. If Darling had ever directly confronted her a second time, the pirates\u2019 plan collapses. The story never permits Darling to discover Mrs. Perkins is not herself a second time.  \n   \u2022 At the next port, \u201cthe environment would be full of want to see Darling Toujours,\u201d so the pirates transport Mrs. Perkins under the assumption she is Darling. No second run-in occurs on the Kismet\u2014once she leaves, she never returns.  \n   \u2022 The judge must interpret \u201crun into\u201d as a tangible meeting; a plot device like overhearing or an impersonation (on which Debater_A relies for extra \u201cmeetings\u201d) does not override the singular, explicit lounge encounter.\n\n5. Logical Simplicity  \n   \u2022 Occam\u2019s razor favors \u201cOnce\u201d: the text presents precisely one clear incident of direct, acknowledged meeting. No other instance fulfills all \u201crun-into\u201d criteria.  \n\nConclusion  \nThere is precisely one direct, interactive encounter between Mrs. Perkins and Darling Toujours\u2014when Mrs. Perkins first intrudes into Darling\u2019s suite in the first-class lounge. All other \u201cmeetings\u201d are either one-sided, indirect, or post-departure impersonations. Therefore, \u201cOnce\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI affirm that Mrs. Perkins \u201cruns into\u201d Darling Toujours twice, not once. My opponent\u2019s \u201conce\u201d counts only their first chance meeting, but overlooks the second encounter in the main lounge shortly afterward. I will:  \n1. Cite both meetings.  \n2. Show why the second meeting qualifies as \u201crunning into.\u201d  \n3. Critique the \u201conce\u201d argument as incomplete.  \n\nArguments for \u201cTwice\u201d  \nA. First Encounter in First-Class Lounge (Scene I)  \n  1. \u201cMrs. Perkins\u201d interrupts Darling\u2019s attempted slap:  \n     \u2013 <quote>in mid-air, as she turned to see a newcomer standing at the door.

Darling and Carlton forcibly eject Mrs. Perkins:  \n     \u2013 <quote>\"Captain, this woman must GO!\"</quote>  \n\nB. Second Encounter in Main Lounge (Scene I, later that evening)  \n  1. Mrs. Perkins deliberately re-enters the main lounge to observe passengers:  \n     \u2013 <quote> she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. </quote>  \n  2. Darling and Carlton again identify and shun her:  \n     \u2013 <quote>her. \"Darling!

Then Carlton spied her.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Eventually Darling and Carlton leave: \u201cDarling muttered \u2026 They rose silently and tip-toed out.\u201d  \n\nC. Both Encounters Involve Direct Interaction  \n  1. Physical proximity in the same confined lounge.  \n  2. Darling\u2019s behavior changes in direct response to Mrs. Perkins both times (attempted slap vs. gossip/insults).  \n  3. Mrs. Perkins\u2019s aim in both is the same: observe or manipulate, thus purposeful \u201crunning into.\u201d  \n\nWhy the Second Meeting Counts  \n  \u2013 It is a separate, deliberate appearance after being ejected <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen Jenny looked \u2026 cabin was empty \u2026 The food \u2026 Darling \u2026 were seated there.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2013 \u201cRunning into\u201d implies repeated chance or engineered encounters. She \u201chopes she could get away with it,\u201d implying risk and repeat engagement.  \n\nCritique of \u201cOnce\u201d Position  \n  1. Opponent misreads \u201cmeeting\u201d as \u201ccapture in airlock.\u201d The airlock scene is with pirates, not a \u201crun-in\u201d with Darling. Darling never re-appears after the lounge until rescue.  \n  2. Opponent\u2019s reliance on \u201conly first time they meet\u201d ignores clear text: <invalid_quote>\u201cDarling Toujours muttered \u2026 Then \u2026 returned for her pictures.\u201d</invalid_quote> is a distinct second.  \n  3. The legal contract scene with Johnny and subsequent lounge entrance is Mrs. Perkins\u2019s deliberate second infiltration. The story\u2019s phrasing \u201cthey finished up their food and then she moved \u2026\u201d marks two visitations by Mrs. Perkins.  \n\nConclusion  \nMrs. Perkins \u201cruns into\u201d Darling Toujours in the first-class lounge at least twice: the initial intrusion and forced exit, and the later re-entry to gossip and present her \u201cfamily pictures.\u201d The text unmistakably records these separate episodes, satisfying the plain meaning of \u201crun into.\u201d The \u201conce\u201d theory ignores the narrative\u2019s explicit second meeting and misclassifies the airlock scene.

Definition of \u201cRun Into\u201d  \n   \u2022 I adopt the natural, context-driven meaning of \u201crun into\u201d: a direct encounter in which Mrs. Perkins and Darling are in personal contact, recognize one another, and interact. Mere overhearing or remote sighting does not count as \u201crunning into\u201d someone.\n\n2. Only One Direct Encounter Occurs  \n   \u2022 The sole personal meeting is in the first-class lounge, post-prandial on the Kismet, when Mrs. Perkins interrupts Darling and Carlton E. Carlton:  \n     \u2013 \u201cI was just leaving\u2026 I hope you and your son have a very happy voyage\u201d and Darling \u201csnatched the nightie away.\u201d (background)  \n     \u2013 After removing her, Mrs. Perkins departs; Darling never again confronts her directly.  \n   \u2022 All subsequent interactions are either:  \n     a.

Indirect rescue/disguise on pirate ship \u2013 Darling never recognizes her; Mrs. Perkins is impersonating Darling, not vice-versa.  \n     c. Overheard by pirates but no Darling present.\n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s Miscount of \u201cEncounters\u201d  \n   \u2022 Claim of second \u201crun-in\u201d at the main lounge: This is not a personal meeting but mere proximity. Darling & Carlton do not speak to or touch Mrs. Perkins at that time; they simply notice and leave: \u201cDarling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently and tip-toed out of the lounge.\u201d There is no interaction or recognition stage.  \n   \u2022 Claim of \u201cencounters\u201d via remote observation (e.g. eavesdropping at bridge hatch): Mrs. Perkins is overhearing the Kismet crew\u2019s conversation, not encountering Darling.

If Darling had ever directly confronted her a second time, the pirates\u2019 plan collapses.

No other instance fulfills all \u201crun-into\u201d criteria.  \n\nConclusion  \nThere is precisely one direct, interactive encounter between Mrs. Perkins and Darling Toujours\u2014when Mrs. Perkins first intrudes into Darling\u2019s suite in the first-class lounge. All other \u201cmeetings\u201d are either one-sided, indirect, or post-departure impersonations. Therefore, \u201cOnce\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument Summary  \nI maintain Mrs. Perkins \u201cruns into\u201d Darling Toujours twice on the Kismet: (1) the initial forced\u2010entry into Darling\u2019s suite, and (2) the later re\u2010entry into the main lounge where she and Darling directly interact again. B\u2019s \u201conce\u201d counts only the first and dismisses the second as \u201cmere proximity,\u201d but the text shows clear, mutual recognition and dialogue both times\u2014fulfilling any reasonable definition of \u201crunning into\u201d someone.\n\n1. First, the Textual Evidence of Two Encounters  \n\n  A. First Encounter\u2014Suite Intrusion  \n     \u2022 \u201cHer hand froze\u2026 as she turned to see a newcomer standing at the door.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI hope you didn\u2019t interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the gentleman\u2026 I\u2019m Mrs. Omar K. Perkins\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.1)  \n     \u2022 Darling \u201csnatched the nightie away\u2026 \u2018Captain, this woman must GO!\u2019\u201d <quote>just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very happy voyage.</quote>  \n     \u2013 Direct contact, confusion, dialogue, and forced ejection.  \n\n  B. Second Encounter\u2014Main Lounge Re\u2010entry  \n     \u2022 Mrs. Perkins \u201cmoved \u2026 to one of the very comfortable sofas in the main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there\u2026\u201d <quote>\"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"</quote>  \n     \u2022 Darling & Carlton \u201cstrolled over and sat down across from her\u2026 Darling muttered a few choice words\u2026 Then rose silently and tip\u2010toed out.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Direct mutual recognition (\u201cwe met this afternoon\u201d), explicit address, and subsequent dialogue (insults, forced departure).  \n\n2. Why Both Count as \u201cRun\u2010Into\u201d  \n\n  \u2022 \u201cRun into\u201d = an unplanned or unwelcome meeting involving recognition, dialogue, and mutual response. Both episodes are unexpected (Mrs. Perkins is an intruder), involve direct speech and physical proximity, and provoke significant reactions from Darling.  \n  \u2022 Even B\u2019s own criteria for the pirate abduction: they assume she \u201cis\u201d Darling because of her voice and appearance, i.e. they \u201crun into\u201d who they believe is Darling a second time\u2014so proximity and recognition suffice.  \n\n3. Refuting \u201cOnce\u201d Arguments  \n\n  A. \u201cNo Interaction in Lounge\u201d Claim Fails  \n     \u2022 B admits \u201cstrolled over\u2026 across from her\u201d but claims \u201cno speak or touch.\u201d Yet the text records Darling\u2019s verbal \u201cmuttered\u2026 choice words,\u201d and the Captain\u2019s reaction \u201ctook command\u201d\u2014all caused by Mrs. Perkins\u2019s presence <invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>. That is a real encounter.  \n\n  B. \u201cOnly Pirate Disguise\u201d Not a Meeting with Darling  \n     \u2022 B wrongly excludes the main lounge because Mrs. Perkins \u201chopes she could get away.\u201d But her very risk and \u201chope\u201d show it\u2019s a purposeful, direct encounter. If \u201choping\u201d risks detection counts as an encounter, we must count it.  \n\n  C. Continuity Requires Second Meeting  \n     \u2022 If Mrs. Perkins never re\u2010entered the lounge, how else could she \u201clearned who you were\u2026 I opened the hatch\u201d to abduct on pirates? She must have observed or gleaned information at the second lounge appearance, gathering details on Darling\u2019s identity, cabin location, and schedule. That knowledge isn\u2019t available in the single suite incident.  \n\n4. Logical and Narrative Coherence  \n\n  \u2022 Character Motivation: Mrs. Perkins is \u201cbored\u201d and \u201chopes she could get away with\u201d a second lounge infiltration to \u201cthink\u201d and \u201cobserve\u201d the first\u2010class passengers. She would have no reason or opportunity to orchestrate her own abduction otherwise.  \n  \u2022 B\u2019s \u201conce\u201d ignores this narrative drive: without the second encounter, the pirates cannot mistake her for Darling, making the entire pirate episode impossible.  \n\n5. Precedent and Plain Reading  \n\n  \u2022 Ordinary usage: if you \u201crun into\u201d someone, leave, then trespass deliberately to see them again, you have run into them twice.  \n  \u2022 The story\u2019s repeated \u201cmet this afternoon\u201d phrasing and Darling\u2019s horrified response confirm two distinct \u201cmeetings.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nTextual citations, plot necessity, and commonsense language usage all compel the answer \u201cTwice.\u201d B\u2019s \u201conce\u201d fails to account for Mrs. Perkins\u2019s re\u2010entry into the lounge, her subsequent direct dialogue with Darling, and the crucial information she obtains there that propels the pirate kidnapping. Therefore, \u201cTwice\u201d is the only answer consistent with the full narrative.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Rebuttal and Defense (Position: \u201cOnce\u201d)  \n\n1. Restating Our Definition of \u201cRun Into\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cRun into\u201d requires:  \n     a. Mutual recognition (\u201cshe saw and was seen\u201d)  \n     b. Direct interaction (speech, touch, forced removal, emotional response)  \n     c. A distinct, non-continuous event separated by meeting and departure  \n\n2. Only One Qualifying Meeting Occurs  \n   A. First-Class Lounge Intrusion (Scene I)  \n     \u2013 Text: \u201cHer hand froze\u2026 she turned to see a newcomer standing at the door.\u201d (p.1) <quote>\"Captain, this woman must GO!\"</quote>  \n     \u2013 Darling reacts with \u201csmall fit of hysteria,\u201d \u201csnatched the nightie,\u201d and \u201cpropelled the older woman out.\u201d  \n     \u2013 Fulfills all criteria: recognition, speech, physical interaction, emotional disturbance.  \n     \u2013 They retreat to the Captain\u2019s table afterward; Mrs. Perkins disappears.  \n\n3. The Alleged \u201cSecond\u201d Encounter Fails All Criteria  \n   A. No Recognition or Interaction  \n     \u2013 Text: \u201cIn reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but she hoped that she could get away with it.\u201d (p.?) <invalid_quote>\u201cDarling and Carlton\u2026not recognizing her at first.\u201d</invalid_quote> They \u201crose silently\u2026and tip-toed out.\u201d  \n     \u2013 They do not speak to her, touch her, or forcibly remove her. Their \u201chorrified glances\u201d and silent exit indicate avoidance, not interaction.  \n     \u2013 A \u201crun-into\u201d cannot be counted if one party deliberately ignores or does not engage.  \n\n   B. One-Sided Eavesdropping, Not a Meeting  \n     \u2013 Mrs. Perkins then goes on to eavesdrop at the bridge hatch and is carried off by pirates. Darling is long gone. No further direct encounters.  \n     \u2013 If mere proximity counted, then the pirates\u2019 confusion of Mrs. Perkins for Darling (p.?) would count as a \u201crun-into,\u201d yet Debater_A excludes those. Consistency demands only mutual, acknowledged meetings count.  \n\n4. Narrative and Logical Consistency  \n   A. Plot\u2019s Reliance on Single Mistaken Identity  \n     \u2013 The pirates\u2019 entire plan depends on the one initial intrusion convincing them she is Darling. If there had been a second direct confrontation on Kismet, Darling would have recognized her as imposter and raised the alarm, foiling the pirate abduction.  \n     \u2013 The story never portrays Darling\u2019s second suspicion or recognition; they remain unaware until after departure.  \n\n   B. Avoidance of Post-Capture \u201cMeetings\u201d  \n     \u2013 The airlock scene and pirate sequences are with lamps and crew, not Darling. Debater_A\u2019s misreading cannot conjure Darling\u2019s presence.  \n     \u2013 Mrs. Perkins never returns to the Kismet; thus no chance for further \u201crun-ins.\u201d  \n\n5. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s Arguments  \n   A. Conflates Proximity with Encounter  \n     \u2013 \u201cStrolling over\u201d and silent exit are passive avoidance, not encounters. No spoken words directed at Mrs. Perkins.  \n     \u2013 Their \u201cnot recognizing her at first\u201d cannot retrospectively create a \u201crecognition\u201d meeting\u2014they never engage, merely flee upon belated spotting.  \n\n   B. Misapplies \u201cRun Into\u201d to Engine and Cabin Scenes  \n     \u2013 Overhearing bridge dialogue and pirate kidnapping involve no Darling. Counting these would multiply \u201cmeetings\u201d to pirates, not Darling. They admit only meetings with Darling count.  \n\n6. Occam\u2019s Razor: Simplest Reading Fits \u201cOnce\u201d  \n   \u2013 Only one explicit, textual event where Darling directly confronts and interacts. All other passages involve one-sided observation, eavesdropping, or non-continuous presence without recognition or disturbance.  \n   \u2013 To claim more \u201cruns-in\u201d requires stretching \u201crun into\u201d to meaningless proximity, undermining any coherent standard.\n\nConclusion  \nThere is precisely one direct, mutually recognized, interactive meeting between Mrs. Perkins and Darling Toujours\u2014when Mrs. Perkins first intrudes in the first-class lounge. No other scene meets the criteria of recognition, speech, or physical interaction. All subsequent sightings are Darling\u2019s avoidance or involve only the pirates. Therefore, \u201cOnce\u201d is the only correct answer.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
