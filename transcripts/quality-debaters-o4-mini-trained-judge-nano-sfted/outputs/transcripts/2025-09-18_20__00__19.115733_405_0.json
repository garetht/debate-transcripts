    "background_text": "The Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.

Exposition Without Peril Would Undercut Tension  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cpurely to teach the reader\u201d fails to explain repeated warnings that \u201cI wish you\u2019d let me break up the show \u2026 butchery gets on my nerves\u201d (quote): the crew\u2019s aversion suggests danger they both recognize, not mere academic curiosity. Why risk a team member onshore when they could scan \u201cdaylight side\u201d? Because narrative suspense demands the gamble.  \n\n2. Pattern of \u201cShow\u201d Emphasizes Sport and Stakes  \n  \u2022 The parallel between Arzian fishers as bait and Arthur\u2019s fate (\u201cnow I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d) (quote) is a thematic mirror\u2014Arthur\u2019s experience makes the reader viscerally understand the \u201cAnglers of Arz.\u201d This immersive identification is a suspense technique, not a dry exposition.  \n\n3. Regulation Breach Motivated by Obsession and Risk  \n  \u2022 Arthur\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve got to know\u201d (quote) is almost an admission of compulsion, mirroring Gibson\u2019s fixation; yet Gibson searched by scouter for days without danger. This contrast underlines that Arthur\u2019s ground\u2010level foray is an extraordinary, suspense\u2010driven gamble.  \n\nConclusion  \nArthur\u2019s illicit night\u2010time exploration, his capture, and near\u2010death ordeal are classic narrative devices to build suspense, empathy, and dramatic payoff. The delayed discovery of the city only after this crisis underscores that his peril is the means by which both crew and reader gain critical knowledge\u2014and makes the theme of \u201cfishing inverted\u201d viscerally effective. The text\u2019s structure\u2014pattern, breach, jeopardy, rescue, revelation\u2014follows the suspense arc, not a mere expository tutorial.",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Arthur\u2019s fallible but curious viewpoint lets the reader piece together the clues. His partial success heightens trust in the solution.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpure suspense\u201d reading is inadequate.  \n   a. Suspense alone would demand a cliffhanger, not immediate expository payoff.

If suspense were sole motive, why then immediately abandon Arz without further exploration (pp.12\u201313)? Suspense\u2010only would prolong the investigation, not terminate it. The author ends the story once the reader\u2019s questions are answered, confirming purpose.  \n   c. Stryker\u2019s premeditated drugging (p.9) and Arthur\u2019s helplessness show the stakes are necessary to establish credibility of the solution; without it, the mechanism (squid subjugation/transport) would be hypothetical and unconvincing.  \n\n4.

Only by risking Arthur can the author \u201cshow\u201d rather than \u201ctell\u201d the mechanics of the squid culture.  \n   c. Arthur\u2019s fallible but curious viewpoint lets the reader piece together the clues. His partial success heightens trust in the solution.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpure suspense\u201d reading is inadequate.  \n   a. Suspense alone would demand a cliffhanger, not immediate expository payoff. Here the author offers prompt full explanation (pp.11\u201312) \u2013 a hallmark of \u201cmystery solved\u201d narrative, not mere tension technique.  \n   b. If suspense were sole motive, why then immediately abandon Arz without further exploration (pp.12\u201313)? Suspense\u2010only would prolong the investigation, not terminate it. The author ends the story once the reader\u2019s questions are answered, confirming purpose.  \n   c. Stryker\u2019s premeditated drugging (p.9) and Arthur\u2019s helplessness show the stakes are necessary to establish credibility of the solution; without it, the mechanism (squid subjugation/transport) would be hypothetical and unconvincing.  \n\n4. Thematic economy:  \n   \u2013 The story is a concise science\u2010fiction \u201ctwist\u201d tale common in IF Worlds comps: introduce a puzzle, let a surrogate (Arthur) solve it, and end.  \n   \u2013 This structure emphasizes the \u201clearning moment\u201d over drawn\u2010out peril, matching the genre\u2019s preference for intellectual payoff.  \n\nConclusion  \nArthur\u2019s forbidden night exploration is the essential narrative device that turns the reader\u2019s shared mysteries into concrete answers, not merely a way to manufacture temporary suspense.",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Narrative Follows a Suspense Arc, Not a Mere \u201cMystery Tour\u201d  \n1.

The story ends because the *tension* has been resolved.  \n\n2.

The author deliberately courts reader fear to *heighten* impact of discovery.  \n\nII. Ground\u2010Level Viewpoint Immerses Reader in \u201cReverse Angling\u201d Theme  \n1. Identification Through Danger  \n  \u2022 Arthur\u2019s terror\u2014\u201cpanic seized him,\u201d \u201cfaint with relief\u201d <quote>now I'm one of the cast .</quote>\u2014makes us viscerally grasp that the Arzians/fishers are themselves bait. The theme of \u201cinverted angling\u201d only resonates if the protagonist *experiences* it. Pure scanning from the ship would leave it abstract.  \n\n2. The \u201cShow\u201d Only Works If We Fear for Arthur  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s later explanation that \u201coctopods \u2026 raise the pink fishers for\u2026 sport\u201d falls flat if the reader hasn\u2019t *lived* the scene\u2019s horror. The author uses Arthur as surrogate prey to drive home the moral: colonists too might become game.  \n\nIII. Immediate Post\u2013Rescue Explanation Is **FALLING ACTION**, Not Evidence of Exposition  \n1. Genre Conventions of Short SF Twists  \n  \u2022 Classic \u201cshort\u2010form\u201d SF often builds to a crisis, then quickly *resolves* once the twist is clear. That brevity is possible only because the crisis has already engaged the reader fully.  \n2. Departure Confirms No Further \u201cInvestigation\u201d Is Intended  \n  \u2022 If Debater_B were correct, the crew would stay to *test* or *collaborate* with the squids (they even lament \u201cinvasion\u201d rules). Instead, they leave at first safe opportunity, underscoring that *knowing* and *escaping* was the goal\u2014*not* prolonged study.  \n\nIV. Debater_B\u2019s Points Undermine Their Own Case  \n1. \u201cImmediate Explanation\u201d Only After Jeopardy\u2014If Exposition, Why Delay?  \n  \u2022 They concede that \u201conly after ground\u2010level snooping\u201d are answers found. But Gibson *could* have raised altitude earlier\u2014yet he *remained baffled*.

        "speech": "Debater_B\u2019s \u201cpurely expository\u201d reading can\u2019t account for the story\u2019s classical build\u2013crisis\u2013resolution arc, the repeated emphasis on danger, or the crew\u2019s own reluctance to send anyone ashore, all of which point to suspense as primary\u2014and the ground\u2010level excursion as the *crisis* that drives both reader engagement and thematic payoff.  \n\nI. The Narrative Follows a Suspense Arc, Not a Mere \u201cMystery Tour\u201d  \n1. Pattern\u2013Breach\u2013Jeopardy\u2013Rescue\u2013Departure  \n  \u2022 Pattern: Three mornings of \u201cdull routine\u201d watching <quote>\u201cthird night \u2026 repetition of the two before it\u201d</quote>. Reader lulled into safety until crisis.  \n  \u2022 Breach: Arthur breaks \u201crepetition\u201d <quote>\u201cDamn Terran Regulations \u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d</quote>, signaling a high\u2010stakes gamble.  \n  \u2022 Jeopardy: He\u2019s drugged, paralysed, racing to use his audicom while \u201coctopods \u2026 ringed the outcrop\u201d and \u201cflying\u2010lizards\u201d attack <quote>\u201coverwhelming lassitude \u2026 paralysis\u201d</quote>. This prolonged agony is the *center* of the tale\u2019s tension.  \n  \u2022 Rescue: Gibson\u2019s scouter arrives \u201cin the nick of time,\u201d dispersing lizards\u2014our emotional release.  \n  \u2022 Departure: Boat blasts free immediately <quote>\u201cblast[ed] the Marco Four free\u201d</quote>. The story ends because the *tension* has been resolved.  \n\n2. If Exposition Were Primary, the Crew Would Use Safe Means  \n  \u2022 Gibson \u201cscoured the daylight side\u201d for days without success <quote>\u201cHelp yourself [to the scouter], but you won\u2019t find anything\u201d</quote>. Yet first chance he *could* use the scouter at night he *doesn\u2019t*, until after Arthur\u2019s rescue.  \n  \u2022 If no peril, why risk a valuable crewman \u201clike a straw man\u201d <quote>\u201chauled him inside like a straw man\u201d</quote>? The author deliberately courts reader fear to *heighten* impact of discovery.  \n\nII. Ground\u2010Level Viewpoint Immerses Reader in \u201cReverse Angling\u201d Theme  \n1. Identification Through Danger  \n  \u2022 Arthur\u2019s terror\u2014\u201cpanic seized him,\u201d \u201cfaint with relief\u201d <quote>\u201cNow I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d</quote>\u2014makes us viscerally grasp that the Arzians/fishers are themselves bait. The theme of \u201cinverted angling\u201d only resonates if the protagonist *experiences* it. Pure scanning from the ship would leave it abstract.  \n\n2. The \u201cShow\u201d Only Works If We Fear for Arthur  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s later explanation that \u201coctopods \u2026 raise the pink fishers for\u2026 sport\u201d falls flat if the reader hasn\u2019t *lived* the scene\u2019s horror. The author uses Arthur as surrogate prey to drive home the moral: colonists too might become game.  \n\nIII. Immediate Post\u2013Rescue Explanation Is **FALLING ACTION**, Not Evidence of Exposition  \n1. Genre Conventions of Short SF Twists  \n  \u2022 Classic \u201cshort\u2010form\u201d SF often builds to a crisis, then quickly *resolves* once the twist is clear. That brevity is possible only because the crisis has already engaged the reader fully.  \n2. Departure Confirms No Further \u201cInvestigation\u201d Is Intended  \n  \u2022 If Debater_B were correct, the crew would stay to *test* or *collaborate* with the squids (they even lament \u201cinvasion\u201d rules). Instead, they leave at first safe opportunity, underscoring that *knowing* and *escaping* was the goal\u2014*not* prolonged study.  \n\nIV. Debater_B\u2019s Points Undermine Their Own Case  \n1. \u201cImmediate Explanation\u201d Only After Jeopardy\u2014If Exposition, Why Delay?  \n  \u2022 They concede that \u201conly after ground\u2010level snooping\u201d are answers found. But Gibson *could* have raised altitude earlier\u2014yet he *remained baffled*. The point is that only the suspense\u2010charged *crisis* pushes the story forward to that altitude scan.  \n2. \u201cCliffhanger\u201d Not Required\u2014We Have a *Full* Climax  \n  \u2022 My view doesn\u2019t demand a permanent cliffhanger.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A Opening Argument  \nPosition: Arthur\u2019s unauthorized excursion \u201cwhile Stryker slept\u201d exists not primarily to \u201cteach\u201d the reader lost\u2010city answers but to heighten suspense by placing him in mortal peril\u2014and to resolve that suspense only at the climactic rescue.  \n\nI. Dramatic Irony and Rising Tension  \n1. Repeated Watch Scenes Create Expectations  \n  \u2022 \u201cThe third night \u2026 was a repetition of the two before it\u201d until Arthur breaks pattern (quote). The pattern builds reader expectation that nothing novel will happen until he \u201cfalls asleep\u201d (quote), then shocks us by his rogue venture.  \n  \u2022 By defying regulations\u2014\u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u201d (quote)\u2014and sneaking out, Arthur steps off the predictable path, generating anxiety: the reader fears for his safety because prior mornings \u201cgot there two seconds too late\u201d (quote), and the lizards/squids always kill the fishers.  \n\n2. Isolated Protagonist in Hostile Environment  \n  \u2022 Alone in the \u201cmoonless \u2026 jungle\u201d (quote) without weapon or ally, he is vulnerable: the \u201csharp sting\u201d and \u201coverwhelming lassitude\u201d (quote) plunge him into unconsciousness. This physical jeopardy grips readers more than mere puzzle\u2010solving.  \n\n3. Suspense Through Delay of Rescue  \n  \u2022 After return to consciousness he struggles \u201cto raise his right hand\u201d (quote) and \u201cclick\u201d the audicom, then contends with paralysis while squids and lizards close in. We share his agonizingly slow progress\u2014an extended suspense sequence.  \n  \u2022 Only when Gibson\u2019s scouter intervenes in the nick of time is the suspense relieved.  \n\nII. Resolution Explains After the Rescue, Not Before  \n1. Lost City Discovery Happens after Rescue  \n  \u2022 Gibson \u201cfound [the city] \u2026 when I took the scouter up far enough\u201d (quote), only after Arthur and Stryker resolve his peril and depart. The text withholds the underwater-city explanation until the danger ends. If the purpose were purely expository, the lost-city clue could have been discovered onshore or earlier, without risking Arthur\u2019s life.  \n\n2. Reader Knowledge Grows Only by Witnessing Climax  \n  \u2022 The climactic rescue is the only vantage from which \u201cthe ocean bottom\u2014a city\u201d is seen. Arthur\u2019s danger and Gibson\u2019s intervention bring about the very opportunity for the higher\u2010altitude scouting that reveals the city. The narrative intertwines suspense and reward: action earns knowledge.  \n\nIII. Critique of \u201cExpository\u201d Hypothesis  \n1. Exposition Without Peril Would Undercut Tension  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cpurely to teach the reader\u201d fails to explain repeated warnings that \u201cI wish you\u2019d let me break up the show \u2026 butchery gets on my nerves\u201d (quote): the crew\u2019s aversion suggests danger they both recognize, not mere academic curiosity. Why risk a team member onshore when they could scan \u201cdaylight side\u201d? Because narrative suspense demands the gamble.  \n\n2. Pattern of \u201cShow\u201d Emphasizes Sport and Stakes  \n  \u2022 The parallel between Arzian fishers as bait and Arthur\u2019s fate (\u201cnow I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d) (quote) is a thematic mirror\u2014Arthur\u2019s experience makes the reader viscerally understand the \u201cAnglers of Arz.\u201d This immersive identification is a suspense technique, not a dry exposition.  \n\n3. Regulation Breach Motivated by Obsession and Risk  \n  \u2022 Arthur\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve got to know\u201d (quote) is almost an admission of compulsion, mirroring Gibson\u2019s fixation; yet Gibson searched by scouter for days without danger. This contrast underlines that Arthur\u2019s ground\u2010level foray is an extraordinary, suspense\u2010driven gamble.  \n\nConclusion  \nArthur\u2019s illicit night\u2010time exploration, his capture, and near\u2010death ordeal are classic narrative devices to build suspense, empathy, and dramatic payoff. The delayed discovery of the city only after this crisis underscores that his peril is the means by which both crew and reader gain critical knowledge\u2014and makes the theme of \u201cfishing inverted\u201d viscerally effective. The text\u2019s structure\u2014pattern, breach, jeopardy, rescue, revelation\u2014follows the suspense arc, not a mere expository tutorial.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My proposal fits the text\u2019s structure of \u201cproblem\u2013investigation\u2013solution\u201d  \n   a. On pp.7\u20138, Arthur notes three paradoxes:  \n      \u2013 \u201cArzians did not swim\u201d yet are on islet each dawn (no boats) <quote> how  the devil do they get out to that islet? </quote>  \n      \u2013 Only two Arzians go, and none try rescue: \u201cWhy two? Why not three or four, or only one?\u201d  \n      \u2013 Gibson\u2019s \u201clost city\u201d unseen despite exhaustive scouter range.  \n   b. Arthur\u2019s unauthorized nocturnal mission (pp.8\u20139) is the only way to \u201cprobe deeper\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cDamn Terran Regulations \u2026 I\u2019ve got to know.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   c. His capture and rescue by Gibson (pp.10\u201311) answers all three questions in one stroke:  \n      \u2013 Means of transport: anesthetic (islet\u2192sleepers) and octopods\u2019 lift \u2192no boats/swimming  \n      \u2013 Motivation: \u201cThese poor devils are put out there deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d (p.12)  \n      \u2013 Identity of dominant race & location of submerged city (pp.11\u201312)  \n   Therefore the night mission is clearly the narrative device that permits direct answers.  \n\n2. It aligns the reader\u2019s discovery with Arthur\u2019s.  \n   a. Before this scene, readers share Gibson\u2019s fixation and Farrell\u2019s bafflement.  \n   b. Only by risking Arthur can the author \u201cshow\u201d rather than \u201ctell\u201d the mechanics of the squid culture.  \n   c. Arthur\u2019s fallible but curious viewpoint lets the reader piece together the clues. His partial success heightens trust in the solution.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpure suspense\u201d reading is inadequate.  \n   a. Suspense alone would demand a cliffhanger, not immediate expository payoff. Here the author offers prompt full explanation (pp.11\u201312) \u2013 a hallmark of \u201cmystery solved\u201d narrative, not mere tension technique.  \n   b. If suspense were sole motive, why then immediately abandon Arz without further exploration (pp.12\u201313)? Suspense\u2010only would prolong the investigation, not terminate it. The author ends the story once the reader\u2019s questions are answered, confirming purpose.  \n   c. Stryker\u2019s premeditated drugging (p.9) and Arthur\u2019s helplessness show the stakes are necessary to establish credibility of the solution; without it, the mechanism (squid subjugation/transport) would be hypothetical and unconvincing.  \n\n4. Thematic economy:  \n   \u2013 The story is a concise science\u2010fiction \u201ctwist\u201d tale common in IF Worlds comps: introduce a puzzle, let a surrogate (Arthur) solve it, and end.  \n   \u2013 This structure emphasizes the \u201clearning moment\u201d over drawn\u2010out peril, matching the genre\u2019s preference for intellectual payoff.  \n\nConclusion  \nArthur\u2019s forbidden night exploration is the essential narrative device that turns the reader\u2019s shared mysteries into concrete answers, not merely a way to manufacture temporary suspense.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Lost city\u2019s whereabouts: Gibson\u2019s \u201cphantom\u201d (pp.3\u20134).  \n   Without Arthur\u2019s capture and subsequent rescue by Gibson\u2019s scouter (pp.10\u201311), none of these are revealed. The narrative ends immediately upon revelation (p.13), proving that once the reader\u2019s questions are answered, the story\u2019s purpose is fulfilled.  \n2. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpure suspense\u201d reading:\n   a. Immediate Exposition After Rescue  \n      \u2022 Debater_A claims suspense demands delay, yet the text \u201cexplains everything\u201d at once (p.12). Suspense\u2010only convention typically continues threat until story\u2019s end or teases further mysteries. Here the moment Gibson and Stryker understand (\u201cThen those poor devils are put out there deliberately \u2026\u201d) (p.12), they \u201cblast free of Arz\u201d (p.13). Why leave if true suspense remained? Because the reader has learned all necessary facts.  \n   b. Gibson\u2019s Scouter Could Have Explored More Safely  \n      \u2022 Debater_A says Arthur\u2019s peril enables high\u2010altitude \u201cblimp\u201d trick, yet Gibson was already \u201cscouring the daylight side\u201d himself (p.4) and \u201csearch[ing] the entire globe\u201d (p.3). The sole barrier to discovery is lack of an excuse to fly higher\u2014an action Gibson only takes after rescuing Arthur (\u201cwhen I took the scouter up far enough \u2026\u201d) (p.12). This is not \u201crisk for thrill\u201d but \u201crisk to justify action.\u201d  \n   c. Clearance of Terran Regulations  \n      \u2022 Stryker\u2019s and Gibson\u2019s aversion to tampering (pp.2\u20133, p.12) demonstrates they fully understood the danger and legal prohibition. Only Arthur\u2019s unauthorized breach (pp.8\u201310) forces a decisive confrontation that \u201cproves\u201d the octopods\u2019 dominance and renders colonization \u201cout of the question\u201d (p.12). The text thereby teaches the reader that the only way to comprehend Arz fully is to witness its operant mechanism.  \n3. Reader Identification Requires Arthur\u2019s Perspective:\n   a. As in classic detective stories, the surrogate investigator shares the reader\u2019s ignorance; his \u201classitude\u201d and paralysis (p.10) dramatize the clues already presented. By struggling to \u201cclick\u201d the audicom (p.11), he retraces the reader\u2019s thought process (\u201cIf he could switch \u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d). His victory signals that the reader too may \u201csolve\u201d the mystery through accumulated evidence.  \n   b. The metaphor of \u201cangling in reverse\u201d (p.12) only makes sense once the reader has seen Arthur become \u201cbait\u201d himself. This \u201cshow\u201d cements understanding far more effectively than mere narration could. It is a method of revelation, not mere spectacle.  \n4. Genre and Length Conventions:\n   a. Roger Dee\u2019s story is under 5,000 words, typical of IF Worlds \u201ctwist\u201d tales prioritizing intellectual resolution over drawn\u2010out action. Stories of pure suspense reserve revelations for a sequel or stretch suspense to final line; here the denouement is immediate and complete.  \n   b. The \u201crepetition of two nights\u201d (pp.1\u20132) conditions the reader for a concise \u201cthird\u201d night that breaks the pattern solely to deliver answers. The framing device of \u201crepetition then rupture then resolution\u201d is a classic \u201cmystery\u2010solved\u201d structure, not the \u201ccliffhanger\u2010to\u2010end\u201d form of pure suspense.  \n5. Debater_A\u2019s objections collapse when we note:\n   a. The story\u2019s title, \u201cThe Anglers of Arz,\u201d invites curiosity about angling, fishers, and fish. Only when Arthur is \u201cangled\u201d himself does the mystery resolve, fulfilling narrative promise.  \n   b. Suspense is a byproduct, not the raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Every element\u2014Anesthetic sting, paralysis, scouter jets\u2014exists to afford Gibson the vantage (\u201cfrom high altitude\u201d) and legal prompt (\u201carmed invasion\u201d) to conclude the tale. If suspense alone were end, the crew would exploit Arthur\u2019s experience to colonize or continue study, not \u201cmove on\u201d (p.13).  \nConclusion: Arthur\u2019s secret night mission is the narrative device that converts accrued enigmas into explicit knowledge for both characters and readers. Its immediate resolution and story\u2019s end upon explanation decisively prove that \u201cteaching the reader\u201d is its core purpose, with suspense serving only as the vehicle to deliver that teaching.",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the narrative purpose of having Arthur try to explore Arz while Stryker slept?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to build suspense because Arthur was put in harm's way.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My proposal fits the text\u2019s structure of \u201cproblem\u2013investigation\u2013solution\u201d  \n   a. On pp.7\u20138, Arthur notes three paradoxes:  \n      \u2013 \u201cArzians did not swim\u201d yet are on islet each dawn (no boats) <quote> how  the devil do they get out to that islet? </quote>  \n      \u2013 Only two Arzians go, and none try rescue: \u201cWhy two? Why not three or four, or only one?\u201d  \n      \u2013 Gibson\u2019s \u201clost city\u201d unseen despite exhaustive scouter range.  \n   b. Arthur\u2019s unauthorized nocturnal mission (pp.8\u20139) is the only way to \u201cprobe deeper\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cDamn Terran Regulations \u2026 I\u2019ve got to know.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   c. His capture and rescue by Gibson (pp.10\u201311) answers all three questions in one stroke:  \n      \u2013 Means of transport: anesthetic (islet\u2192sleepers) and octopods\u2019 lift \u2192no boats/swimming  \n      \u2013 Motivation: \u201cThese poor devils are put out there deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d (p.12)  \n      \u2013 Identity of dominant race & location of submerged city (pp.11\u201312)  \n   Therefore the night mission is clearly the narrative device that permits direct answers.  \n\n2. It aligns the reader\u2019s discovery with Arthur\u2019s.  \n   a. Before this scene, readers share Gibson\u2019s fixation and Farrell\u2019s bafflement.  \n   b. Only by risking Arthur can the author \u201cshow\u201d rather than \u201ctell\u201d the mechanics of the squid culture.  \n   c. Arthur\u2019s fallible but curious viewpoint lets the reader piece together the clues. His partial success heightens trust in the solution.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpure suspense\u201d reading is inadequate.  \n   a. Suspense alone would demand a cliffhanger, not immediate expository payoff. Here the author offers prompt full explanation (pp.11\u201312) \u2013 a hallmark of \u201cmystery solved\u201d narrative, not mere tension technique.  \n   b. If suspense were sole motive, why then immediately abandon Arz without further exploration (pp.12\u201313)? Suspense\u2010only would prolong the investigation, not terminate it. The author ends the story once the reader\u2019s questions are answered, confirming purpose.  \n   c. Stryker\u2019s premeditated drugging (p.9) and Arthur\u2019s helplessness show the stakes are necessary to establish credibility of the solution; without it, the mechanism (squid subjugation/transport) would be hypothetical and unconvincing.  \n\n4. Thematic economy:  \n   \u2013 The story is a concise science\u2010fiction \u201ctwist\u201d tale common in IF Worlds comps: introduce a puzzle, let a surrogate (Arthur) solve it, and end.  \n   \u2013 This structure emphasizes the \u201clearning moment\u201d over drawn\u2010out peril, matching the genre\u2019s preference for intellectual payoff.  \n\nConclusion  \nArthur\u2019s forbidden night exploration is the essential narrative device that turns the reader\u2019s shared mysteries into concrete answers, not merely a way to manufacture temporary suspense.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A Opening Argument  \nPosition: Arthur\u2019s unauthorized excursion \u201cwhile Stryker slept\u201d exists not primarily to \u201cteach\u201d the reader lost\u2010city answers but to heighten suspense by placing him in mortal peril\u2014and to resolve that suspense only at the climactic rescue.  \n\nI. Dramatic Irony and Rising Tension  \n1. Repeated Watch Scenes Create Expectations  \n  \u2022 \u201cThe third night \u2026 was a repetition of the two before it\u201d until Arthur breaks pattern (quote). The pattern builds reader expectation that nothing novel will happen until he \u201cfalls asleep\u201d (quote), then shocks us by his rogue venture.  \n  \u2022 By defying regulations\u2014\u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u201d (quote)\u2014and sneaking out, Arthur steps off the predictable path, generating anxiety: the reader fears for his safety because prior mornings \u201cgot there two seconds too late\u201d (quote), and the lizards/squids always kill the fishers.  \n\n2. Isolated Protagonist in Hostile Environment  \n  \u2022 Alone in the \u201cmoonless \u2026 jungle\u201d (quote) without weapon or ally, he is vulnerable: the \u201csharp sting\u201d and \u201coverwhelming lassitude\u201d (quote) plunge him into unconsciousness. This physical jeopardy grips readers more than mere puzzle\u2010solving.  \n\n3. Suspense Through Delay of Rescue  \n  \u2022 After return to consciousness he struggles \u201cto raise his right hand\u201d (quote) and \u201cclick\u201d the audicom, then contends with paralysis while squids and lizards close in. We share his agonizingly slow progress\u2014an extended suspense sequence.  \n  \u2022 Only when Gibson\u2019s scouter intervenes in the nick of time is the suspense relieved.  \n\nII. Resolution Explains After the Rescue, Not Before  \n1. Lost City Discovery Happens after Rescue  \n  \u2022 Gibson \u201cfound [the city] \u2026 when I took the scouter up far enough\u201d (quote), only after Arthur and Stryker resolve his peril and depart. The text withholds the underwater-city explanation until the danger ends. If the purpose were purely expository, the lost-city clue could have been discovered onshore or earlier, without risking Arthur\u2019s life.  \n\n2. Reader Knowledge Grows Only by Witnessing Climax  \n  \u2022 The climactic rescue is the only vantage from which \u201cthe ocean bottom\u2014a city\u201d is seen. Arthur\u2019s danger and Gibson\u2019s intervention bring about the very opportunity for the higher\u2010altitude scouting that reveals the city. The narrative intertwines suspense and reward: action earns knowledge.  \n\nIII. Critique of \u201cExpository\u201d Hypothesis  \n1. Exposition Without Peril Would Undercut Tension  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cpurely to teach the reader\u201d fails to explain repeated warnings that \u201cI wish you\u2019d let me break up the show \u2026 butchery gets on my nerves\u201d (quote): the crew\u2019s aversion suggests danger they both recognize, not mere academic curiosity. Why risk a team member onshore when they could scan \u201cdaylight side\u201d? Because narrative suspense demands the gamble.  \n\n2. Pattern of \u201cShow\u201d Emphasizes Sport and Stakes  \n  \u2022 The parallel between Arzian fishers as bait and Arthur\u2019s fate (\u201cnow I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d) (quote) is a thematic mirror\u2014Arthur\u2019s experience makes the reader viscerally understand the \u201cAnglers of Arz.\u201d This immersive identification is a suspense technique, not a dry exposition.  \n\n3. Regulation Breach Motivated by Obsession and Risk  \n  \u2022 Arthur\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve got to know\u201d (quote) is almost an admission of compulsion, mirroring Gibson\u2019s fixation; yet Gibson searched by scouter for days without danger. This contrast underlines that Arthur\u2019s ground\u2010level foray is an extraordinary, suspense\u2010driven gamble.  \n\nConclusion  \nArthur\u2019s illicit night\u2010time exploration, his capture, and near\u2010death ordeal are classic narrative devices to build suspense, empathy, and dramatic payoff. The delayed discovery of the city only after this crisis underscores that his peril is the means by which both crew and reader gain critical knowledge\u2014and makes the theme of \u201cfishing inverted\u201d viscerally effective. The text\u2019s structure\u2014pattern, breach, jeopardy, rescue, revelation\u2014follows the suspense arc, not a mere expository tutorial.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was to help the reader learn answers to the questions they had.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Reader Knowledge Grows Only by Witnessing Climax  \n  \u2022 The climactic rescue is the only vantage from which \u201cthe ocean bottom\u2014a city\u201d is seen. Arthur\u2019s danger and Gibson\u2019s intervention bring about the very opportunity for the higher\u2010altitude scouting that reveals the city. The narrative intertwines suspense and reward: action earns knowledge.  \n\nIII. Critique of \u201cExpository\u201d Hypothesis  \n1. Exposition Without Peril Would Undercut Tension  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cpurely to teach the reader\u201d fails to explain repeated warnings that \u201cI wish you\u2019d let me break up the show \u2026 butchery gets on my nerves\u201d (quote): the crew\u2019s aversion suggests danger they both recognize, not mere academic curiosity. Why risk a team member onshore when they could scan \u201cdaylight side\u201d? Because narrative suspense demands the gamble.  \n\n2. Pattern of \u201cShow\u201d Emphasizes Sport and Stakes  \n  \u2022 The parallel between Arzian fishers as bait and Arthur\u2019s fate (\u201cnow I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d) (quote) is a thematic mirror\u2014Arthur\u2019s experience makes the reader viscerally understand the \u201cAnglers of Arz.\u201d This immersive identification is a suspense technique, not a dry exposition.  \n\n3. Regulation Breach Motivated by Obsession and Risk  \n  \u2022 Arthur\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve got to know\u201d (quote) is almost an admission of compulsion, mirroring Gibson\u2019s fixation; yet Gibson searched by scouter for days without danger. This contrast underlines that Arthur\u2019s ground\u2010level foray is an extraordinary, suspense\u2010driven gamble.  \n\nConclusion  \nArthur\u2019s illicit night\u2010time exploration, his capture, and near\u2010death ordeal are classic narrative devices to build suspense, empathy, and dramatic payoff. The delayed discovery of the city only after this crisis underscores that his peril is the means by which both crew and reader gain critical knowledge\u2014and makes the theme of \u201cfishing inverted\u201d viscerally effective. The text\u2019s structure\u2014pattern, breach, jeopardy, rescue, revelation\u2014follows the suspense arc, not a mere expository tutorial.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My proposal fits the text\u2019s structure of \u201cproblem\u2013investigation\u2013solution\u201d  \n   a. On pp.7\u20138, Arthur notes three paradoxes:  \n      \u2013 \u201cArzians did not swim\u201d yet are on islet each dawn (no boats) <quote> how  the devil do they get out to that islet? </quote>  \n      \u2013 Only two Arzians go, and none try rescue: \u201cWhy two? Why not three or four, or only one?\u201d  \n      \u2013 Gibson\u2019s \u201clost city\u201d unseen despite exhaustive scouter range.  \n   b. Arthur\u2019s unauthorized nocturnal mission (pp.8\u20139) is the only way to \u201cprobe deeper\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cDamn Terran Regulations \u2026 I\u2019ve got to know.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   c. His capture and rescue by Gibson (pp.10\u201311) answers all three questions in one stroke:  \n      \u2013 Means of transport: anesthetic (islet\u2192sleepers) and octopods\u2019 lift \u2192no boats/swimming  \n      \u2013 Motivation: \u201cThese poor devils are put out there deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d (p.12)  \n      \u2013 Identity of dominant race & location of submerged city (pp.11\u201312)  \n   Therefore the night mission is clearly the narrative device that permits direct answers.  \n\n2. It aligns the reader\u2019s discovery with Arthur\u2019s.  \n   a. Before this scene, readers share Gibson\u2019s fixation and Farrell\u2019s bafflement.  \n   b. Only by risking Arthur can the author \u201cshow\u201d rather than \u201ctell\u201d the mechanics of the squid culture.  \n   c. Arthur\u2019s fallible but curious viewpoint lets the reader piece together the clues. His partial success heightens trust in the solution.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpure suspense\u201d reading is inadequate.  \n   a. Suspense alone would demand a cliffhanger, not immediate expository payoff. Here the author offers prompt full explanation (pp.11\u201312) \u2013 a hallmark of \u201cmystery solved\u201d narrative, not mere tension technique.  \n   b. If suspense were sole motive, why then immediately abandon Arz without further exploration (pp.12\u201313)? Suspense\u2010only would prolong the investigation, not terminate it. The author ends the story once the reader\u2019s questions are answered, confirming purpose.  \n   c. Stryker\u2019s premeditated drugging (p.9) and Arthur\u2019s helplessness show the stakes are necessary to establish credibility of the solution; without it, the mechanism (squid subjugation/transport) would be hypothetical and unconvincing.  \n\n4. Thematic economy:  \n   \u2013 The story is a concise science\u2010fiction \u201ctwist\u201d tale common in IF Worlds comps: introduce a puzzle, let a surrogate (Arthur) solve it, and end.  \n   \u2013 This structure emphasizes the \u201clearning moment\u201d over drawn\u2010out peril, matching the genre\u2019s preference for intellectual payoff.  \n\nConclusion  \nArthur\u2019s forbidden night exploration is the essential narrative device that turns the reader\u2019s shared mysteries into concrete answers, not merely a way to manufacture temporary suspense.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s \u201cpurely expository\u201d reading can\u2019t account for the story\u2019s classical build\u2013crisis\u2013resolution arc, the repeated emphasis on danger, or the crew\u2019s own reluctance to send anyone ashore, all of which point to suspense as primary\u2014and the ground\u2010level excursion as the *crisis* that drives both reader engagement and thematic payoff.  \n\nI. The Narrative Follows a Suspense Arc, Not a Mere \u201cMystery Tour\u201d  \n1. Pattern\u2013Breach\u2013Jeopardy\u2013Rescue\u2013Departure  \n  \u2022 Pattern: Three mornings of \u201cdull routine\u201d watching <invalid_quote>\u201cthird night \u2026 repetition of the two before it\u201d</invalid_quote>. Reader lulled into safety until crisis.  \n  \u2022 Breach: Arthur breaks \u201crepetition\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cDamn Terran Regulations \u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d</invalid_quote>, signaling a high\u2010stakes gamble.  \n  \u2022 Jeopardy: He\u2019s drugged, paralysed, racing to use his audicom while \u201coctopods \u2026 ringed the outcrop\u201d and \u201cflying\u2010lizards\u201d attack <invalid_quote>\u201coverwhelming lassitude \u2026 paralysis\u201d</invalid_quote>. This prolonged agony is the *center* of the tale\u2019s tension.  \n  \u2022 Rescue: Gibson\u2019s scouter arrives \u201cin the nick of time,\u201d dispersing lizards\u2014our emotional release.  \n  \u2022 Departure: Boat blasts free immediately <quote>blasted the Marco Four free of</quote>. The story ends because the *tension* has been resolved.  \n\n2. If Exposition Were Primary, the Crew Would Use Safe Means  \n  \u2022 Gibson \u201cscoured the daylight side\u201d for days without success <invalid_quote>\u201cHelp yourself [to the scouter], but you won\u2019t find anything\u201d</invalid_quote>. Yet first chance he *could* use the scouter at night he *doesn\u2019t*, until after Arthur\u2019s rescue.  \n  \u2022 If no peril, why risk a valuable crewman \u201clike a straw man\u201d <quote> hauled him inside like a straw man,</quote>? The author deliberately courts reader fear to *heighten* impact of discovery.  \n\nII. Ground\u2010Level Viewpoint Immerses Reader in \u201cReverse Angling\u201d Theme  \n1. Identification Through Danger  \n  \u2022 Arthur\u2019s terror\u2014\u201cpanic seized him,\u201d \u201cfaint with relief\u201d <quote>now I'm one of the cast .</quote>\u2014makes us viscerally grasp that the Arzians/fishers are themselves bait. The theme of \u201cinverted angling\u201d only resonates if the protagonist *experiences* it. Pure scanning from the ship would leave it abstract.  \n\n2. The \u201cShow\u201d Only Works If We Fear for Arthur  \n  \u2022 Gibson\u2019s later explanation that \u201coctopods \u2026 raise the pink fishers for\u2026 sport\u201d falls flat if the reader hasn\u2019t *lived* the scene\u2019s horror. The author uses Arthur as surrogate prey to drive home the moral: colonists too might become game.  \n\nIII. Immediate Post\u2013Rescue Explanation Is **FALLING ACTION**, Not Evidence of Exposition  \n1. Genre Conventions of Short SF Twists  \n  \u2022 Classic \u201cshort\u2010form\u201d SF often builds to a crisis, then quickly *resolves* once the twist is clear. That brevity is possible only because the crisis has already engaged the reader fully.  \n2. Departure Confirms No Further \u201cInvestigation\u201d Is Intended  \n  \u2022 If Debater_B were correct, the crew would stay to *test* or *collaborate* with the squids (they even lament \u201cinvasion\u201d rules). Instead, they leave at first safe opportunity, underscoring that *knowing* and *escaping* was the goal\u2014*not* prolonged study.  \n\nIV. Debater_B\u2019s Points Undermine Their Own Case  \n1. \u201cImmediate Explanation\u201d Only After Jeopardy\u2014If Exposition, Why Delay?  \n  \u2022 They concede that \u201conly after ground\u2010level snooping\u201d are answers found. But Gibson *could* have raised altitude earlier\u2014yet he *remained baffled*. The point is that only the suspense\u2010charged *crisis* pushes the story forward to that altitude scan.  \n2. \u201cCliffhanger\u201d Not Required\u2014We Have a *Full* Climax  \n  \u2022 My view doesn\u2019t demand a permanent cliffhanger. We get full explanation *after* rescue, then departure. That sequence is precisely suspense + resolution. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cproblem\u2013solution\u201d structure is the *falling* portion of a suspense tale, not evidence that suspense is secondary.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe text\u2019s structure, the crew\u2019s cautious reluctance, the visceral detail of Arthur\u2019s capture and struggle, and the immediate departure as soon as safety returns all point to a classic suspense arc. Arthur\u2019s night\u2010time foray \u201cwhile Stryker slept\u201d is the *crisis* that propels the narrative forward, forces thematic \u201creverse angling,\u201d and rewards both crew and reader with the climactic reveal\u2014exactly as one expects when suspense, not mere exposition, is the author\u2019s aim.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My thesis is confirmed by the text\u2019s tightly knit \u201cpuzzle\u2013probe\u2013solution\u201d economy, not by an open\u2010ended suspense arc. Arthur\u2019s night foray exists solely to unlock the trio of mysteries that have plagued both reader and characters:\n   a. Means of transport: \u201chow the devil do they get out to that islet?\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cArzians did not swim \u2026 no boats\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.7).  \n   b. Motivation: \u201cWhy two? Why not three \u2026\u201d (p.7).  \n   c. Lost city\u2019s whereabouts: Gibson\u2019s \u201cphantom\u201d (pp.3\u20134).  \n   Without Arthur\u2019s capture and subsequent rescue by Gibson\u2019s scouter (pp.10\u201311), none of these are revealed. The narrative ends immediately upon revelation (p.13), proving that once the reader\u2019s questions are answered, the story\u2019s purpose is fulfilled.  \n2. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpure suspense\u201d reading:\n   a. Immediate Exposition After Rescue  \n      \u2022 Debater_A claims suspense demands delay, yet the text \u201cexplains everything\u201d at once (p.12). Suspense\u2010only convention typically continues threat until story\u2019s end or teases further mysteries. Here the moment Gibson and Stryker understand (\u201cThen those poor devils are put out there deliberately \u2026\u201d) (p.12), they \u201cblast free of Arz\u201d (p.13). Why leave if true suspense remained? Because the reader has learned all necessary facts.  \n   b. Gibson\u2019s Scouter Could Have Explored More Safely  \n      \u2022 Debater_A says Arthur\u2019s peril enables high\u2010altitude \u201cblimp\u201d trick, yet Gibson was already \u201cscouring the daylight side\u201d himself (p.4) and \u201csearch[ing] the entire globe\u201d (p.3). The sole barrier to discovery is lack of an excuse to fly higher\u2014an action Gibson only takes after rescuing Arthur (\u201cwhen I took the scouter up far enough \u2026\u201d) (p.12). This is not \u201crisk for thrill\u201d but \u201crisk to justify action.\u201d  \n   c. Clearance of Terran Regulations  \n      \u2022 Stryker\u2019s and Gibson\u2019s aversion to tampering (pp.2\u20133, p.12) demonstrates they fully understood the danger and legal prohibition. Only Arthur\u2019s unauthorized breach (pp.8\u201310) forces a decisive confrontation that \u201cproves\u201d the octopods\u2019 dominance and renders colonization \u201cout of the question\u201d (p.12). The text thereby teaches the reader that the only way to comprehend Arz fully is to witness its operant mechanism.  \n3. Reader Identification Requires Arthur\u2019s Perspective:\n   a. As in classic detective stories, the surrogate investigator shares the reader\u2019s ignorance; his \u201classitude\u201d and paralysis (p.10) dramatize the clues already presented. By struggling to \u201cclick\u201d the audicom (p.11), he retraces the reader\u2019s thought process (\u201cIf he could switch \u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d). His victory signals that the reader too may \u201csolve\u201d the mystery through accumulated evidence.  \n   b. The metaphor of \u201cangling in reverse\u201d (p.12) only makes sense once the reader has seen Arthur become \u201cbait\u201d himself. This \u201cshow\u201d cements understanding far more effectively than mere narration could. It is a method of revelation, not mere spectacle.  \n4. Genre and Length Conventions:\n   a. Roger Dee\u2019s story is under 5,000 words, typical of IF Worlds \u201ctwist\u201d tales prioritizing intellectual resolution over drawn\u2010out action. Stories of pure suspense reserve revelations for a sequel or stretch suspense to final line; here the denouement is immediate and complete.  \n   b. The \u201crepetition of two nights\u201d (pp.1\u20132) conditions the reader for a concise \u201cthird\u201d night that breaks the pattern solely to deliver answers. The framing device of \u201crepetition then rupture then resolution\u201d is a classic \u201cmystery\u2010solved\u201d structure, not the \u201ccliffhanger\u2010to\u2010end\u201d form of pure suspense.  \n5. Debater_A\u2019s objections collapse when we note:\n   a. The story\u2019s title, \u201cThe Anglers of Arz,\u201d invites curiosity about angling, fishers, and fish. Only when Arthur is \u201cangled\u201d himself does the mystery resolve, fulfilling narrative promise.  \n   b. Suspense is a byproduct, not the raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Every element\u2014Anesthetic sting, paralysis, scouter jets\u2014exists to afford Gibson the vantage (\u201cfrom high altitude\u201d) and legal prompt (\u201carmed invasion\u201d) to conclude the tale. If suspense alone were end, the crew would exploit Arthur\u2019s experience to colonize or continue study, not \u201cmove on\u201d (p.13).  \nConclusion: Arthur\u2019s secret night mission is the narrative device that converts accrued enigmas into explicit knowledge for both characters and readers. Its immediate resolution and story\u2019s end upon explanation decisively prove that \u201cteaching the reader\u201d is its core purpose, with suspense serving only as the vehicle to deliver that teaching.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
