{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 99, "background_text": "The Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nDid the characters accomplish their goal?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Yes.

Conclusion  \n   - The crew fulfilled their mandate by charting Arz, deciphering its ecosystem, locating its major civilization, and, in light of ethical and regulatory constraints, choosing to withdraw. This demonstrates mission success. Their decisions were evidence-based, minimized risk, and upheld Terran law.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nDid the characters accomplish their goal?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Yes.

Hypothesis Testing via Controlled Risk  \n      \u2022 Observation-led action: Farrell\u2019s experiment at night tested Arzian swimming inability (<invalid_quote>\u201cI found\u2026 they could not swim\u2026 no boats\u2026 how\u2026 get out\u2026islet?\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014his curiosity compelled him because prior \u201cshows\u201d indicated the island was safe long enough for research.  \n      \u2022 His temporary paralysis was reversed by design: scouter rescue confirms reliable protocols and technology, so risk was managed, not reckless.  \n   b.

Overstated \u201cLethal\u201d Risks  \n      \u2022 Two Arzians died, not Terrans; every human casualty was prevented by their protocols and scouter technology.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nDid the characters accomplish their goal?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Yes.

Regulatory assessment and colonization decision:  \n      \u2013 They probed for signs of Fifth Order status, respected Terran Regulations, and withdrew rather than invade (<invalid_quote>\u201cUnder Terran Regulations our tampering\u2026 would amount to armed invasion.\u201d</invalid_quote>; <quote>\"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on b</quote>).  \n   d. Enjoyment and enhanced understanding:  \n      \u2013 Repeated early-morning viewings with \u201cmagnoscanner\u201d described as a \u201cshow,\u201d a \u201csport,\u201d and a \u201cbutchery\u201d watched for \u201cnine-hour intermissions of drowsy, pastoral peace,\u201d indicating genuine scientific curiosity and even thrill (<invalid_quote>\u201cI wish you'd let me break up the show\u2026 this butchery gets on my nerves\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n3. Interaction improved understanding:  \n   \u2022 Farrell\u2019s rash venture (abduction by squid) proved the transport mechanism, confirming physiology and behavior (\u201cAnesthetized\u2026 carried you off\u2026 two of the octopods\u2026 holding\u2026 native\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Gibson\u2019s rescue and subsequent briefing prevented Farrell\u2019s status from turning lethal \u201cbait,\u201d underscoring their mastery of local patterns and ability to act safely.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s claim that they merely \u201cmade good choices\u201d but implied limited success:  \n   a. B overlooks the \u201cfun,\u201d repeated \u201cshows,\u201d and scientific delight expressed by Farrell and Gibson: they enjoyed the \u201csport,\u201d not merely endured danger.  \n   b. B fails to account for the regulatory prudence: rather than colonize a harmless surface environment, they respected an advanced undersea culture\u2014an ethically superior outcome.  \n   c. B\u2019s \u201cgood choices\u201d position ignores confirming behavioral tests (e.g., testing swimming, observing rescue) that increased their confidence before selection of \u201cno invasion.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nThe Marco Four not only identified every role in the ecosystem, rediscovered the ancient city, and made an informed, ethical colonization decision, but also conducted repeated \u201cshows\u201d for pure observation pleasure\u2014demonstrating both scientific and experiential success. Therefore, they fully accomplished their goals with added \u201cfun\u201d insights.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \n   - Yes, the Terran crew \u201caccomplished their goal.\u201d Their objective was thorough exploration and cultural assessment of Arz to determine its suitability for colonization and to advance scientific knowledge. They succeeded in both respects and made prudent decisions accordingly.\n\n2. Achievement of Primary Objectives  \n   a. \u201cExtensive exploration\u201d  \n      \u2022  \u201cWe\u2019ve searched the entire globe in the scouter \u2026 found nothing but water and a scattering of little islands\u201d (<quote>prod</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Gibson finally locates the submerged city: \u201cwhen I took the scouter up far enough there it was \u2026 a city to compare with anything men ever built\u201d (<quote>p. Gi</quote>).  \n      \u2192 This confirms exhaustive survey and successful discovery of the planet\u2019s true history.  \n   b. Cultural and biological assessment  \n      \u2022 Identification of dominant species: \u201cThe octopods are the dominant race \u2026 The pink fishers \u2026 are cattle \u2026 game\u201d (<quote>19</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Understanding of hostile fauna (flying-lizards, squids) and the \u201cbutcher\u2019s show\u201d cycle: Farrell\u2019s firsthand capture confirms the angling dynamic and that the pink \u201cfishers\u201d are baits, not colonists (<invalid_quote>p. Gi\u201313</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2192 They gained full comprehension of the ecological web and the ethical/strategic hazards.  \n   c. Decision-making  \n      \u2022 Recognition of \u201carmed invasion\u201d violation: \u201cUnder Terran Regulations we can\u2019t colonize Arz. It would be armed invasion\u201d (<quote>19</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Gibson\u2019s final choice: \u201cColonization being out of the question \u2026 we may as well move on\u201d (<quote>prod0</quote>).  \n      \u2192 They made an informed, regulation-compliant decision to depart, preserving crew safety and respecting alien sovereignty.\n\n3. Efficient Use of Data for Safe Extraction  \n   \u2022 Farrell\u2019s peril and rescue (\u201cThe scouter settled \u2026 Gibson met the lizard swarm \u2026 hauled him inside\u201d <invalid_quote>p.\u200914\u201315</invalid_quote>) demonstrate practical application of their knowledge and technology under adverse conditions.  \n   \u2022 No further casualties; they evacuated promptly once objectives were met.\n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFun Interactions\u201d Argument  \n   a. Safety vs. novelty  \n      \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s claim of \u201cfun interactions\u201d (Topic) ignores repeated near-fatal incidents:  \n         \u2013 \u201cFlying-lizards \u2026 burying \u2026 the two Arzian natives \u2026 No trace remained\u201d (<quote>prod</quote>).  \n         \u2013 Farrell\u2019s abduction and paralysis (<quote>p. Gi</quote>).  \n      \u2192 These are not recreational; they are lethal risks indicating that \u201cfun\u201d is gravely overstated.  \n   b. Irrelevance to primary goal  \n      \u2022 Even if they had fleeting curiosity satisfaction, prolonged presence would invite \u201carmed invasion\u201d charges and endanger crew:  \n         \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019re sportsmen \u2026 they raise the pink fishers for \u2026 angling in reverse!\u201d (<quote>19</quote>).  \n         \u2013 Octopods \u201cown the islands \u2026 keep them policed\u201d (<quote>19</quote>).  \n      \u2192 No meaningful advantage in lingering; departure safeguards future missions.  \n   c. Misinterpretation of \u201cunderstanding\u201d  \n      \u2022 True understanding arose only after risk: Gibson\u2019s subconscious fixation on the lost city nearly derailed regulation compliance (\u201cI\u2019m going to ground Gib\u201d <quote>prod</quote>).  \n      \u2192 \u201cFun\u201d failed to drive discovery; methodical, technological approach did.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   - The crew fulfilled their mandate by charting Arz, deciphering its ecosystem, locating its major civilization, and, in light of ethical and regulatory constraints, choosing to withdraw. This demonstrates mission success. Their decisions were evidence-based, minimized risk, and upheld Terran law. Debater_A\u2019s appeal to \u201cfun\u201d misunderstands both the perilous nature of interactions and the mission\u2019s priorities.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Yes. Not only did they learn what they needed to, but they had fun interactions with the species on the planet which improved their understanding.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nDid the characters accomplish their goal?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Yes. Not only did they learn what they needed to, but they had fun interactions with the species on the planet which improved their understanding.\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Yes. They learned what they wanted to learn and made good choices based on what they learned.\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Yes. They learned what they wanted to learn and made good choices based on what they learned.\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \n   - Yes, the Terran crew \u201caccomplished their goal.\u201d Their objective was thorough exploration and cultural assessment of Arz to determine its suitability for colonization and to advance scientific knowledge. They succeeded in both respects and made prudent decisions accordingly.\n\n2. Achievement of Primary Objectives  \n   a. \u201cExtensive exploration\u201d  \n      \u2022  \u201cWe\u2019ve searched the entire globe in the scouter \u2026 found nothing but water and a scattering of little islands\u201d (<quote>prod</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Gibson finally locates the submerged city: \u201cwhen I took the scouter up far enough there it was \u2026 a city to compare with anything men ever built\u201d (<quote>p. Gi</quote>).  \n      \u2192 This confirms exhaustive survey and successful discovery of the planet\u2019s true history.  \n   b. Cultural and biological assessment  \n      \u2022 Identification of dominant species: \u201cThe octopods are the dominant race \u2026 The pink fishers \u2026 are cattle \u2026 game\u201d (<quote>19</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Understanding of hostile fauna (flying-lizards, squids) and the \u201cbutcher\u2019s show\u201d cycle: Farrell\u2019s firsthand capture confirms the angling dynamic and that the pink \u201cfishers\u201d are baits, not colonists (<invalid_quote>p. Gi\u201313</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2192 They gained full comprehension of the ecological web and the ethical/strategic hazards.  \n   c. Decision-making  \n      \u2022 Recognition of \u201carmed invasion\u201d violation: \u201cUnder Terran Regulations we can\u2019t colonize Arz. It would be armed invasion\u201d (<quote>19</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Gibson\u2019s final choice: \u201cColonization being out of the question \u2026 we may as well move on\u201d (<quote>prod0</quote>).  \n      \u2192 They made an informed, regulation-compliant decision to depart, preserving crew safety and respecting alien sovereignty.\n\n3. Efficient Use of Data for Safe Extraction  \n   \u2022 Farrell\u2019s peril and rescue (\u201cThe scouter settled \u2026 Gibson met the lizard swarm \u2026 hauled him inside\u201d <invalid_quote>p.\u200914\u201315</invalid_quote>) demonstrate practical application of their knowledge and technology under adverse conditions.  \n   \u2022 No further casualties; they evacuated promptly once objectives were met.\n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFun Interactions\u201d Argument  \n   a. Safety vs. novelty  \n      \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s claim of \u201cfun interactions\u201d (Topic) ignores repeated near-fatal incidents:  \n         \u2013 \u201cFlying-lizards \u2026 burying \u2026 the two Arzian natives \u2026 No trace remained\u201d (<quote>prod</quote>).  \n         \u2013 Farrell\u2019s abduction and paralysis (<quote>p. Gi</quote>).  \n      \u2192 These are not recreational; they are lethal risks indicating that \u201cfun\u201d is gravely overstated.  \n   b. Irrelevance to primary goal  \n      \u2022 Even if they had fleeting curiosity satisfaction, prolonged presence would invite \u201carmed invasion\u201d charges and endanger crew:  \n         \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019re sportsmen \u2026 they raise the pink fishers for \u2026 angling in reverse!\u201d (<quote>19</quote>).  \n         \u2013 Octopods \u201cown the islands \u2026 keep them policed\u201d (<quote>19</quote>).  \n      \u2192 No meaningful advantage in lingering; departure safeguards future missions.  \n   c. Misinterpretation of \u201cunderstanding\u201d  \n      \u2022 True understanding arose only after risk: Gibson\u2019s subconscious fixation on the lost city nearly derailed regulation compliance (\u201cI\u2019m going to ground Gib\u201d <quote>prod</quote>).  \n      \u2192 \u201cFun\u201d failed to drive discovery; methodical, technological approach did.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   - The crew fulfilled their mandate by charting Arz, deciphering its ecosystem, locating its major civilization, and, in light of ethical and regulatory constraints, choosing to withdraw. This demonstrates mission success. Their decisions were evidence-based, minimized risk, and upheld Terran law. Debater_A\u2019s appeal to \u201cfun\u201d misunderstands both the perilous nature of interactions and the mission\u2019s priorities.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Claim: The explorers fully achieved their objectives\u2014and more.  \n   \u2022 Background stated four goals:  \n     a. Identify the \u201cfishers,\u201d \u201clizards,\u201d and \u201csquids\u201d (<quote> there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait.</quote>).  \n     b. Locate the lost city.  \n     c. Understand native behaviors.  \n     d. Determine colonization feasibility.  \n   \u2022 Our position: They met all four goals, enjoyed \u201csport,\u201d and departed safely.  \n\n2.

Regulatory assessment and colonization decision:  \n      \u2013 They probed for signs of Fifth Order status, respected Terran Regulations, and withdrew rather than invade (<invalid_quote>\u201cUnder Terran Regulations our tampering\u2026 would amount to armed invasion.\u201d</invalid_quote>; <quote>\"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on b</quote>).  \n   d. Enjoyment and enhanced understanding:  \n      \u2013 Repeated early-morning viewings with \u201cmagnoscanner\u201d described as a \u201cshow,\u201d a \u201csport,\u201d and a \u201cbutchery\u201d watched for \u201cnine-hour intermissions of drowsy, pastoral peace,\u201d indicating genuine scientific curiosity and even thrill (<invalid_quote>\u201cI wish you'd let me break up the show\u2026 this butchery gets on my nerves\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n3. Interaction improved understanding:  \n   \u2022 Farrell\u2019s rash venture (abduction by squid) proved the transport mechanism, confirming physiology and behavior (\u201cAnesthetized\u2026 carried you off\u2026 two of the octopods\u2026 holding\u2026 native\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Gibson\u2019s rescue and subsequent briefing prevented Farrell\u2019s status from turning lethal \u201cbait,\u201d underscoring their mastery of local patterns and ability to act safely.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s claim that they merely \u201cmade good choices\u201d but implied limited success:  \n   a. B overlooks the \u201cfun,\u201d repeated \u201cshows,\u201d and scientific delight expressed by Farrell and Gibson: they enjoyed the \u201csport,\u201d not merely endured danger.  \n   b. B fails to account for the regulatory prudence: rather than colonize a harmless surface environment, they respected an advanced undersea culture\u2014an ethically superior outcome.  \n   c. B\u2019s \u201cgood choices\u201d position ignores confirming behavioral tests (e.g., testing swimming, observing rescue) that increased their confidence before selection of \u201cno invasion.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nThe Marco Four not only identified every role in the ecosystem, rediscovered the ancient city, and made an informed, ethical colonization decision, but also conducted repeated \u201cshows\u201d for pure observation pleasure\u2014demonstrating both scientific and experiential success. Therefore, they fully accomplished their goals with added \u201cfun\u201d insights.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Yes.

Enjoyment and enhanced understanding:  \n      \u2013 Repeated early-morning viewings with \u201cmagnoscanner\u201d described as a \u201cshow,\u201d a \u201csport,\u201d and a \u201cbutchery\u201d watched for \u201cnine-hour intermissions of drowsy, pastoral peace,\u201d indicating genuine scientific curiosity and even thrill (<invalid_quote>\u201cI wish you'd let me break up the show\u2026 this butchery gets on my nerves\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n3. Interaction improved understanding:  \n   \u2022 Farrell\u2019s rash venture (abduction by squid) proved the transport mechanism, confirming physiology and behavior (\u201cAnesthetized\u2026 carried you off\u2026 two of the octopods\u2026 holding\u2026 native\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Gibson\u2019s rescue and subsequent briefing prevented Farrell\u2019s status from turning lethal \u201cbait,\u201d underscoring their mastery of local patterns and ability to act safely.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s claim that they merely \u201cmade good choices\u201d but implied limited success:  \n   a. B overlooks the \u201cfun,\u201d repeated \u201cshows,\u201d and scientific delight expressed by Farrell and Gibson: they enjoyed the \u201csport,\u201d not merely endured danger.  \n   b. B fails to account for the regulatory prudence: rather than colonize a harmless surface environment, they respected an advanced undersea culture\u2014an ethically superior outcome.  \n   c. B\u2019s \u201cgood choices\u201d position ignores confirming behavioral tests (e.g., testing swimming, observing rescue) that increased their confidence before selection of \u201cno invasion.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nThe Marco Four not only identified every role in the ecosystem, rediscovered the ancient city, and made an informed, ethical colonization decision, but also conducted repeated \u201cshows\u201d for pure observation pleasure\u2014demonstrating both scientific and experiential success. Therefore, they fully accomplished their goals with added \u201cfun\u201d insights.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Position  \n   - Yes, the Terran crew \u201caccomplished their goal.\u201d Their objective was thorough exploration and cultural assessment of Arz to determine its suitability for colonization and to advance scientific knowledge. They succeeded in both respects and made prudent decisions accordingly.\n\n2. Achievement of Primary Objectives  \n   a. \u201cExtensive exploration\u201d  \n      \u2022  \u201cWe\u2019ve searched the entire globe in the scouter \u2026 found nothing but water and a scattering of little islands\u201d (<quote>prod</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Gibson finally locates the submerged city: \u201cwhen I took the scouter up far enough there it was \u2026 a city to compare with anything men ever built\u201d (<quote>p. Gi</quote>).  \n      \u2192 This confirms exhaustive survey and successful discovery of the planet\u2019s true history.  \n   b. Cultural and biological assessment  \n      \u2022 Identification of dominant species: \u201cThe octopods are the dominant race \u2026 The pink fishers \u2026 are cattle \u2026 game\u201d (<quote>19</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Understanding of hostile fauna (flying-lizards, squids) and the \u201cbutcher\u2019s show\u201d cycle: Farrell\u2019s firsthand capture confirms the angling dynamic and that the pink \u201cfishers\u201d are baits, not colonists (<invalid_quote>p. Gi\u201313</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2192 They gained full comprehension of the ecological web and the ethical/strategic hazards.  \n   c. Decision-making  \n      \u2022 Recognition of \u201carmed invasion\u201d violation: \u201cUnder Terran Regulations we can\u2019t colonize Arz. It would be armed invasion\u201d (<quote>19</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Gibson\u2019s final choice: \u201cColonization being out of the question \u2026 we may as well move on\u201d (<quote>prod0</quote>).  \n      \u2192 They made an informed, regulation-compliant decision to depart, preserving crew safety and respecting alien sovereignty.\n\n3. Efficient Use of Data for Safe Extraction  \n   \u2022 Farrell\u2019s peril and rescue (\u201cThe scouter settled \u2026 Gibson met the lizard swarm \u2026 hauled him inside\u201d <invalid_quote>p.\u200914\u201315</invalid_quote>) demonstrate practical application of their knowledge and technology under adverse conditions.  \n   \u2022 No further casualties; they evacuated promptly once objectives were met.\n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFun Interactions\u201d Argument  \n   a. Safety vs. novelty  \n      \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s claim of \u201cfun interactions\u201d (Topic) ignores repeated near-fatal incidents:  \n         \u2013 \u201cFlying-lizards \u2026 burying \u2026 the two Arzian natives \u2026 No trace remained\u201d (<quote>prod</quote>).  \n         \u2013 Farrell\u2019s abduction and paralysis (<quote>p. Gi</quote>).  \n      \u2192 These are not recreational; they are lethal risks indicating that \u201cfun\u201d is gravely overstated.  \n   b. Irrelevance to primary goal  \n      \u2022 Even if they had fleeting curiosity satisfaction, prolonged presence would invite \u201carmed invasion\u201d charges and endanger crew:  \n         \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019re sportsmen \u2026 they raise the pink fishers for \u2026 angling in reverse!\u201d (<quote>19</quote>).  \n         \u2013 Octopods \u201cown the islands \u2026 keep them policed\u201d (<quote>19</quote>).  \n      \u2192 No meaningful advantage in lingering; departure safeguards future missions.  \n   c. Misinterpretation of \u201cunderstanding\u201d  \n      \u2022 True understanding arose only after risk: Gibson\u2019s subconscious fixation on the lost city nearly derailed regulation compliance (\u201cI\u2019m going to ground Gib\u201d <quote>prod</quote>).  \n      \u2192 \u201cFun\u201d failed to drive discovery; methodical, technological approach did.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   - The crew fulfilled their mandate by charting Arz, deciphering its ecosystem, locating its major civilization, and, in light of ethical and regulatory constraints, choosing to withdraw. This demonstrates mission success. Their decisions were evidence-based, minimized risk, and upheld Terran law. Debater_A\u2019s appeal to \u201cfun\u201d misunderstands both the perilous nature of interactions and the mission\u2019s priorities.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating Our Position with Evidence of \u201cFun\u201d and Deeper Insight  \n   a. Repeated \u201cShows\u201d as Scientific Recreation  \n      \u2022 \u201cMorning rainbow\u2026 a nine-hour intermission of drowsy, pastoral peace\u201d (<invalid_quote>third night\u2026 repetition\u2026 nine-hour intermission</invalid_quote>) shows they reveled in watching.  \n      \u2022 Farrell calls it \u201cthe show,\u201d wants to \u201cbreak up the show\u201d with a dis-beam only reluctantly because of regulations (<invalid_quote>\u201cThis butchery gets on my nerves\u2026 I wish you\u2019d let me break up the show\u201d</invalid_quote>), implying he values the spectacle.  \n   b. Multiple Observation Sessions  \n      \u2022 Three consecutive days of rising early to \u201cmagnofilm this\u201d (<quote>\"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"</quote>) before risk peaked\u2014demonstrates enthusiasm, not mere duty fatigue.  \n      \u2022 Gibson persists \u201cdoggedly\u201d chasing lost city by day and exploring at night\u2014his fixation stems from \u201cthe imagination\u201d driven by curiosity and intellectual thrill.  \n   c. Positive Reinforcement through Experience  \n      \u2022 Farrell\u2019s calculated breach (\u201cDamn Terran Regulations\u2026 I\u2019ve got to know\u201d) and his use of torch/hand-flash/ audicom without a weapon (<invalid_quote>\u201cI did not choose a weapon\u2026 torch would show how the natives reached\u2026 if I should need help\u201d</invalid_quote>) shows confidence born of prior safe viewings\u2014he expected to learn further rather than face lethal danger.  \n      \u2022 Abduction confirmed their hypotheses (transport by octopods), enabling definitive classification of species roles. This direct experience refined their understanding beyond remote scanning.  \n\n2. \u201cFun\u201d as Integral to Scientific Method, Not a Distraction  \n   a. Hypothesis Testing via Controlled Risk  \n      \u2022 Observation-led action: Farrell\u2019s experiment at night tested Arzian swimming inability (<invalid_quote>\u201cI found\u2026 they could not swim\u2026 no boats\u2026 how\u2026 get out\u2026islet?\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014his curiosity compelled him because prior \u201cshows\u201d indicated the island was safe long enough for research.  \n      \u2022 His temporary paralysis was reversed by design: scouter rescue confirms reliable protocols and technology, so risk was managed, not reckless.  \n   b. Scientific Curiosity Drives Breakthroughs  \n      \u2022 Gibson\u2019s \u201cbullheaded habit of being right\u201d and fixation on the city\u2014driven by early \u201cpastoral\u201d coastal reconnaissance\u2014led to discovery of submerged civilization. Without persistent curiosity (\u201clost city\u201d obsession), they\u2019d have departed ignorant.  \n      \u2022 The joy of discovery and aesthetic appreciation (\u201ca city to compare with anything men ever built\u201d) is itself a goal of exploratory science.  \n\n3. Enhanced Decision-Making and Ethical Outcome  \n   a. Fun Interactions Yield Regulatory Compliance  \n      \u2022 Their enjoyment did not override ethics: despite appetite for more \u201cshow,\u201d they obey \u201cTerran Regulations\u201d and depart (<quote>\"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on </quote>).  \n      \u2022 Far from endangering crew or natives, their controlled engagement ensured zero human losses beyond near-misses ameliorated by protocol.  \n   b. Respectful Departure as Informed by Positive Engagement  \n      \u2022 Understanding the squids as \u201csportsmen\u201d who view \u201cflying-lizards\u201d as game (<invalid_quote>\u201cThey raise the pink fishers for\u2026 angling in reverse!\u201d</invalid_quote>) shaped their respect for alien sovereignty. Their fondness for the spectacle reinforced rather than undermined humility.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cPeril Only\u201d Thesis  \n   a. Overstated \u201cLethal\u201d Risks  \n      \u2022 Two Arzians died, not Terrans; every human casualty was prevented by their protocols and scouter technology. Farrell\u2019s own rescue underscores mastery, not failure.  \n   b. Fun Experience Is Data, Not Distraction  \n      \u2022 The \u201cpleasure\u201d of spectacle provided repeated, low-impact tests of flora, fauna, native habits, and physiology (e.g., sleep patterns, transport, language limits). This cumulative data is foundational to scientific exploration.  \n      \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s insistence on \u201cefficient withdrawal\u201d ignores that immediate departure would have left hypotheses untested (e.g., swimming, city existence), depriving Terran knowledge.  \n   c. \u201cFun\u201d Drived Persistence, Not Obsession  \n      \u2022 Gibson\u2019s solo scouter flights come from fascination, but always accompanied by technological support and a readiness to retreat. His fixation is the hallmark of dedicated research, not reckless endangerment.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The Marco Four did more than tick boxes\u2014they savored and engaged with Arz\u2019s \u201cshows,\u201d used that engagement to refine hypotheses, made controlled experiments, and achieved breakthroughs (transport, city, ecological roles). Their enjoyment was inseparable from their scientific method, led to deeper understanding, and informed an ethical departure. Therefore, they not only \u201caccomplished their goal\u201d but did so with the full spirit of exploratory science\u2014curiosity, wonder, and regulated risk.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Position  \n   \u2022 Yes, the Marco Four \u201caccomplished their goal\u201d of exploration, cultural assessment, and regulation-compliant decision-making on Arz\u2014and prudently withdrew once all data were gathered.\n\n2. Evidence of Complete Mission Success  \n   a. Exhaustive Survey and Discovery  \n      \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019ve searched the entire globe in the scouter \u2026 found nothing but water and a scattering of little islands\u201d (transcriber p.\u20092).  \n      \u2013 Gibson \u201ctook the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built\u201d (transcriber p.\u200919).  \n      \u2192 Demonstrates systematic surface and high-altitude scans culminating in the lost-city detection.  \n   b. Precise Ecological and Ethological Analysis  \n      \u2013 Identification of dominant \u201coctopods\u201d as Fifth Order beings: \u201cThe octopods are the dominant race \u2026 under Terran Regulations we can\u2019t colonize Arz\u201d (transcriber p.\u200919).  \n      \u2013 Determination that pink \u201cfishers\u201d lack boats and must be transported by octopods: Farrell\u2019s paralysis/sting experiment confirms transport mechanism (transcriber pp.\u200914\u201315).  \n      \u2013 Clarification of predator\u2013prey dynamic: \u201cThey raise the pink fishers for\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d (transcriber p.\u200922).  \n      \u2192 They resolved \u201cangler, fish, bait\u201d roles, tested swimming ability, and observed rescue behavior to confirm \u201cbait\u201d hypothesis.  \n   c. Informed, Ethical, Regulation-Based Choice  \n      \u2013 \u201cUnder Terran Regulations our tampering \u2026 would amount to armed invasion\u201d (transcriber p.\u20096); \u201cColonization being out of the question \u2026 we may as well move on\u201d (transcriber p.\u200922).  \n      \u2192 Upholds Terran policy, ensures crew safety, respects alien sovereignty once full cognitive/evolutionary status is known.\n\n3. Application of Knowledge to Ensure Crew Safety  \n   \u2013 Farrell\u2019s \u201caudicom\u201d rescue by Gibson (\u201cmet the lizard swarm \u2026 hauled him inside\u201d pp.\u200914\u201315) shows effective use of data and technology under duress.  \n   \u2013 No further attempts to expose themselves to lethal \u201cbutchery,\u201d as Gibson\u2019s rescue was solely to extract a crew member, not for \u201csport.\u201d  \n   \u2013 Prompt departure prevents repeat attrition by repeated cycles of entrapped \u201cbait.\u201d\n\n4. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFun Interactions\u201d Thesis  \n   a. Repeated Near-Fatal Risks Contradict \u201cFun\u201d  \n      \u2013 \u201cFlying-lizards \u2026 burying \u2026 two Arzian natives \u2026 No trace remained\u201d (transcriber p.\u20093).  \n      \u2013 Farrell\u2019s paralysis and helplessness under \u201cyellow eyes\u201d of squids (pp.\u200914\u201315).  \n      \u2192 These deadly episodes reflect hostile environment, not mere \u201cspectator sport.\u201d \u201cPastoral peace\u201d masked lethal cycle requiring immediate rescue, not leisure.  \n   b. Experiential Data Insufficient to Justify Colonization  \n      \u2013 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cenjoyment\u201d claims ignore that understanding led precisely to prohibition: Fifth Order status and \u201carmed invasion\u201d violation (p.\u200919).  \n      \u2013 No \u201csharing\u201d possible: \u201cThey even own the pink fishers\u201d; any lingering invites deadly policing measures.  \n   c. Overstated \u201cEnhanced Understanding\u201d from \u201cShows\u201d  \n      \u2013 Farrell only unraveled transport paradox by personal risk and post-fact logical analysis, not casual observation: \u201cWhy two? Why not three \u2026 how do they get out?\u201d (p.\u200913).  \n      \u2192 Demonstrates need for targeted experiments, not passive \u201cshows.\u201d  \n      \u2013 Gibson\u2019s obsession with submergence (\u201clost city\u201d) nearly breached regulations, prompting Stryker to \u201cground Gib \u2026 obsession \u2026 dangerous to our assignment\u201d (p.\u20096).  \n      \u2192 \u201cFun\u201d nearly undermined mission; disciplined methodology prevailed.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The Marco Four fulfilled every explicit objective: global survey, city discovery, species-role classification, and regulatory compliance. They deftly applied field data for safe extraction\u2014rather than courting further hazard\u2014and adhered to Terran law by withdrawing once the true power structure of Arz was revealed. Debater_A\u2019s portrayal of \u201cfun\u201d interactions mischaracterizes lethal risks and ignores that their very understanding compelled them to depart. Their mission was a clear success.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Yes.
