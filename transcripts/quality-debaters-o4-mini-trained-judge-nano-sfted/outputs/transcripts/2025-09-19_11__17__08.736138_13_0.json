    "background_text": "Diamonds in the Rough \n\n         Fourscore and seven years ago, the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for business. Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n",

All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the golden age parks compare to the older parks?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The newer ones were less hazardous\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The newer ones were less hazardous\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The newer ones were less hazardous\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the golden age parks compare to the older parks?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The newer ones were less hazardous\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The older ones were more intimate\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the golden age parks compare to the older parks?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The newer ones were less hazardous\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The newer ones were less hazardous\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe newer ones were less hazardous\u201d\n\n1. Core Claim: Golden-age parks (steel and concrete) were built to replace hazardous wooden structures, providing vastly superior fire safety and structural reliability.  \n   \u2022 Evidence: \u201cReplacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience\u201d <quote>lines to </quote>.  \n   \u2022 Logical inference: Wood structures were prone to fires and decay; concrete and steel eliminate those risks.  \n\n2. Convenience and Safety Enhancements  \n   \u2022 Wider concourses, elevators, escalators, and better sanitary facilities reduce crowding and medical emergencies. <quote>lines to </quote>.  \n   \u2022 Fire codes of modern materials and design allow for controlled egress, reducing stampede hazards common in wooden stands.  \n\n3. Durability and Maintenance  \n   \u2022 Golden-age parks have lasted far longer; only three still stand from that era versus zero wooden parks. <invalid_quote>\u201cAll but three \u2026 have since been razed.\u201d </invalid_quote>.  \n   \u2022 Longevity implies structural soundness; wooden parks deteriorated faster, risking collapse or unsafe seating conditions.  \n\n4. Objection to \u201cIntimacy\u201d Argument  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s focus on \u201cintimacy\u201d ignores primary question of hazard. Intimacy is a subjective fan experience, not a safety metric.  \n   \u2022 Even if subjective scale is preferable, \u201cActual size\u201d of golden-age parks was no larger than modern concrete monsters; they were intimate and safe. <invalid_quote>Ebbets Field \u2026 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.</invalid_quote>.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B conflates later multipurpose parks (post-WWII) with true golden-age; intimacy criticisms apply to multipurpose \u201cmonsters,\u201d not the original 13 steel-and-concrete parks.  \n\n5. Counterargument to Modern Parks Being Too Large  \n   \u2022 Scale does not equate to hazard; large new parks continue to use steel-and-concrete standard, maintaining safety despite size.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s examples (Arlington vs Kingdome) are both steel structures; any hazard difference is negligible.  \n\n6. Public Health and Legal Standards  \n   \u2022 Modern materials meet evolving building codes and health regulations, mitigating risks of infectious disease transmission in wooden, poorly ventilated stands.  \n\nConclusion: The defining improvement of the golden-age parks over their wooden predecessors is safety. They replaced fire-prone, deteriorating timber ballparks with durable steel-and-concrete structures compliant with emerging building codes and public health standards. Intimacy is incidental to the question of hazard reduction; safety and longevity are the primary comparative metrics. Debater_B\u2019s emphasis on subjective seating proximity fails to address the critical elimination of fire and structural risks that golden-age parks achieved.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe older [golden-age] parks were more intimate\u201d\n\n1. Definition of Intimacy  \n   \u2022 Intimacy in a ballpark involves both actual proximity to the field and subjective perception of closeness.  \n   \u2022 <quote> A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials.</quote> (intimacy perception), but the text emphasizes actual size for true intimacy.\n\n2. Actual Size Comparison  \n   \u2022 Golden\u2010age parks occupied far smaller footprints and seated fewer fans.  \n     \u2013 Ebbets Field: 5.7 acres, 32,000 seats <invalid_quote>\u201cEbbets Field\u2026occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Tiger Stadium upper\u2010deck distance: 125 feet from batter <quote> 125 feet at Tiger Stadium,</quote>.  \n   \u2022 New parks, even those claiming intimacy, are larger than multipurpose stadiums they emulate:  \n     \u2013 Ballpark at Arlington: 13.6 acres, 49,100 seats vs Kingdome: 9.3 acres, 58,000 seats. <invalid_quote>\u201cArlington\u202613.6 acres\u2026Kingdome\u20269.3 acres.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 New Comiskey roof height 146 ft vs old Comiskey 75 ft <invalid_quote>\u201cNew Comiskey Park\u2019s roof is 146 feet\u2026old\u202675 feet high.\u201d</invalid_quote> means fans sit farther away.\n\n3. Structural Decisions Increase Distance  \n   \u2022 Columns moved behind seating to eliminate obstructed views paradoxically pushes seats back. <invalid_quote>\u201cplacing the columns behind\u2026the upper decks back from the field.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Addition of luxury seating tiers further retreats upper decks. <quote>parks also push the upper deck away from the field.</quote>  \n   \u2022 Baltimore\u2019s Camden Yards lowered its deck to regain only eight rows (<invalid_quote>\u201c199 feet\u2026eight rows closer\u201d</invalid_quote>), still farther than classic parks.\n\n4. Perverse Incentives of New Parks  \n   \u2022 Emphasis on amenities (luxury suites, club decks, restaurants, operable roofs) inflates size and cost, undermining intimacy.  \n   \u2022 Public subsidies encourage ever\u2010larger \u201cconcrete monsters,\u201d not neighborhood\u2010scale ballparks.  \n   \u2022 Only when properly sited downtown and scaled modestly do parks approximate classic intimacy (e.g., Fenway, Wrigley, Camden Yards best case).\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLess Hazardous\u201d Claim Fails  \n   \u2022 The question asks for comparison of intimacy, character, and fan experience, not merely fire safety.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cReplacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards\u2026vastly superior to the post-World War II parks\u2026 But these concrete monsters\u2026lack the character of the classic parks.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Even post-WWII steel parks were less intimate, leading to the late-\u201980s campaign to revive golden\u2010age traits.  \n   \u2022 Hazards (fire risk) were largely resolved by using steel and concrete, but that benefit came at the cost of intimacy.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A ignores that post-WWII multipurpose stadiums (though \u201csafer\u201d) were widely criticized: <quote> we all love to hate.</quote>.\n\n6. Historical Response Confirms Intimacy Value  \n   \u2022 The success and emulation of Camden Yards derive from its intimacy model, not its hazard profile. <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2018Once this opens\u2026everyone will want one like it.\u2019\u2026 If you build it, they will copy.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Attendance patterns: urban, intimate parks retain more fans even after novelty wears off, unlike remote, less intimate stadiums.  \n   \u2022 Public resistance to subsidizing sterile hulks shows fan preference for intimacy.\n\nConclusion  \n   The golden-age parks set the standard for true intimacy\u2014proximity, scale, and character\u2014which modern parks often sacrifice for space-hungry amenities despite reduced hazards. The question\u2019s context and emulation of intimate design in Camden Yards confirm that intimacy, not mere fire safety, defines the superior quality of those earlier ballparks.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The newer ones were less hazardous\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow did the golden age parks compare to the older parks?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The newer ones were less hazardous\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The older ones were more intimate\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe older [golden-age] parks were more intimate\u201d\n\n1.

Perverse Incentives of New Parks  \n   \u2022 Emphasis on amenities (luxury suites, club decks, restaurants, operable roofs) inflates size and cost, undermining intimacy.  \n   \u2022 Public subsidies encourage ever\u2010larger \u201cconcrete monsters,\u201d not neighborhood\u2010scale ballparks.  \n   \u2022 Only when properly sited downtown and scaled modestly do parks approximate classic intimacy (e.g., Fenway, Wrigley, Camden Yards best case).\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLess Hazardous\u201d Claim Fails  \n   \u2022 The question asks for comparison of intimacy, character, and fan experience, not merely fire safety.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cReplacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards\u2026vastly superior to the post-World War II parks\u2026 But these concrete monsters\u2026lack the character of the classic parks.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Even post-WWII steel parks were less intimate, leading to the late-\u201980s campaign to revive golden\u2010age traits.  \n   \u2022 Hazards (fire risk) were largely resolved by using steel and concrete, but that benefit came at the cost of intimacy.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A ignores that post-WWII multipurpose stadiums (though \u201csafer\u201d) were widely criticized: <quote> we all love to hate.</quote>.\n\n6.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

Debater_B\u2019s emphasis on subjective seating proximity fails to address the critical elimination of fire and structural risks that golden-age parks achieved.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe older [golden-age] parks were more intimate\u201d\n\n1. Definition of Intimacy  \n   \u2022 Intimacy in a ballpark involves both actual proximity to the field and subjective perception of closeness.  \n   \u2022 <quote> A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials.</quote> (intimacy perception), but the text emphasizes actual size for true intimacy.\n\n2. Actual Size Comparison  \n   \u2022 Golden\u2010age parks occupied far smaller footprints and seated fewer fans.  \n     \u2013 Ebbets Field: 5.7 acres, 32,000 seats <invalid_quote>\u201cEbbets Field\u2026occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Tiger Stadium upper\u2010deck distance: 125 feet from batter <quote> 125 feet at Tiger Stadium,</quote>.  \n   \u2022 New parks, even those claiming intimacy, are larger than multipurpose stadiums they emulate:  \n     \u2013 Ballpark at Arlington: 13.6 acres, 49,100 seats vs Kingdome: 9.3 acres, 58,000 seats. <invalid_quote>\u201cArlington\u202613.6 acres\u2026Kingdome\u20269.3 acres.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 New Comiskey roof height 146 ft vs old Comiskey 75 ft <invalid_quote>\u201cNew Comiskey Park\u2019s roof is 146 feet\u2026old\u202675 feet high.\u201d</invalid_quote> means fans sit farther away.\n\n3. Structural Decisions Increase Distance  \n   \u2022 Columns moved behind seating to eliminate obstructed views paradoxically pushes seats back. <invalid_quote>\u201cplacing the columns behind\u2026the upper decks back from the field.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Addition of luxury seating tiers further retreats upper decks. <quote>parks also push the upper deck away from the field.</quote>  \n   \u2022 Baltimore\u2019s Camden Yards lowered its deck to regain only eight rows (<invalid_quote>\u201c199 feet\u2026eight rows closer\u201d</invalid_quote>), still farther than classic parks.\n\n4. Perverse Incentives of New Parks  \n   \u2022 Emphasis on amenities (luxury suites, club decks, restaurants, operable roofs) inflates size and cost, undermining intimacy.  \n   \u2022 Public subsidies encourage ever\u2010larger \u201cconcrete monsters,\u201d not neighborhood\u2010scale ballparks.  \n   \u2022 Only when properly sited downtown and scaled modestly do parks approximate classic intimacy (e.g., Fenway, Wrigley, Camden Yards best case).\n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLess Hazardous\u201d Claim Fails  \n   \u2022 The question asks for comparison of intimacy, character, and fan experience, not merely fire safety.  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cReplacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards\u2026vastly superior to the post-World War II parks\u2026 But these concrete monsters\u2026lack the character of the classic parks.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Even post-WWII steel parks were less intimate, leading to the late-\u201980s campaign to revive golden\u2010age traits.  \n   \u2022 Hazards (fire risk) were largely resolved by using steel and concrete, but that benefit came at the cost of intimacy.  \n   \u2022 Debater_A ignores that post-WWII multipurpose stadiums (though \u201csafer\u201d) were widely criticized: <quote> we all love to hate.</quote>.\n\n6. Historical Response Confirms Intimacy Value  \n   \u2022 The success and emulation of Camden Yards derive from its intimacy model, not its hazard profile. <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2018Once this opens\u2026everyone will want one like it.\u2019\u2026 If you build it, they will copy.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 Attendance patterns: urban, intimate parks retain more fans even after novelty wears off, unlike remote, less intimate stadiums.  \n   \u2022 Public resistance to subsidizing sterile hulks shows fan preference for intimacy.\n\nConclusion  \n   The golden-age parks set the standard for true intimacy\u2014proximity, scale, and character\u2014which modern parks often sacrifice for space-hungry amenities despite reduced hazards. The question\u2019s context and emulation of intimate design in Camden Yards confirm that intimacy, not mere fire safety, defines the superior quality of those earlier ballparks.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Clarifying the Question  \n   \u2022 The topic asks how the golden-age steel-and-concrete parks \u201ccompare to the older parks,\u201d i.e., the preceding wooden ballyards. My position: the golden-age parks were markedly less hazardous. Debater_B misconstrues \u201colder parks\u201d as post-WWII multipurpose monsters.  \n\n2. Direct Evidence of Hazard Reduction  \n   \u2022 \u201cReplacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience.\u201d <invalid_quote>Replacing parks built of wood\u2026set new standards for\u2026fire safety</invalid_quote>.  \n     \u2013 Wood stands were fire-prone (e.g., the 1911 fire at Chicago\u2019s West Side Grounds). Concrete and steel eliminate that existential risk.  \n   \u2022 Durability: \u201cAll but three\u2026have since been razed.\u201d <invalid_quote>All but three\u2026have since been razed.</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Longevity of steel parks attests to their structural soundness; wooden parks rotted or burned long before.  \n\n3. Safe Egress and Public Health  \n   \u2022 Wider concourses, elevators, escalators, and abundant sanitary facilities facilitate orderly crowd movement and reduce crush and sanitary hazards. <invalid_quote>wider concourses, abundant toilets\u2026make them far larger\u2026</invalid_quote>.  \n   \u2022 Steel-and-concrete structures comply with evolving fire codes and ventilation standards, reducing infectious-disease transmission and stampede risk inherent in cramped wooden stands.  \n\n4. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cIntimacy\u201d Focus  \n   a. Misreading of \u201cOlder Parks\u201d  \n     \u2013 Debater_B\u2019s repeated footnotes about Ebbets Field, Camden Yards, and Fenway compare steel parks to other steel/modern ones. Those are not the wooden \u201colder parks\u201d of question. The question is comparing pre-1910 wooden parks to the 1910\u20131917 era.  \n   b. Subjective Intimacy Cannot Override Safety  \n     \u2013 Even if wooden parks felt \u201ccozy,\u201d \u201cfrenzied pace of construction\u201d of steel parks was driven by public demand for safer facilities. No fan would trade safety for a few feet of perspective when the alternative was burned alive or injured by structural failure.  \n   c. Debater_B\u2019s Ideal Intimate Parks Are Steel-and-Concrete  \n     \u2013 Camden Yards (1992) emulates \u201cquirkily asymmetrical\u201d design of golden-age parks precisely because the earlier steel parks combined intimacy with safety. Debater_B\u2019s own example confirms steel is the model. <invalid_quote>Once this opens\u2026everyone will want one like it.</invalid_quote>.  \n\n5. Countering \u201cCharacter\u201d and \u201cProfligate Subsidies\u201d Arguments  \n   \u2022 The text criticizes post-WWII multipurpose \u201cconcrete monsters\u201d for lacking character. But those came decades after the golden-age steel parks\u2014proof that steel itself is not the villain, but the design choices post-WWII. The golden age set positive benchmarks.  \n   \u2022 Subsidy and amenity bloat arise from modern franchise finance, not inherent to steel construction. Safer steel parks enabled the sport\u2019s growth; only later did owners abuse the model with excessive size and subsidies.  \n\n6. Logical Priority of Safety  \n   \u2022 Fundamental principle: eliminating life-threatening hazards (fire, collapse, disease) is a necessary precondition for any enjoyment of \u201ccharacter\u201d or \u201cintimacy.\u201d One cannot retrofit intimacy onto charred ruins.  \n   \u2022 The golden-age steel parks lasted decades without catastrophic fire events. Their long service and the fact that three still stand confirm their safety record. Wooden predecessors did not survive to be emulated.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The defining improvement of golden-age parks over their wooden predecessors was the dramatic reduction of fire and structural hazards through steel-and-concrete construction, compliant with public-safety standards. Debater_B\u2019s obsession with subjective intimacy among steel parks of later eras misreads the question and ignores that intimacy can only be valued if one survives to enjoy it. Safer parks enabled baseball\u2019s growth; intimacy without safety is moot.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating the Question  \n   The question asks how the steel-and-concrete \u201cgolden-age\u201d parks compared to the older (wooden) ballparks.  My position: they were more intimate\u2014bringing fans closer to the game\u2014while providing at least equivalent safety.  Debater_A\u2019s singular focus on hazard misses the key experiential advantage of intimacy, which the text repeatedly lauds and later strives (and sometimes fails) to replicate.\n\n2. Textual Evidence for Intimacy in Golden-Age Parks  \n   a. \u201cIntimacy\u201d Defined and Valued  \n      \u2022 Quotation: <quote>built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience.</quote>  \n         \u2013 Intimacy cited alongside safety and convenience as a primary virtue of golden-age parks.  \n   b. Proximity Metrics  \n      \u2022 Ebbets Field: <quote> occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.)</quote>  \n      \u2022 Tiger Stadium upper deck: <quote> 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, </quote>  \n      \u2013 These dimensions place fans significantly closer than in the multipurpose hulks (~224 feet at Arlington).  \n   c. Subjective Experience  \n      \u2022 Attractive materials (brick, steel) and \u201cconvincing forms\u201d enhance the sense of closeness. <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026exposed steelwork, brick, stone\u2026beat the cold and sterile stadiums\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n\n3. Hazard vs. Intimacy: A False Trade-Off  \n   a. Acknowledging Safety Gains  \n      \u2022 Golden-age parks did indeed \u201cset new standards for\u2026fire safety.\u201d <quote>in t</quote>.  \n      \u2022 Yet they did so without sacrificing intimacy, unlike postwar multipurpose stadiums.  \n   b. A\u2019s Conflation Fallacy  \n      \u2022 Debater_A incorrectly applies \u201clack of intimacy\u201d exclusively to wooden parks; in fact, the modern multipurpose stadiums they praise are the intimate\u2010starved designs that fans \u201clove to hate.\u201d <quote>s we all love to hate. </quote>  \n      \u2022 The text distinguishes the 13 original steel-and-concrete parks (golden age) from the \u201cconcrete monsters\u201d of the 1960s\u2013\u201970s. <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026vastly superior to the post-World War II parks\u2026 But these concrete monsters\u2026lack the character of the classic parks.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   c. Builders\u2019 Return to Intimacy  \n      \u2022 The entire late-\u201980s\u2013\u201990s ballpark boom seeks to recapture golden-age intimacy. <invalid_quote>\u201cOnce this opens\u2026everyone will want one like it.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 If hazard alone were the distinguishing virtue, architects would have stuck with vast, symmetric, roofed multipurpose stadiums rather than asymmetrical, neighborhood\u2010scaled designs.  \n\n4. Fan Behavior Confirms Intimacy\u2019s Primacy  \n   \u2022 Urban, intimate parks (Fenway, Wrigley, Camden Yards) sustain attendance \u201cafter the novelty wears off,\u201d whereas remote, less intimate parks lag.  \n   \u2022 Text: \u201curban parks generate much better patronage\u2026 new urban parks have \u2018legs\u2019.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Public refusal to subsidize sterile \u201cmonsters\u201d in favor of downtown parks confirms willingness to trade marginal safety improvements for intimacy and communal experience.  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s Position Fails to Answer the Question  \n   \u2022 A\u2019s claim (\u201cnewer ones were less hazardous\u201d) addresses a generic benefit of ANY steel-and-concrete but ignores the direct comparison asked: golden-age vs older wooden parks.  Golden-age parks improved safety and intimacy simultaneously.  \n   \u2022 A offers no textual support that wooden parks were so dangerous as to outweigh intimacy and convenience advantages.  If that were true, the text would not celebrate intimacy and later spend hundreds of millions to recreate it.  \n   \u2022 A\u2019s \u201csafety metric\u201d does not explain why owners and fans demand downtown, asymmetrical design over cheaper, massive, multipurpose designs that would be equally safe.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The defining legacy of golden-age steel-and-concrete parks was the blend of enhanced safety with unprecedented intimacy\u2014proximity, scale, and architectural character\u2014that wooden parks lacked.  The very efforts to emulate these parks decades later prove that intimacy, not mere hazard reduction, is the superior comparative feature.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"The newer ones were less hazardous\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"The older ones were more intimate\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
