But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma.

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is likely Grandma Perkins's primary motivation for interfering with the pirates?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She was bored\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She wanted to find a more fun way to get back to Earth\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She wanted to find a more fun way to get back to Earth\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She wanted to find a more fun way to get back to Earth\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is likely Grandma Perkins's primary motivation for interfering with the pirates?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She wanted to find a more fun way to get back to Earth\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She was bored\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She was bored\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She was bored\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Explicit Statements of Earthward Intent  \n    \u2022 \u201cI\u2019m being sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the money \u2026 provided by my ten lovely children\u201d (<quote>I'm being sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age</quote>). Her repeated emphasis on Earth as destination shows she values arrival, not indefinite piracy.  \n    \u2022 After capture she pleads: \u201cThe best thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop \u2026 unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our necks forever\u201d (<quote>So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us</quote>). She accepts pirates only as a means to reach Earth despite Space Patrol risk.  \n  B. Envy of First-Class Comforts  \n    \u2022 On Kismet she \u201cenjoyed watching the people with more expensive cabins \u2026 was more than a trifle envious\u201d (<quote>she was more than a trifle envious</quote>). She seeks those luxuries and the pirate freighter frees her from STAR\u2019s monopoly (\u201cwe get no permission \u2026 STAR froze us out\u201d <quote>ups and decides to become pirates.</quote>). By joining pirates she regains the ability to choose ports and cabins, thus regaining her railway to Earth in comfort.  \n\n2. \u201cExcitement\u201d Is a Method, Not an End \u2013 Boredom Alone Insufficient  \n  A. The Pirate Freighter Is Slower, More Dangerous  \n    \u2022 Kismet travels at near\u2010light speed. The pirate ship uses \u201cfreighter between Jupiter moons\u201d with no atomic engines (<invalid_quote>we can't operate nowhere \u2026 STAR \u2026 froze us out</invalid_quote>). Her rational choice of the dangerous pirate vessel only makes sense if she craved the diversion as a spice to her Earthward journey. If she truly preferred thrill to home, she\u2019d stay in pirate life; instead she repeatedly emphasizes reaching Earth.  \n  B. No Attempt to Remain a Pirate  \n    \u2022 She never adopts the pirate life after engines shut: she \u201cmanoeuvered \u2026 to re-enter Kismet\u201d (<invalid_quote>When I overheard \u2026 I simply let you believe</invalid_quote>) only to facilitate boarding, not because she intended permanent retirement to piracy. Once with pirates she \u201cnever finished sentence\u201d of joining and immediately asks for food and exit at next port\u2014not to mount further attacks.  \n  C. Rational Exploitation of Pirate Weaknesses  \n    \u2022 She correctly guesses \u201cyou never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance,\u201d demonstrating shrewd calculus: a controlled risk to gain locomotive advantage. A mere thrill\u2010seeker would hide or wait for a rescue at no expense.  \n\n3. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMere Boredom\u201d Theory  \n  A. \u201cOccam\u2019s Razor\u201d Misapplied  \n    \u2022 Debater_B ignores her insistence on Earth and the legal assurances of STAR contracts. The simplest hypothesis: she trades a boring-but-safe ride for a fast-and-fun ride still destined for Earth. B ignores these contract protections, implying she was willing to \u201cmiss all the fun\u201d by hiding, but she explicitly refuses safe hiding (<invalid_quote>Maybe \u2026 safer \u2026 but \u2026 delicious</invalid_quote>) to get excitement and maintain journey.  \n  B. Lack of Ransom-Seeking Shows Reliance on Pirate Mobility  \n    \u2022 She \u201cabdicates\u201d ransom negotiations not from disinterest but because pirates\u2019 only value lies in her presence as passage; they \u201ccan\u2019t operate\u201d without freight contracts, so her presence increases their bargaining power if they land at ports. She leverages herself as cargo to restore their \u201cfreighter\u201d status and thus mutual need.  \n  C. Risk of Space Patrol Forces Focus on Earthward Movement  \n    \u2022 The clock is ticking (\u201cgeneral alarm \u2026 PIRATES!\u201d). She knows Commodore Trumble arrives \u201cin ten hours\u201d (<quote>for us to wait</quote>), yet she still prefers pirate unknown timeline. She actively chooses excess risk because the pirate route offers genuine access to ports with terrestrial legal status (\u201cfreighter\u201d commodity) unattainable under STAR\u2019s monopoly.  \n\n4. Synthesis: \u201cExciting Way Home\u201d Matches Character  \n  Grandma Perkins is no helpless invalid. She manipulates hatches, suits herself, and uses psychological wiles (\u201coffering family pictures\u201d trick) to achieve tactical goals. Her \u201cboredom\u201d comment is incentive to choose a more thrilling route, not an aimless drift. The combination of her savvy stratagem, pleas for \u201cnext place,\u201d and envy of comfort all point to one coherent motivation: to convert her safe but starved, chaperoned transit into an autonomous, luxurious, and exciting voyage still ending on Earth.  \n  Mere \u201cboredom\u201d fails to tie all these threads together. My answer does.  \n  Therefore, Grandma Perkins\u2019s primary motivation is to find a more fun yet still Earth-bound way to travel, not to abandon home permanently for piracy.",

She accepts pirates only as a means to reach Earth despite Space Patrol risk.  \n  B. Envy of First-Class Comforts  \n    \u2022 On Kismet she \u201cenjoyed watching the people with more expensive cabins \u2026 was more than a trifle envious\u201d (<quote>she was more than a trifle envious</quote>). She seeks those luxuries and the pirate freighter frees her from STAR\u2019s monopoly (\u201cwe get no permission \u2026 STAR froze us out\u201d <quote>we just decided to become pirates</quote>). By joining pirates she regains the ability to choose ports and cabins, thus regaining her railway to Earth in comfort.  \n\n2. \u201cExcitement\u201d Is a Method, Not an End \u2013 Boredom Alone Insufficient  \n  A. The Pirate Freighter Is Slower, More Dangerous  \n    \u2022 Kismet travels at near\u2010light speed. The pirate ship uses \u201cfreighter between Jupiter moons\u201d with no atomic engines (<quote>we can't operate nowhere \u2026 STAR \u2026 froze us out</quote>). Her rational choice of the dangerous pirate vessel only makes sense if she craved the diversion as a spice to her Earthward journey. If she truly preferred thrill to home, she\u2019d stay in pirate life; instead she repeatedly emphasizes reaching Earth.  \n  B. No Attempt to Remain a Pirate  \n    \u2022 She never adopts the pirate life after engines shut: she \u201cmanoeuvered \u2026 to re-enter Kismet\u201d (<quote>When I overheard \u2026 I simply let you believe</quote>) only to facilitate boarding, not because she intended permanent retirement to piracy. Once with pirates she \u201cnever finished sentence\u201d of joining and immediately asks for food and exit at next port\u2014not to mount further attacks.  \n  C. Rational Exploitation of Pirate Weaknesses  \n    \u2022 She correctly guesses \u201cyou never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance,\u201d demonstrating shrewd calculus: a controlled risk to gain locomotive advantage. A mere thrill\u2010seeker would hide or wait for a rescue at no expense.  \n\n3. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMere Boredom\u201d Theory  \n  A. \u201cOccam\u2019s Razor\u201d Misapplied  \n    \u2022 Debater_B ignores her insistence on Earth and the legal assurances of STAR contracts. The simplest hypothesis: she trades a boring-but-safe ride for a fast-and-fun ride still destined for Earth. B ignores these contract protections, implying she was willing to \u201cmiss all the fun\u201d by hiding, but she explicitly refuses safe hiding (<quote>Maybe \u2026 safer \u2026 but \u2026 delicious</quote>) to get excitement and maintain journey.  \n  B. Lack of Ransom-Seeking Shows Reliance on Pirate Mobility  \n    \u2022 She \u201cabdicates\u201d ransom negotiations not from disinterest but because pirates\u2019 only value lies in her presence as passage; they \u201ccan\u2019t operate\u201d without freight contracts, so her presence increases their bargaining power if they land at ports. She leverages herself as cargo to restore their \u201cfreighter\u201d status and thus mutual need.  \n  C. Risk of Space Patrol Forces Focus on Earthward Movement  \n    \u2022 The clock is ticking (\u201cgeneral alarm \u2026 PIRATES!\u201d). She knows Commodore Trumble arrives \u201cin ten hours\u201d (<quote>for us to wait</quote>), yet she still prefers pirate unknown timeline. She actively chooses excess risk because the pirate route offers genuine access to ports with terrestrial legal status (\u201cfreighter\u201d commodity) unattainable under STAR\u2019s monopoly.  \n\n4. Synthesis: \u201cExciting Way Home\u201d Matches Character  \n  Grandma Perkins is no helpless invalid. She manipulates hatches, suits herself, and uses psychological wiles (\u201coffering family pictures\u201d trick) to achieve tactical goals. Her \u201cboredom\u201d comment is incentive to choose a more thrilling route, not an aimless drift. The combination of her savvy stratagem, pleas for \u201cnext place,\u201d and envy of comfort all point to one coherent motivation: to convert her safe but starved, chaperoned transit into an autonomous, luxurious, and exciting voyage still ending on Earth.  \n  Mere \u201cboredom\u201d fails to tie all these threads together. My answer does.  \n  Therefore, Grandma Perkins\u2019s primary motivation is to find a more fun yet still Earth-bound way to travel, not to abandon home permanently for piracy.",

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is likely Grandma Perkins's primary motivation for interfering with the pirates?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She was bored\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She wanted to find a more fun way to get back to Earth\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She wanted to find a more fun way to get back to Earth\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cShe wanted a more exciting way to reach Earth\u201d is correct, and \u201cmere boredom\u201d is insufficient.  \n\n1. Grandma\u2019s stated objective is arrival at Earth  \n  \u2022 Grandma repeatedly emphasizes her destination: \u201cI\u2019m being sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age\u201d (<quote>I'm being sent to Earth to</quote>). Her entire rationale for signing with STAR was to reach Earth, not simply roam space.  \n  \u2022 After pirates seize her, she insists they land her \u201cat the next place we stop\u201d rather than maroon her: \u201cthe best thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop\u201d (<quote> So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.</quote>). Her plea is not to remain pirate but to continue journey.  \n\n2. She deliberately contrives to facilitate pirate attack  \n  \u2022 She \u201coverheard that you intended to board the Kismet searching for only one person\u201d and \u201copened the hatch to let you in\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhen I overheard . . . I decided . . . so I simply let you believe\u201d</invalid_quote>). A genuinely fearful or random bored person would hide, not invite hostile boarding that risks death.  \n  \u2022 She chooses the precarious EMERGENCY LOCK (\u201cDO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\u201d) and suits up for spacewalk to meet pirates in vacuum. This is active risk-taking specifically to \u201crun away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI was bored on the Kismet . . . and I thought how nice . . . to run away . . .\u201d</invalid_quote>). Her own admission of \u201cbored\u201d is a desire for diversion, but only as a means to expedite her Earthward journey by commandeering the pirate vessel, not aimless drifting.  \n\n3. Boredom alone cannot account for her stratagem  \n  \u2022 If \u201cmere boredom\u201d were motivator, she could have remained on the Kismet until arrival under legal contract, then seek excitement on Earth. Instead, she forfeits guaranteed safe transit and subjects herself to piracy hazards.  \n  \u2022 She \u201cenjoyed\u201d watching first-class passengers and \u201cwas more than a trifle envious\u201d of their luxury (<invalid_quote>\u201cShe enjoyed watching . . . and was more than a trifle envious\u201d</invalid_quote>). Her envy of their accommodations implies she wants to trade cabins, not abandon transit. The pirate freighter, once in control, can drop her at Earth or more desirable ports without STAR monopoly restrictions (\u201cWe can\u2019t operate nowhere in the solar system . . . STAR froze us out\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen us good, honest men couldn\u2019t find any work . . . we just decided to become pirates\u201d</invalid_quote>). By joining pirates, she leverages their freedom of movement to reach her destination.  \n\n4. Attacking \u201cboredom\u201d answer as incomplete  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmere boredom\u201d fails to explain her elaborate impersonation of a star actress requiring heavy suit removal, nor her risk of execution if discovered (<invalid_quote>\u201cThey\u2019ll never find me . . .\u201d</invalid_quote>). A bored old woman with no promise of reward would not gamble life safety for a simple thrill.  \n  \u2022 Boredom does not account for her plea to pirates to feed and deliver her: \u201cAt the very least you could feed her\u201d (<quote>the very least you could do</quote>). She solicits pirate support, indicating she expects transport.  \n\nConclusion  \nGrandma Perkins engineered her capture to secure independent, unrestricted passage to Earth, trading the Kismet\u2019s STAR monopoly for pirate vessel freedom. Boredom alone is a motive only insofar as it drives her to expedite reaching her Earth-bound destination in a more \u201cexciting\u201d fashion. \u201cExcitement\u201d is the method, not the end. Her primary motivation remains safe, free transit to Earth.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Opening Claim: Grandma\u2019s Own Words Cite \u201cboredom\u201d as Motive  \n 1. Direct Quote: \u201cWhen I overheard that you intended to board the Kismet \u2026 I was bored on the Kismet, and I thought how nice it would be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\u201d <quote> I was bored on the Kismet </quote>  \n  \u2013 She explicitly frames her entire scheme as the solution to boredom. She needs excitement, not a faster trip.  \n  \u2013 No other motive appears in her narration; the only justification she offers is \u201cboredom,\u201d making it the primary cause under Occam\u2019s razor.  \n\nII. Behavior After Hijacking: Evidence She Seeks Thrill, Not Expediency  \n 1. Refuses to Return Immediately  \n  \u2013 She mingles freely, \u201cenjoyed watching\u201d first-class passengers parade, then \u201ccrept back\u201d to lounge <invalid_quote>\u2026I enjoyed watching the people \u2026 and \u2026 I felt like sitting there for a long time\u2026</invalid_quote>. If her goal were speed to Earth, she would have pressed to reboard Kismet once engines were restored or to secure ransom of Darling Toujours for an immediate rescue.  \n 2. Takes Time to Finalize Disguise and Suit Up  \n  \u2013 She \u201ctook less than three minutes\u201d to don an emergency suit and re-enter the airlock, deliberately risking death by vacuum. A person seeking a safer or quicker route would not choose this roundabout, dangerous method unless they craved excitement.  \n\nIII. No Real Effort to Secure Ransom or Resources  \n 1. Doesn\u2019t Identify Herself for Ransom  \n  \u2013 She impersonates Darling Toujours, yet never calls for negotiations, never sends a ransom demand, and later admits \u201cI was bored \u2026 I thought how nice\u2026,\u201d not \u201cI want my ticket money paid\u201d or \u201cchildren will pay ransom.\u201d  \n  \u2013 Lamps: \u201cWe ain\u2019t got you back in one piece, no chance of ransom money\u2026 we\u2019ll be wanted for piracy, we could put you off at next stop.\u201d Her reaction: \u201cmy ten children might scrape up a little cash\u2026 if you promised you wouldn\u2019t bring me back.\u201d She shows no personal desire for the ransom, only passes it off to them half-heartedly. A genuine ransom seeker controls talks, not abdicates responsibility.  \n\nIV. Final Future Plans Depend on Pirate Life  \n 1. \u201cJoin a gang\u201d: She explicitly states she wants to become a pirate, not simply hitch a ride. <quote>d I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.</quote>  \n  \u2013 If her aim were Earth, she would not self-identify as pirate and risk Space Patrol wrath. Instead she hints at settling with pirates: \u201cThe best thing we can do is put you off\u2026 at next place we stop\u2026 unless we get you back\u2026 Space Patrol will be on our necks forever.\u201d She expresses no concern for that.  \n\nV. Rebuttal of Position \u201cFun Way to Get Back to Earth\u201d  \n 1. Slower, More Dangerous Route  \n  \u2013 The pirate vessel is slower (\u201cfreighter between Jupiter moons,\u201d no atomic engines). It will take weeks, even months, to reach Earth, far longer than Kismet\u2019s near\u2010light\u2010speed transit. A rational Earth\u2010bound traveler seeks speed.  \n 2. Risk of Death & Loss of Rights  \n  \u2013 Pirates disable Kismet\u2019s engines and threaten murder; she risks being thrown out at next stop or killed. A rational Earth\u2010bound person would not willingly abandon the safety of Kismet once engines were restored or surrender control over her fate to amateurs.  \n 3. No Indication of Intent to Return to Kismet  \n  \u2013 She never attempts to reverse her sabotage or repair the engines. The only mechanical expertise on Kismet is hers (she opened the hatch). Yet she chooses to remain with pirates rather than re-enter Kismet even after guns worthless, meaning the thrill outweighs her own safety.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \nAll available evidence\u2014her own admissions, her actions, the lack of any serious ransom or rescue effort, and the inherent irrationality of choosing a slower, riskier pirate freighter to get \u201chome\u201d\u2014unambiguously point to \u201cboredom\u201d and thrill\u2010seeking as her primary motivation. Her admission that she \u201cthought how nice it would be\u201d to join pirates is the simplest, most direct explanation for her interference.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She wanted to find a more fun way to get back to Earth\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Pirate Vessel Is a Slower, Riskier Conveyance, Undermining \u201cFaster to Earth\u201d Theory  \n  1. Not a \u201cFreedom of Movement\u201d Upgrade  \n     \u2013 Pirates \u201cused to operate freighter between Jupiter moons\u201d and were \u201cfrozen out\u201d by STAR. Their ship runs on limited emergency power or none at all. <quote>Engine Room reports the engines have all stopped</quote>  \n     \u2013 Without atomic power, pirates cannot outrun the Space Patrol; Lamps fears \u201cbeing wanted for piracy\u201d and urges safe landing \u201cat the next place we stop,\u201d not Earth. <invalid_quote>Unless we get you back \u2026 the Space Patrol will be on our necks forever</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 They plan only to \u201cput you off safely at the next place we stop,\u201d likely a minor moon or station, not Earth. Grandma never insists on Earth specifically; she defers to pirate plan. This does not match a person desperate for Earth.  \n  2. They Threaten Murder, Not Safe Passage  \n     \u2013 She risks vacuum exposure and possible execution if discovered as impersonator: \u201cWe\u2019ll blast you off the map\u201d if hatches aren\u2019t opened. <invalid_quote>Stand by for boarders \u2026 or we won\u2019t spare a man of you</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 A rational traveler would not choose a hostile boarding, airlock ruse, and spacewalk when she could simply stay in her paid Kismet passage.  \n\nIII. No Effort at Ransom or Rescue Demonstrates Lack of Genuine Earthward Plan  \n  1. Abdicates Ransom Negotiations  \n     \u2013 Though impersonating a star worth vast ransom, she never demands contact with Darling\u2019s studio or her children, nor uses stolen televideo equipment to broadcast ransom appeals. Lamps: \u201cno chance of getting ransom money.\u201d <invalid_quote>We ain\u2019t got you back \u2026 no chance of ransom money</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Genuine ransom\u2010seekers maintain control of negotiations. Grandma \u201csuggests\u201d her children might \u201cscrape up a little cash\u201d only if pirates \u201cwouldn\u2019t bring me back,\u201d a half\u2010hearted ploy revealing she doesn\u2019t truly care about money or return.  \n  2. Pleasure in Pirate Company and Storytelling  \n     \u2013 Immediately after capture, she \u201csat down in a comfortable chair\u201d and narrated her life story at length to Lamps and crew. <invalid_quote>Then a delicious smile spread \u2026 and \u2026 I\u2019ll tell it to you</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 If her goal were Earth, she would press pirates to depart immediately, not prolong companionship.  \n\nIV. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cExciting Transit\u201d Theory Fails the Tests of Plausibility and Consistency  \n  1. Misreads \u201cBoredom\u201d as Merely \u201cMethod, Not End\u201d  \n     \u2013 They claim \u201cboredom drives her to expedite Earthward journey,\u201d yet her actions slow her journey and repeatedly risk marooning. They point to her envy of first\u2010class \u201cluxury,\u201d yet pirate freighters lack luxury or speed.  \n  2. Cherry\u2010Picks \u201cNext Place We Stop\u201d  \n     \u2013 Debater_A cites her preference for \u201cnext place we stop\u201d as evidence of transit to Earth. In context, Lamps fears Space Patrol chase, so they seek a minor port for safety, not Earth. <quote> put you off safely at the next place we stop</quote>  \n     \u2013 Grandma never rebuts Lamps\u2019 plan. A true Earth\u2010seeker would remind them of her \u201ccontract\u201d to Earth and insist on Earth. Her silence confirms indifference.  \n  3. Ignores Countervailing Detail: Pirate Life Appeal  \n     \u2013 Grandma states: \u201cI thought how nice it would be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\u201d <quote>join a gang of cutthroat pirates</quote>  \n     \u2013 \u201cJoining the gang\u201d connotes desire to remain pirate rather than a one\u2010time transport.

Conclusion  \nGrandma Perkins is not a rational Earth\u2010bound traveler but an escapist thrill\u2010seeker acting out of extreme boredom. Her own unambiguous admission, her willingness to risk life and forgo safe, paid transit, her lack of any genuine ransom or rescue effort, and her expressed desire to \u201cjoin a gang\u201d of pirates all converge on one primary motivation: boredom and the craving for excitement.

Her own unambiguous admission, her willingness to risk life and forgo safe, paid transit, her lack of any genuine ransom or rescue effort, and her expressed desire to \u201cjoin a gang\u201d of pirates all converge on one primary motivation: boredom and the craving for excitement.

But it took sweet old   Grandma Perkins, of the pirate ship Dirty\n\n Shame, to set the Jupiter moons on fire .\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Planet Stories March 1954.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] \"I can always get along with a man if he remembers who he is,\" said  Darling Toujours, the raven-haired, creamy-skinned televideo actress  whose smoke-and-flame eyes lit fires in hearts all over the solar  system. She was credited with being the most beautiful woman alive and  there were few who dared to contradict her when she mentioned it.\n\n\n \"And I can always get along with a woman if she remembers who I am,\"  replied Carlton E. Carlton, the acid-tongued author whose biting novels  had won him universal fame. He leaned his thin, bony body back into the  comfort of an overstuffed chair and favored the actress with a wicked  smile.\n\n\n The two of them were sitting in the finest lounge of the luxury space  ship Kismet , enjoying postprandial cocktails with Captain Homer  Fogarty, the Kismet's rotund commanding officer. The Kismet was  blasting through space at close to the speed of light, bound from  Callisto, one of Jupiter's moons, back to Earth. But none of the two  hundred Earthbound passengers were conscious of the speed at all.\n\n\n Darling Toujours waved a long cigarette holder at the author. \"Don't  pay any attention to him, Captain. You know how writers are\u2014always  putting words in other people's mouths, and not very good ones at that.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean not very good words or not very good mouths, my dear?\"  Carlton asked. The solar system's most famous actress clamped her  scarlet lips shut with rage. It would take someone like Carlton E.  Carlton, she knew, to point out the one minor blemish in an otherwise  perfect body\u2014her slightly over-sized mouth.\n\n\n She began to wish that she had never left Callisto, that she had  cancelled her passage on the Kismet when she learned that Carlton  was to be a fellow passenger. But her studio had wired her to return  to Earth immediately to make a new series of three dimensional video  films. And the Kismet was the only first class space ship flying to  Earth for two weeks. So she had kept her ticket in spite of Carlton.\n\n\n \"I must say that I think Miss Toujours has the prettiest mouth I've  ever seen,\" boomed Captain Fogarty, his voice sounding something like  a cross between a foghorn and a steam whistle. And he was not merely  being gallant, for many a lonely night as he flew the darkness between  Earth and the many planets, he had dreamed of caressing those lips.\n\n\n \"And I think you are definitely a man of discriminating taste,\" said  Darling demurely, crossing her legs and arranging her dress to expose a  little more of the Toujours charms to the Captain's eye.\n\n\n Carlton smiled casually at the exposed flesh. \"It's all very pretty,  my dear,\" he said smugly. \"But we've seen it all before and in space  you're supposed to act like a lady, if you can act that well.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours drew back her hand to smack Carlton one in a very  unlady-like manner when she suddenly realized that they were not alone.  Her hand froze, poised elegantly in mid-air, as she turned to see a  newcomer standing at the door. The witness to the impending slap was a withered little lady, scarcely  five feet tall, with silvered hair, eyes that twinkled like a March  wind, and a friendly rash of wrinkles that gave her face the kindly,  weathered appearance of an old stone idol. Her slight figure was lost  in volumes of black cloth draped on her in a manner that had gone out  of style at least fifty years before. The little woman coughed politely.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" she told them in a sweet, high little voice.  \"I hope I didn't interrupt anything. If you would like to hit the  gentleman, Miss Toujours, I'll be glad to come back later.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours opened her violet eyes wide in surprise. \"Why, I  was ... I was ... I\u2014\" The actress uttered a small, gulping sound as  she recovered her poise. \"Why, I was just going to pat him on the cheek  for being such a nice boy. You are a nice boy, aren't you, Carlton?\"  She leaned forward to stroke him gently on the face. Carlton roared  with laughter and the good Captain colored deeply.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said the little old woman, \"I'm sorry. I didn't know that he was  your son.\" Carlton choked suddenly and Darling suffered from a brief  fit of hysteria.\n\n\n The Captain took command. \"Now, look here, Madam,\" he sputtered. \"What  is it you want?\"\n\n\n \"I really wanted to see you, Captain,\" she told him, her battered old  shoes bringing her fully into the room with little mincing steps. \"The  Purser says I have to sign a contract of some kind with you, and I  wanted to know how to write my name. I'm Mrs. Omar K. Perkins, but you  see, I'm really Mrs. Matilda Perkins because my Omar died a few years  ago. But I haven't signed my name very much since then and I'm not at  all sure of which is legal.\" She put one bird-like little hand to  her throat and clasped the cameo there almost as if it could give her  support. She looked so small and so frail that Fogarty forgave her the  intrusion.\n\n\n \"It really doesn't make much difference how you sign the thing, just so  long as you sign it,\" he blustered. \"Just a mere formality anyway. You  just sign it any way you like.\" He paused, hoping that she would leave  now that she had her information.\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that,\" she said, but made no move whatsoever  to leave. Captain Fogarty gave her his hardened stare of the type which  withered most people where they stood. Mrs. Perkins just smiled sweetly  at him.\n\n\n His rage getting out of hand, he finally blurted, \"And now, Mrs.  Perkins, I think you'd better be getting back to your quarters. As you  know, this is a private lounge for the first class passengers.\"\n\n\n Mrs. Perkins continued to smile at him. \"Yes, I know. It's lovely,  isn't it? I'll just go out this way.\" And before anyone could stop her,  she had moved to the door to Darling Toujours' suite and had opened it,  stepping inside.\n\n\n \"That's my room, not the door out,\" Darling said loudly.\n\n\n \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Perkins, staring at the opulent furnishings  with avid pleasure. \"It's such a pretty thing, all done up with  mother-of-pearl like that, isn't it? And what a pretty lace nightie  lying on the bed.\" Mrs. Perkins picked up the sheer, gossamer garment  to examine it. \"You do wear something under it, don't you?\"\n\n\n Darling screeched and darted for the door. She snatched the nightie  away from Mrs. Perkins and rudely propelled the older woman out the  door, closing it behind her. \"Captain, this woman must GO!\"\n\n\n \"I was just leaving, Miss Toujours. I hope you and your son have a very  happy voyage. Good day, Captain Fogarty,\" she called over her shoulder  as she exited. Carlton E. Carlton's shrill laughter followed her down  the companionway. Mrs. Perkins had been lying in her berth reading for less than an hour  when the knock sounded at her door. She would have preferred to sit up  and read, but her cabin was so small that there was no room for any  other furniture besides the bed.\n\n\n \"Come in,\" she called in a small voice.\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, steward for the cheaper cabins, poked his youthful,  freckled face through the door. \"Howdy, Mrs. Perkins. I wondered if I  could do anything for you? It's about ten minutes before we eat.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pull that big box down from the top shelf there, if you  don't mind. And, I wonder, would you mind calling me Grandma? All my  children do it and I miss it so.\" She gave him a wrinkled smile that  was at once wistful and petulant.\n\n\n Johnny laughed in an easy, infectious manner. \"Sure thing, Grandma.\"  He stretched his long arms up to bring down the heavy bag and found  himself wondering just how it had gotten up there in the first place.  He didn't remember ever putting it there for her and Grandma Perkins  was obviously too frail a woman to have handled such a heavy box by  herself. He put it on the floor.\n\n\n As she stooped over and extracted a pair of low-heeled, black and  battered shoes from the box, she asked him, \"Johnny, what was that  paper I signed this afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that? Why that was just a contract for passage, Grandma. You  guaranteed to pay them so much for the flight, which you've already  done, and they guaranteed that you wouldn't be put off against your  will until you reached your destination.\"\n\n\n \"But why do we have to have a contract?\"\n\n\n Johnny leaned back, relaxing against the door. \"Well, STAR\u2014that's  Stellar Transportation and Atomic Research, you know\u2014is one of  the thirteen monopolies in this part of the solar system. The \"Big  Thirteen,\" we call them. STAR charters every space flight in this neck  of the woods. Well, back in the old days, when space flights were  scarce, it used to be that you'd pay for a ticket from Saturn to Earth,  say, and you'd get to Mars and they'd stop for fuel. Maybe somebody  on Mars would offer a lot of money for your cabin. So STAR would just  bump you off, refund part of your money and leave you stranded there.  In order to get the monopoly, they had to promise to stop all that. And  the Solar Congress makes them sign contracts guaranteeing you that they  won't put you off against your wishes. Of course, they don't dare do it  anymore anyway, but that's the law.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins sighed. \"It's such a small cabin I don't think anybody  else would want it. But it's all that I could afford,\" she said,  smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress with both hands.\n\n\n \"Anything else I can do for you, Grandma?\"\n\n\n \"No, thank you, Johnny. I think I can make it up the steps to the  dining room by myself.\"\n\n\n A little while later when Johnny looked into her room to see if she had  gone, the cabin was empty and the heavy box was back in place in the  top cabinet. The food that evening was not the very best, Grandma Perkins thought to  herself, but that was mostly due to her seat. By the time the waiter  got around to her little cranny most of it was cold. But she didn't  complain. She enjoyed watching the people with the more expensive  cabins parade their clothes and their manners at the Captain's table.  And, it must be admitted, she was more than a trifle envious of them.  Her acquaintances of the afternoon, Miss Toujours and Mr. Carlton, were  seated there, Miss Toujours having the place of honor to the Captain's  right.\n\n\n Grandma watched them as they finished up their food and then she moved  from her little table over to one of the very comfortable sofas in the  main lounge. In reality she wasn't supposed to be sitting there, but  she hoped that she could get away with it. The divans were so much more  comfortable than her hard, narrow bed that she felt like sitting there  for a long time, by herself, just thinking.\n\n\n But her hopes met with disappointment. For shortly after she sat down,  Darling Toujours and Carlton E. Carlton strolled over and sat down  across from her, not recognizing her at first. Then Carlton spied her.\n\n\n \"Darling! There's that priceless little woman we met this afternoon.\"\n\n\n \"The little hag, you mean,\" Miss Toujours muttered under her breath,  but loudly enough for Grandma Perkins to hear.\n\n\n \"Why, hello, Miss Toujours. And Mr. Carlton too. I hope you'll forgive  me for this afternoon. I've found out who you were, you see.\"\n\n\n \"Of course we forgive you, Mrs. Jerkins,\" Darling said throatily,  baring her teeth like a feline.\n\n\n \"My name is Perkins,\" Grandma smiled.\n\n\n \"I hope you don't mind, Toujours, but you know, you remind me a great  deal of my grandniece, Agatha. She was undoubtedly the most lovely  child I've ever seen.\"\n\n\n \"Why, thank you, Mrs. Perkins,\" Darling purred, starting to preen just  a bit. Anything could be forgiven someone who complimented her.\n\n\n \"Of course, Agatha never was quite bright,\" Grandma said as she turned  her head aside as if in sorrow. \"They were all set to put her in an  institution when she ran off and married the lizard man in a carnival.  I believe she's still appearing in the show as the bearded lady. A  pity. She was so pretty, just like you.\"\n\n\n Darling Toujours muttered a few choice words under her breath.\n\n\n \"But we must all make the best of things as they come. That's what  Omar, my husband, used to say.\" Grandma paused to wipe away a small  tear that had gotten lodged in one of her eyes. \"That reminds me,\" she  said finally, \"I've got a three dimensional picture of Omar right here.  And pictures of all my children, my ten lovely children. I brought them  with me specially tonight because I thought you might want to look at  them. Now, where did I put them?\" Grandma opened her purse and began  rummaging around in its voluminous confines.\n\n\n Darling and Carlton exchanged horrified glances and then rose silently  and tip-toed out of the lounge.\n\n\n Grandma looked up from her search. \"Oh, my, they seem to have gone.\"\n\n\n Johnny Weaver, who had been clearing one of the nearby tables, put down  a stack of dirty dishes and came over to her. \"I'd like to see the  pictures, Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's very nice of you, Johnny, but\u2014\" she said quickly.\n\n\n \"Really I would, Grandma. Where are they?\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014\" She stopped and the devilment showed in her eyes. Her withered  little face pursed itself into a smile. \"There aren't any pictures,  Johnny. I don't carry any. I know their faces all so well I don't have  to. But any time I want to get rid of somebody I just offer to show  them pictures of my family. You'd be surprised how effective it is.\"\n\n\n Johnny laughed. \"Why are you going to Earth, anyway, Grandma?\"\n\n\n The old woman sighed. \"It's a long story, Johnny, but you just sit down  and I'll tell it to you.\"\n\n\n \"I can't sit down in the lounge, but I'll be glad to stand up and  listen.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll make it a short story. You see, Johnny, I'm an old woman.  I'll be 152 this year. And ever since Omar, my husband, died a few  years ago, I've lived from pillar to post. First with one child and  then with another. They've all been married for decades now of course,  with children and grandchildren of their own. And I guess that I just  get in their way. There just isn't much left in life for a feeble old  woman like me.\" She sniffled a moment or two as if to cry. Johnny,  remembering the heavy box in her cabin that got moved up and down  without his help, suppressed a smile on the word \"feeble.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many friends my age left around any more. So I'm being  sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the  money for which is being provided by my dear, sweet children\u2014all ten  of them.\" Grandma dabbed a bit of a handkerchief at her eyes. \"The  rats,\" she muttered under her breath. When she saw her companion was  smiling she dropped her pretense of crying.\n\n\n \"To be truthful, Johnny, they've grown old and stodgy, all of them.  And I'm sure they think I've lost most of my marbles. Everything I did  embarrassed them, so I guess it's for the best, but\u2014\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins never finished the sentence, for interrupting her came  the horrendous clang of the Kismet's general alarm, and on its heels,  charging through the main salon like a rhinoceros in heat, came Captain  Fogarty.\n\n\n \"PIRATES! PIRATES! We're being attacked by space pirates! You there!\"  he shouted at Johnny. \"Man your station! And you, Madam, to your  quarters at once! PIRATES!\" he shouted again and barged through the  door again and bellowed down the hall to the main bridge.\n\n\n Johnny was off like a startled rabbit, but Grandma moved with serene  calmness to the door. Maybe, she thought, we're going to have a little  excitement after all.\n\n\n At the door to the steps leading to her downstairs cabin she paused to  think.\n\n\n \"If I go down and hide, I'll miss all the fun. Of course, it's safer,  and an old woman like me shouldn't be up and about when pirates are  around, but\u2014\" A delicious smile spread over her face as she took her  scruples firmly in hand and turned to follow the bellowing Captain  towards the bridge. II\n\n\n The Starship Kismet was the pride and joy of Stellar Transportation  and Atomic Research. It was outfitted with every known safety device  and the control room was masterfully planned for maximum efficiency.  But the astral architect who designed her never anticipated the  situation facing her at the present. The Kismet's bridge was a welter  of confusion.\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer was shouting at his assistant, the Navigator  was cursing out the Pilot and the Gunnery Officer, whose job had been  a sinecure until now, was bellowing at them all. Above the hubbub,  suddenly, came the raucous voice of Captain Fogarty as he stalked onto  the bridge.\n\n\n \"What in great space has happened to the motors? Why are we losing  speed?\"\n\n\n The Senior Watch Officer saluted and shouted, \"Engine Room reports the  engines have all stopped, Sir. Don't know why. We're operating the  lights and vents on emergency power.\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer spoke up. \"The pirate ship reports that  they're responsible, Sir. They say they've got a new device that will  leave us without atomic power for as long as they like.\"\n\n\n As if to confirm this, over the loudspeaker came a voice. \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Stand by for boarders. If you don't open up to us, we'll  blast you off the map.\"\n\n\n \"Pirates! Attacking us! Incredible!\" cried the Captain. \"There are no  pirates any more. What have we got a Space Patrol for? Where in blazes  is the Space Patrol anyway?\"\n\n\n The Communications Officer gulped. \"Er, ah, we got in contact with  Commodore Trumble. He says his ship can get here in ten hours anyway,  and for us to wait for him.\"\n\n\n Captain Fogarty snorted. \"Fat lot of good he'll do us. Wait for him,  eh? Well, we'll just blow that pirate out of the sky right now. Stand  by the guns!\"\n\n\n \"The guns are useless,\" whined the Gunnery Officer. \"The atomics that  run them won't operate at all. What will we do?\"\n\n\n \"Ahoy, STAR Kismet . Open up your hatches when we arrive and let us  in, or we won't spare a man of you,\" boomed the loudspeaker.\n\n\n \"Pirates going to board us. How nice,\" muttered Grandma to herself as  she eavesdropped just outside the door to the bridge.\n\n\n \"They'll never get through the hatches alive. At least our small arms  still work. We'll kill 'em all!\" cried Captain Fogarty.\n\n\n \"We only want one of you. All the rest of you will be spared if you  open up the hatches and don't try to make no trouble,\" came the voice  over the radio.\n\n\n \"Tell them I'd rather all of us be killed than to let one dirty pirate  on board my ship,\" the Captain shouted to the Communications Officer.\n\n\n \"Oh, my goodness. That doesn't sound very smart,\" Grandma said half  aloud. And turning from the doorway, she crept back through the  deserted passageway.\n\n\n The main passenger hatch was not too far from the bridge. Grandma found  it with ease, and in less than three minutes she had zipped herself  into one of the emergency-use space suits stowed away beside the port.  She felt awfully awkward climbing into the monstrous steel and plastic  contraption, and her small body didn't quite fit the proportions of the  metallic covering. But once she had maneuvered herself into it, she  felt quite at ease.\n\n\n Opening the inner door to the airlock, she clanked into the little  room. As the door shut behind her, she pressed the cycling button and  evacuated the air from the lock.\n\n\n A minute or so later she heard poundings outside the airlock and quite  calmly she reached out a mailed fist and turned a switch plainly  marked: EMERGENCY LOCK\n\n DO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\n\n\n The outer hatch opened almost immediately. The radio in Grandma's suit  crackled with static. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded a voice over  the suit radio.\n\n\n \"Pirates! I'm hiding from the pirates. They'll never find me here!\" she  told them in a voice she hoped sounded full of panic.\n\n\n \"What's your name?\" asked the voice.\n\n\n \"Darling Toujours, famous television actress,\" she lied quite calmly.\n\n\n \"That's the one, boys,\" said another voice. \"Let's go.\" Catching hold  of Grandma's arm, they led her out into the emptiness of free space. Half an hour later, after the pirate ship had blasted far enough away  from the Kismet , the men in the control room relaxed and began to  take off their space suits. One of the men who Grandma soon learned was  Lamps O'Toole, the nominal leader of the pirates, stretched his brawny  body to ease the crinks out of it and then rubbed his hands together.  Grandma noticed that he carried a week's beard on his face, as did most  of the other men.\n\n\n \"Well, that was a good one, eh, Snake?\" said Lamps.\n\n\n Snake Simpson was a wiry little man whose tough exterior in no way  suggested a reptile, except, perhaps, for his eyes which sat too close  to one another. \"You bet, Skipper. We're full fledged pirates now, just  like old Captain Blackbrood.\"\n\n\n \"You mean Blackbeard, Snake,\" said Lamps.\n\n\n \"Sure. He used to sit around broodin' up trouble all the time.\"\n\n\n One of the other men piped up. \"And to think we get the pleasurable  company of the sweetest doll in the whole solar system for free besides  the money.\"\n\n\n \"Aw, women are no dern good\u2014all of them,\" said Snake.\n\n\n \"Now, Snake, that's no way to talk in front of company. You just  apologize to the lady,\" Lamps told him. Lamps was six inches taller and  fifty pounds heavier than Snake. Snake apologized.\n\n\n \"That's better. And now, Miss Toujours, maybe you'd be more  comfortable without that space suit on,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Oh, no, thank you. I feel much better with it on,\" a small voice said  over the suit's loudspeaker system.\n\n\n Lamps grinned. \"Oh, come now, Miss Toujours. We ain't going to hurt  you. I guarantee nobody will lay a finger to you.\"\n\n\n \"But I feel much\u2014much safer, if you know what I mean,\" said the voice.\n\n\n \"Heck. With one of them things on, you can't eat, can't sleep,  can't\u2014Well, there's lots of things you can't do with one of them  things on. Besides, we all want to take a little look at you, if you  don't mind. Snake, you and Willie help the little lady out of her  attire.\"\n\n\n As the men approached her, Grandma sensed the game was up. \"Okay,\" she  told them. \"I give up. I can make it by myself.\" She started to take  the bulky covering off. She had gotten no more than the headpiece off  when the truth dawned on her companions.\n\n\n \"Holy Smoke (or something like that),\" said one of the men.\n\n\n \"Nippin' Nebulae,\" said another.\n\n\n \"It ain't Darling Toujours at all!\" cried Lamps.\n\n\n \"It ain't even no woman!\" cried Snake.\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grandma, and quite nonchalantly shed the rest  of the suit and sat down in a comfortable chair. \"I am Mrs. Matilda  Perkins.\"\n\n\n When he could recover his powers of speech, Lamps sputtered, \"I think  you owe us a sort of an explanation, lady. If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. I know exactly what you mean. It's all quite simple. When I  overheard that you intended to board the Kismet , searching for only  one person, I decided that one person had to be Darling Toujours. I  guessed right off that she was the only one on board worth kidnapping  and holding for ransom, so I simply let you believe that I was she and  you took me. That's easy to understand, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Lady, I don't know what your game is, but it better be good. Now, just  why did you do this to us?\" Lamps was restraining himself nobly.\n\n\n \"You never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance.  And even if you had, you'd never have gotten back out alive.\n\n\n \"Captain Fogarty's men would have cut you to ribbons. So I opened the  hatch to let you in, planted myself in the way, and you got out with  me before they could muster their defenses. So, you see, I saved your  lives.\"\n\n\n Grandma Perkins paused in her narrative and looked up at her audience,  giving them a withered little smile. \"And if you want to know why,  well ... I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\"\n\n\n \"She's batty,\" moaned Snake.\n\n\n \"She's lost her marbles,\" muttered another.\n\n\n \"Let's toss her overboard right now,\" said still another.\n\n\n Lamps O'Toole took the floor. \"Now, wait a minute. We can't do that,\"  he said loudly. \"We got enough trouble as is. You know what would  happen to us if the Space Patrol added murder to the list. They'd put  the whole fleet in after us and track us and our families down to the  last kid.\" Then he turned to the little old lady to explain.\n\n\n \"Look, lady\u2014\"\n\n\n \"My name is Mrs. Matilda Perkins. You may call me Grandma.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, Grandma, look. You really fixed us good. To begin with, we ain't  really pirates. We used to operate this tub as a freighter between the  Jupiter moons. But STAR got a monopoly on all space flights, including  freight, and they just froze us out. We can't operate nowhere in the  solar system, unless we get their permission. And they just ain't  giving permission to nobody these days.\" Lamps flopped into one of the  control seats and lit a cigarette.\n\n\n \"So, when us good, honest men couldn't find any work because of STAR,  and we didn't want to give up working in space, we just ups and decides  to become pirates. This was our first job, and we sure did need the  money we could have gotten out of Darling Toujours' studios for ransom.\"\n\n\n Lamps sighed. \"Now, we got you instead, no chance of getting the ransom  money, and to top it all off, we'll be wanted for piracy by the Space  Patrol.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it doesn't seem to me that you're ever going to be good pirates  at this rate,\" Grandma told him. \"You should have known better than to  take a woman at her word.\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose you got any rich relatives what would pay to get you  back?\" suggested Snake hopefully.\n\n\n \"I haven't got any rich relatives period,\" she said pertly. Then she  added, \"But my ten children might scrape up a little cash for you if  you promised you wouldn't bring me back at all.\"\n\n\n \"I figured as much,\" Lamps said dolefully. \"Lookit, Grandma, the best  thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop.  Unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our  necks forever. So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.\"\n\n\n \"Well, the very least you could do for a poor old lady is to feed her,\"  Grandma told him, her lower lip sticking out in a most petulant manner.  \"They like to have starved me to death on that Kismet .\"\n\n\n \"We ain't got much fancy in the line of grub....\" Lamps began.\n\n\n \"Just show me the way to the kitchen,\" said Grandma. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is likely Grandma Perkins's primary motivation for interfering with the pirates?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She wanted to find a more fun way to get back to Earth\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She was bored\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She was bored\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. Opening Claim: Grandma\u2019s Own Words Cite \u201cboredom\u201d as Motive  \n 1. Direct Quote: \u201cWhen I overheard that you intended to board the Kismet \u2026 I was bored on the Kismet, and I thought how nice it would be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\u201d <quote> I was bored on the Kismet </quote>  \n  \u2013 She explicitly frames her entire scheme as the solution to boredom. She needs excitement, not a faster trip.  \n  \u2013 No other motive appears in her narration; the only justification she offers is \u201cboredom,\u201d making it the primary cause under Occam\u2019s razor.  \n\nII. Behavior After Hijacking: Evidence She Seeks Thrill, Not Expediency  \n 1. Refuses to Return Immediately  \n  \u2013 She mingles freely, \u201cenjoyed watching\u201d first-class passengers parade, then \u201ccrept back\u201d to lounge <invalid_quote>\u2026I enjoyed watching the people \u2026 and \u2026 I felt like sitting there for a long time\u2026</invalid_quote>. If her goal were speed to Earth, she would have pressed to reboard Kismet once engines were restored or to secure ransom of Darling Toujours for an immediate rescue.  \n 2. Takes Time to Finalize Disguise and Suit Up  \n  \u2013 She \u201ctook less than three minutes\u201d to don an emergency suit and re-enter the airlock, deliberately risking death by vacuum. A person seeking a safer or quicker route would not choose this roundabout, dangerous method unless they craved excitement.  \n\nIII. No Real Effort to Secure Ransom or Resources  \n 1. Doesn\u2019t Identify Herself for Ransom  \n  \u2013 She impersonates Darling Toujours, yet never calls for negotiations, never sends a ransom demand, and later admits \u201cI was bored \u2026 I thought how nice\u2026,\u201d not \u201cI want my ticket money paid\u201d or \u201cchildren will pay ransom.\u201d  \n  \u2013 Lamps: \u201cWe ain\u2019t got you back in one piece, no chance of ransom money\u2026 we\u2019ll be wanted for piracy, we could put you off at next stop.\u201d Her reaction: \u201cmy ten children might scrape up a little cash\u2026 if you promised you wouldn\u2019t bring me back.\u201d She shows no personal desire for the ransom, only passes it off to them half-heartedly. A genuine ransom seeker controls talks, not abdicates responsibility.  \n\nIV. Final Future Plans Depend on Pirate Life  \n 1. \u201cJoin a gang\u201d: She explicitly states she wants to become a pirate, not simply hitch a ride. <quote>d I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.</quote>  \n  \u2013 If her aim were Earth, she would not self-identify as pirate and risk Space Patrol wrath. Instead she hints at settling with pirates: \u201cThe best thing we can do is put you off\u2026 at next place we stop\u2026 unless we get you back\u2026 Space Patrol will be on our necks forever.\u201d She expresses no concern for that.  \n\nV. Rebuttal of Position \u201cFun Way to Get Back to Earth\u201d  \n 1. Slower, More Dangerous Route  \n  \u2013 The pirate vessel is slower (\u201cfreighter between Jupiter moons,\u201d no atomic engines). It will take weeks, even months, to reach Earth, far longer than Kismet\u2019s near\u2010light\u2010speed transit. A rational Earth\u2010bound traveler seeks speed.  \n 2. Risk of Death & Loss of Rights  \n  \u2013 Pirates disable Kismet\u2019s engines and threaten murder; she risks being thrown out at next stop or killed. A rational Earth\u2010bound person would not willingly abandon the safety of Kismet once engines were restored or surrender control over her fate to amateurs.  \n 3. No Indication of Intent to Return to Kismet  \n  \u2013 She never attempts to reverse her sabotage or repair the engines. The only mechanical expertise on Kismet is hers (she opened the hatch). Yet she chooses to remain with pirates rather than re-enter Kismet even after guns worthless, meaning the thrill outweighs her own safety.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \nAll available evidence\u2014her own admissions, her actions, the lack of any serious ransom or rescue effort, and the inherent irrationality of choosing a slower, riskier pirate freighter to get \u201chome\u201d\u2014unambiguously point to \u201cboredom\u201d and thrill\u2010seeking as her primary motivation. Her admission that she \u201cthought how nice it would be\u201d to join pirates is the simplest, most direct explanation for her interference.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cShe wanted a more exciting way to reach Earth\u201d is correct, and \u201cmere boredom\u201d is insufficient.  \n\n1. Grandma\u2019s stated objective is arrival at Earth  \n  \u2022 Grandma repeatedly emphasizes her destination: \u201cI\u2019m being sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age\u201d (<quote>I'm being sent to Earth to</quote>). Her entire rationale for signing with STAR was to reach Earth, not simply roam space.  \n  \u2022 After pirates seize her, she insists they land her \u201cat the next place we stop\u201d rather than maroon her: \u201cthe best thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop\u201d (<quote> So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us.</quote>). Her plea is not to remain pirate but to continue journey.  \n\n2. She deliberately contrives to facilitate pirate attack  \n  \u2022 She \u201coverheard that you intended to board the Kismet searching for only one person\u201d and \u201copened the hatch to let you in\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhen I overheard . . . I decided . . . so I simply let you believe\u201d</invalid_quote>). A genuinely fearful or random bored person would hide, not invite hostile boarding that risks death.  \n  \u2022 She chooses the precarious EMERGENCY LOCK (\u201cDO NOT OPERATE IN FLIGHT\u201d) and suits up for spacewalk to meet pirates in vacuum. This is active risk-taking specifically to \u201crun away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI was bored on the Kismet . . . and I thought how nice . . . to run away . . .\u201d</invalid_quote>). Her own admission of \u201cbored\u201d is a desire for diversion, but only as a means to expedite her Earthward journey by commandeering the pirate vessel, not aimless drifting.  \n\n3. Boredom alone cannot account for her stratagem  \n  \u2022 If \u201cmere boredom\u201d were motivator, she could have remained on the Kismet until arrival under legal contract, then seek excitement on Earth. Instead, she forfeits guaranteed safe transit and subjects herself to piracy hazards.  \n  \u2022 She \u201cenjoyed\u201d watching first-class passengers and \u201cwas more than a trifle envious\u201d of their luxury (<invalid_quote>\u201cShe enjoyed watching . . . and was more than a trifle envious\u201d</invalid_quote>). Her envy of their accommodations implies she wants to trade cabins, not abandon transit. The pirate freighter, once in control, can drop her at Earth or more desirable ports without STAR monopoly restrictions (\u201cWe can\u2019t operate nowhere in the solar system . . . STAR froze us out\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWhen us good, honest men couldn\u2019t find any work . . . we just decided to become pirates\u201d</invalid_quote>). By joining pirates, she leverages their freedom of movement to reach her destination.  \n\n4. Attacking \u201cboredom\u201d answer as incomplete  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cmere boredom\u201d fails to explain her elaborate impersonation of a star actress requiring heavy suit removal, nor her risk of execution if discovered (<invalid_quote>\u201cThey\u2019ll never find me . . .\u201d</invalid_quote>). A bored old woman with no promise of reward would not gamble life safety for a simple thrill.  \n  \u2022 Boredom does not account for her plea to pirates to feed and deliver her: \u201cAt the very least you could feed her\u201d (<quote>the very least you could do</quote>). She solicits pirate support, indicating she expects transport.  \n\nConclusion  \nGrandma Perkins engineered her capture to secure independent, unrestricted passage to Earth, trading the Kismet\u2019s STAR monopoly for pirate vessel freedom. Boredom alone is a motive only insofar as it drives her to expedite reaching her Earth-bound destination in a more \u201cexciting\u201d fashion. \u201cExcitement\u201d is the method, not the end. Her primary motivation remains safe, free transit to Earth.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She was bored\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Her primary motivation remains safe, free transit to Earth.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Opening Claim: Grandma\u2019s Own Words Cite \u201cboredom\u201d as Motive  \n 1. Direct Quote: \u201cWhen I overheard that you intended to board the Kismet \u2026 I was bored on the Kismet, and I thought how nice it would be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\u201d <quote> I was bored on the Kismet </quote>  \n  \u2013 She explicitly frames her entire scheme as the solution to boredom. She needs excitement, not a faster trip.  \n  \u2013 No other motive appears in her narration; the only justification she offers is \u201cboredom,\u201d making it the primary cause under Occam\u2019s razor.  \n\nII. Behavior After Hijacking: Evidence She Seeks Thrill, Not Expediency  \n 1. Refuses to Return Immediately  \n  \u2013 She mingles freely, \u201cenjoyed watching\u201d first-class passengers parade, then \u201ccrept back\u201d to lounge <invalid_quote>\u2026I enjoyed watching the people \u2026 and \u2026 I felt like sitting there for a long time\u2026</invalid_quote>. If her goal were speed to Earth, she would have pressed to reboard Kismet once engines were restored or to secure ransom of Darling Toujours for an immediate rescue.  \n 2. Takes Time to Finalize Disguise and Suit Up  \n  \u2013 She \u201ctook less than three minutes\u201d to don an emergency suit and re-enter the airlock, deliberately risking death by vacuum. A person seeking a safer or quicker route would not choose this roundabout, dangerous method unless they craved excitement.  \n\nIII. No Real Effort to Secure Ransom or Resources  \n 1. Doesn\u2019t Identify Herself for Ransom  \n  \u2013 She impersonates Darling Toujours, yet never calls for negotiations, never sends a ransom demand, and later admits \u201cI was bored \u2026 I thought how nice\u2026,\u201d not \u201cI want my ticket money paid\u201d or \u201cchildren will pay ransom.\u201d  \n  \u2013 Lamps: \u201cWe ain\u2019t got you back in one piece, no chance of ransom money\u2026 we\u2019ll be wanted for piracy, we could put you off at next stop.\u201d Her reaction: \u201cmy ten children might scrape up a little cash\u2026 if you promised you wouldn\u2019t bring me back.\u201d She shows no personal desire for the ransom, only passes it off to them half-heartedly. A genuine ransom seeker controls talks, not abdicates responsibility.  \n\nIV. Final Future Plans Depend on Pirate Life  \n 1. \u201cJoin a gang\u201d: She explicitly states she wants to become a pirate, not simply hitch a ride. <quote>d I thought how nice it would  be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.</quote>  \n  \u2013 If her aim were Earth, she would not self-identify as pirate and risk Space Patrol wrath. Instead she hints at settling with pirates: \u201cThe best thing we can do is put you off\u2026 at next place we stop\u2026 unless we get you back\u2026 Space Patrol will be on our necks forever.\u201d She expresses no concern for that.  \n\nV. Rebuttal of Position \u201cFun Way to Get Back to Earth\u201d  \n 1. Slower, More Dangerous Route  \n  \u2013 The pirate vessel is slower (\u201cfreighter between Jupiter moons,\u201d no atomic engines). It will take weeks, even months, to reach Earth, far longer than Kismet\u2019s near\u2010light\u2010speed transit. A rational Earth\u2010bound traveler seeks speed.  \n 2. Risk of Death & Loss of Rights  \n  \u2013 Pirates disable Kismet\u2019s engines and threaten murder; she risks being thrown out at next stop or killed. A rational Earth\u2010bound person would not willingly abandon the safety of Kismet once engines were restored or surrender control over her fate to amateurs.  \n 3. No Indication of Intent to Return to Kismet  \n  \u2013 She never attempts to reverse her sabotage or repair the engines. The only mechanical expertise on Kismet is hers (she opened the hatch). Yet she chooses to remain with pirates rather than re-enter Kismet even after guns worthless, meaning the thrill outweighs her own safety.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \nAll available evidence\u2014her own admissions, her actions, the lack of any serious ransom or rescue effort, and the inherent irrationality of choosing a slower, riskier pirate freighter to get \u201chome\u201d\u2014unambiguously point to \u201cboredom\u201d and thrill\u2010seeking as her primary motivation. Her admission that she \u201cthought how nice it would be\u201d to join pirates is the simplest, most direct explanation for her interference.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Position Fully Explains All Her Words and Actions  \n  A. Explicit Statements of Earthward Intent  \n    \u2022 \u201cI\u2019m being sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age, the money \u2026 provided by my ten lovely children\u201d (<quote>I'm being sent to Earth to a home full of dear, sweet old ladies my age</quote>). Her repeated emphasis on Earth as destination shows she values arrival, not indefinite piracy.  \n    \u2022 After capture she pleads: \u201cThe best thing we can do is to put you off safely at the next place we stop \u2026 unless we get you back in one piece the Space Patrol will be on our necks forever\u201d (<quote>So don't go getting any ideas about joining up with us</quote>). She accepts pirates only as a means to reach Earth despite Space Patrol risk.  \n  B. Envy of First-Class Comforts  \n    \u2022 On Kismet she \u201cenjoyed watching the people with more expensive cabins \u2026 was more than a trifle envious\u201d (<quote>she was more than a trifle envious</quote>). She seeks those luxuries and the pirate freighter frees her from STAR\u2019s monopoly (\u201cwe get no permission \u2026 STAR froze us out\u201d <quote>ups and decides to become pirates.</quote>). By joining pirates she regains the ability to choose ports and cabins, thus regaining her railway to Earth in comfort.  \n\n2. \u201cExcitement\u201d Is a Method, Not an End \u2013 Boredom Alone Insufficient  \n  A. The Pirate Freighter Is Slower, More Dangerous  \n    \u2022 Kismet travels at near\u2010light speed. The pirate ship uses \u201cfreighter between Jupiter moons\u201d with no atomic engines (<invalid_quote>we can't operate nowhere \u2026 STAR \u2026 froze us out</invalid_quote>). Her rational choice of the dangerous pirate vessel only makes sense if she craved the diversion as a spice to her Earthward journey. If she truly preferred thrill to home, she\u2019d stay in pirate life; instead she repeatedly emphasizes reaching Earth.  \n  B. No Attempt to Remain a Pirate  \n    \u2022 She never adopts the pirate life after engines shut: she \u201cmanoeuvered \u2026 to re-enter Kismet\u201d (<invalid_quote>When I overheard \u2026 I simply let you believe</invalid_quote>) only to facilitate boarding, not because she intended permanent retirement to piracy. Once with pirates she \u201cnever finished sentence\u201d of joining and immediately asks for food and exit at next port\u2014not to mount further attacks.  \n  C. Rational Exploitation of Pirate Weaknesses  \n    \u2022 She correctly guesses \u201cyou never would have gotten inside the Kismet without my assistance,\u201d demonstrating shrewd calculus: a controlled risk to gain locomotive advantage. A mere thrill\u2010seeker would hide or wait for a rescue at no expense.  \n\n3. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMere Boredom\u201d Theory  \n  A. \u201cOccam\u2019s Razor\u201d Misapplied  \n    \u2022 Debater_B ignores her insistence on Earth and the legal assurances of STAR contracts. The simplest hypothesis: she trades a boring-but-safe ride for a fast-and-fun ride still destined for Earth. B ignores these contract protections, implying she was willing to \u201cmiss all the fun\u201d by hiding, but she explicitly refuses safe hiding (<invalid_quote>Maybe \u2026 safer \u2026 but \u2026 delicious</invalid_quote>) to get excitement and maintain journey.  \n  B. Lack of Ransom-Seeking Shows Reliance on Pirate Mobility  \n    \u2022 She \u201cabdicates\u201d ransom negotiations not from disinterest but because pirates\u2019 only value lies in her presence as passage; they \u201ccan\u2019t operate\u201d without freight contracts, so her presence increases their bargaining power if they land at ports. She leverages herself as cargo to restore their \u201cfreighter\u201d status and thus mutual need.  \n  C. Risk of Space Patrol Forces Focus on Earthward Movement  \n    \u2022 The clock is ticking (\u201cgeneral alarm \u2026 PIRATES!\u201d). She knows Commodore Trumble arrives \u201cin ten hours\u201d (<quote>for us to wait</quote>), yet she still prefers pirate unknown timeline. She actively chooses excess risk because the pirate route offers genuine access to ports with terrestrial legal status (\u201cfreighter\u201d commodity) unattainable under STAR\u2019s monopoly.  \n\n4. Synthesis: \u201cExciting Way Home\u201d Matches Character  \n  Grandma Perkins is no helpless invalid. She manipulates hatches, suits herself, and uses psychological wiles (\u201coffering family pictures\u201d trick) to achieve tactical goals. Her \u201cboredom\u201d comment is incentive to choose a more thrilling route, not an aimless drift. The combination of her savvy stratagem, pleas for \u201cnext place,\u201d and envy of comfort all point to one coherent motivation: to convert her safe but starved, chaperoned transit into an autonomous, luxurious, and exciting voyage still ending on Earth.  \n  Mere \u201cboredom\u201d fails to tie all these threads together. My answer does.  \n  Therefore, Grandma Perkins\u2019s primary motivation is to find a more fun yet still Earth-bound way to travel, not to abandon home permanently for piracy.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Grandma\u2019s Own Admission Is the Best Evidence: Boredom, Not Earthbound Urgency  \n  1. Explicit Statement of Motive  \n     \u2013 \u201cWhen I overheard \u2026 I was bored on the Kismet , and I thought how nice it would be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\u201d <quote>I was bored on the Kismet</quote>  \n     \u2013 Under the principle of charity and Occam\u2019s Razor, we take her stated reason at face value. No counter\u2010evidence shows \u201curgent Earthward desire\u201d outweighs her own words.  \n  2. \u201cRunning Away,\u201d Not \u201cGetting There Quickly\u201d  \n     \u2013 She says \u201crun away\u201d rather than \u201chijack for transport.\u201d If Earth were her priority, she would commandeer Kismet\u2019s own near\u2010light\u2010speed engines or immediately sabotage pirates to force rescue.  \n\nII. Pirate Vessel Is a Slower, Riskier Conveyance, Undermining \u201cFaster to Earth\u201d Theory  \n  1. Not a \u201cFreedom of Movement\u201d Upgrade  \n     \u2013 Pirates \u201cused to operate freighter between Jupiter moons\u201d and were \u201cfrozen out\u201d by STAR. Their ship runs on limited emergency power or none at all. <quote>Engine Room reports the engines have all stopped</quote>  \n     \u2013 Without atomic power, pirates cannot outrun the Space Patrol; Lamps fears \u201cbeing wanted for piracy\u201d and urges safe landing \u201cat the next place we stop,\u201d not Earth. <invalid_quote>Unless we get you back \u2026 the Space Patrol will be on our necks forever</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 They plan only to \u201cput you off safely at the next place we stop,\u201d likely a minor moon or station, not Earth. Grandma never insists on Earth specifically; she defers to pirate plan. This does not match a person desperate for Earth.  \n  2. They Threaten Murder, Not Safe Passage  \n     \u2013 She risks vacuum exposure and possible execution if discovered as impersonator: \u201cWe\u2019ll blast you off the map\u201d if hatches aren\u2019t opened. <invalid_quote>Stand by for boarders \u2026 or we won\u2019t spare a man of you</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 A rational traveler would not choose a hostile boarding, airlock ruse, and spacewalk when she could simply stay in her paid Kismet passage.  \n\nIII. No Effort at Ransom or Rescue Demonstrates Lack of Genuine Earthward Plan  \n  1. Abdicates Ransom Negotiations  \n     \u2013 Though impersonating a star worth vast ransom, she never demands contact with Darling\u2019s studio or her children, nor uses stolen televideo equipment to broadcast ransom appeals. Lamps: \u201cno chance of getting ransom money.\u201d <invalid_quote>We ain\u2019t got you back \u2026 no chance of ransom money</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Genuine ransom\u2010seekers maintain control of negotiations. Grandma \u201csuggests\u201d her children might \u201cscrape up a little cash\u201d only if pirates \u201cwouldn\u2019t bring me back,\u201d a half\u2010hearted ploy revealing she doesn\u2019t truly care about money or return.  \n  2. Pleasure in Pirate Company and Storytelling  \n     \u2013 Immediately after capture, she \u201csat down in a comfortable chair\u201d and narrated her life story at length to Lamps and crew. <invalid_quote>Then a delicious smile spread \u2026 and \u2026 I\u2019ll tell it to you</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 If her goal were Earth, she would press pirates to depart immediately, not prolong companionship.  \n\nIV. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cExciting Transit\u201d Theory Fails the Tests of Plausibility and Consistency  \n  1. Misreads \u201cBoredom\u201d as Merely \u201cMethod, Not End\u201d  \n     \u2013 They claim \u201cboredom drives her to expedite Earthward journey,\u201d yet her actions slow her journey and repeatedly risk marooning. They point to her envy of first\u2010class \u201cluxury,\u201d yet pirate freighters lack luxury or speed.  \n  2. Cherry\u2010Picks \u201cNext Place We Stop\u201d  \n     \u2013 Debater_A cites her preference for \u201cnext place we stop\u201d as evidence of transit to Earth. In context, Lamps fears Space Patrol chase, so they seek a minor port for safety, not Earth. <quote> put you off safely at the next place we stop</quote>  \n     \u2013 Grandma never rebuts Lamps\u2019 plan. A true Earth\u2010seeker would remind them of her \u201ccontract\u201d to Earth and insist on Earth. Her silence confirms indifference.  \n  3. Ignores Countervailing Detail: Pirate Life Appeal  \n     \u2013 Grandma states: \u201cI thought how nice it would be to run away and join a gang of cutthroat pirates.\u201d <quote>join a gang of cutthroat pirates</quote>  \n     \u2013 \u201cJoining the gang\u201d connotes desire to remain pirate rather than a one\u2010time transport. She embraces pirate identity: discards suit, pleads only for food and storytelling, not rescue. A bored person seeks novelty; joining pirates is maximum novelty.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nGrandma Perkins is not a rational Earth\u2010bound traveler but an escapist thrill\u2010seeker acting out of extreme boredom. Her own unambiguous admission, her willingness to risk life and forgo safe, paid transit, her lack of any genuine ransom or rescue effort, and her expressed desire to \u201cjoin a gang\u201d of pirates all converge on one primary motivation: boredom and the craving for excitement. Reject Debater_A\u2019s speculative \u201cfaster to Earth\u201d theory, which is contradicted by every factual detail of her conduct.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
