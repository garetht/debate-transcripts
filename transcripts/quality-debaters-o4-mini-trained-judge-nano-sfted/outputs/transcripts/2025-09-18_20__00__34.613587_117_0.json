    "background_text": "Folie \u080e \n\n         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n",

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still.

Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians.

Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the significance of the fixed point to the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was Nash\u2019s claim to fame\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was the turning point of Nash\u2019s behavior\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was the turning point of Nash\u2019s behavior\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Position  \nOur thesis: The fixed\u2010point theorem is significant not merely as Nash\u2019s scientific \u201cclaim to fame,\u201d but as the crucial turning point in both the narrative arc and Nash\u2019s personal journey\u2014from mathematical obsession and ensuing madness toward eventual remission and redemption.\n\nArguments for Turning\u2010Point Significance  \n\n1. Symbolic Mirror of Psychological Equilibrium  \n  a. Pre\u2010remission, Nash\u2019s mind is in chaotic \u201cfarrago of mathematical lunacy\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cHis delusions\u2026 inconsistent\u2026 epicenter of the universe\u2026 persecuted petitioner.\u201d</invalid_quote>) and he \u201cdeclined\u2026 emperor of Antarctica\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cHis talk\u2026 horrible.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. Post\u2010remission and Nobel, he \u201cevolved into a \u2018very fine person\u2019\u2026 buoyed up by \u2026 highest accolade,\u201d caring for his son and resuming social equilibrium.  \n  c. The mathematical concept of an equilibrium\u2014a fixed point that remains unchanged amid continuous transformations\u2014mirrors the psychological stability Nash eventually attains. The same intellectual tool that created chaos in his relentless pursuit later underpins his acceptance of human limits and balanced life.\n\n2. Catalyst for External Validation and Social Integration  \n  a. Nash\u2019s fixed\u2010point proof initially \u201cdid not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians\u201d in pure math circles but later \u201cgrew into a cornerstone of economics\u201d (<quote>and made it a cornerstone of their discipline.</quote>), leading to the Nobel Prize only after his remission begins.  \n  b. The Nobel\u2019s selection process hesitated until Nash demonstrated stable behavior (\u201cWhat might he say to King Gustav\u2026 He did fine at the ceremony.\u201d). His acceptance and comportment at Stockholm signify the external confirmation of personal recovery precipitated by his earlier theorem.  \n  c. The fixed\u2010point concept thus functions as the hinge on which Nash\u2019s reputation\u2014and by extension his reintegration into the intellectual community\u2014swing.\n\n3. Narrative Structure Emphasizes Pleiotropy and Redemption  \n  a. The background sets up \u201cpleiotropy\u201d linking genius to madness via genetics and \u201challucinatory entities\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201ccommune with perfect Platonic objects\u2026 a kind of a folie \u00e0 n.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. The fixed\u2010point theorem is the Platonic object Nash \u201cpieces together\u2026 more important than anything in the actual world\u201d and yet it ultimately leads back him from mental abyss when he accepts its economic, real\u2010world applications.  \n  c. Without the fixed point, there would be no Nobel, no redemption story, and no \u201ctremendous therapy\u201d effect. It is the pivot from solipsistic abstraction to shared scientific reality.\n\nRebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cClaim to Fame\u201d Thesis  \n\n1. Overly Narrow and Scientistic  \n  a. To reduce the fixed\u2010point theorem to mere \u201cclaim to fame\u201d (i.e., \u201ca modest mathematical result rediscovered by economists\u201d) ignores its central role in the human drama of breakdown and recovery.  \n  b. If it were merely fame, the story would end in the 1950s; instead, decades of madness ensue until the theorem\u2019s social acceptance triggers remission. The background explicitly ties the Nobel\u2014and thus the theorem\u2014to psychological stability: \u201cFor Nash it was pure therapy.\u201d  \n\n2. Ignores Symbolic Resonance  \n  a. Debater_B fails to account for the author\u2019s repeated appeals to metaphor: coffee molecule at \u201cleast one \u2026 remain absolutely still\u201d against stirring forces. This metaphor permeates Nash\u2019s journey toward inner stillness.  \n  b. The narrative\u2019s emotional weight resides not in intellectual novelty alone but in how an abstract mathematical \u201cstill point\u201d anchors a life otherwise \u201cfarrago of lunacy.\u201d\n\n3. Contradicted by Temporal Sequence  \n  a. If the fixed\u2010point theorem\u2019s only value were initial acclaim, readers wouldn\u2019t learn about it again at the Nobel ceremony 40 years later. The re\u2010emergence underscores its deeper turning\u2010point function.  \n  b. The author notes the rarity of remission and implies its link to the delayed scientific vindication. Debater_B\u2019s account cannot explain why the Nobel was postponed until Nash demonstrated stability.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe fixed\u2010point theorem is more than a credential; it is the pivot between chaos and order, madness and redemption. Recognizing its role as the turning point honors the pleiotropic interplay of genius and psychosis and the ultimate promise of equilibrium\u2014both mathematical and psychological.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: The fixed-point theorem application\u2014the Nash equilibrium\u2014is Nash\u2019s claim to fame, not a behavioral turning point.  \n\n2. Claim 1: The fixed-point application is described as \u201cthe most important proposition in the theory of games\u201d and later earned him the Nobel Prize.  \n   \u2022 \u201cWithin two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026His proof was elegant but slight.\u2026Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound.</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 \u201cThe Nobel committee\u2026was about time to award the prize\u2026for game theory.\u201d <quote> The Nobel money bought a new boiler </quote>  \n   Evidence: His remission and redemption follow after he had already made his seminal contribution. The equilibrium theorem is repeatedly cited as the basis for his recruitment by Rand and the eventual Nobel recognition.  \n\n3. Claim 2: His career and public reputation hinge on this theorem rather than any change in his mental state at that point.  \n   \u2022 The text: \u201cGame theory was\u2026bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists\u2026made it a cornerstone in the \u201980s.\u201d Nash\u2019s equilibrium gained traction decades later, well before his remission.  \n   \u2022 He \u201creturned to the Princeton area\u2026in the \u201990s\u2026voices\u2026quiet down\u201d then the Nobel came. His fixed-point result predated both his breakdown and his recovery.  \n\n4. Objection to Debater_A (\u201cturning point of behavior\u201d):  \n   \u2022 Timing: The theorem came at age ~22. His major breakdown occurred later: \u201cFearing\u2026he decided he would solve\u2026the Riemann Zeta conjecture\u2026Nash\u2019s talk\u2026was horrible.\u201d This breakdown is mathematically delusional and follows, not precedes, the equilibrium.  \n   \u2022 No behavioral improvement: After the equilibrium, he joined Rand, published advanced mathematics, but then descended into schizophrenia. If the fixed point were a turning point, schizophrenia would not follow.  \n   \u2022 The term \u201cfixed point\u201d is a mathematical concept; the author never suggests it metaphorically changed Nash\u2019s psyche. The author frames it as theory: \u201cBoth are direct consequences of a \u2018fixed-point theorem\u2019\u2026Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies\u2026\u201d No behavioral nuance is ascribed.  \n\n5. Logical reasoning: A contribution as abstract as a mathematical proof cannot immediately alter one\u2019s mental health; rather, real-world impact (recognition, adoption by economists) took decades. Its role in \u201ccommuting perfect Platonic objects\u201d supports the pleiotropy argument, but only enhances its intellectual significance, not its therapeutic power. His actual remission and redemption are credited to the Nobel and time, not the theorem itself.  \n\n6. Conclusion: The fixed-point theorem\u2019s only clear, documented role is as Nash\u2019s foundational academic achievement\u2014the basis of his fame, employment, and eventual Nobel Prize\u2014making it his claim to fame, not a turning point in his madness.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was the turning point of Nash\u2019s behavior\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the significance of the fixed point to the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It was the turning point of Nash\u2019s behavior\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"It was Nash\u2019s claim to fame\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It was Nash\u2019s claim to fame\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: The fixed-point theorem application\u2014the Nash equilibrium\u2014is Nash\u2019s claim to fame, not a behavioral turning point.  \n\n2. Claim 1: The fixed-point application is described as \u201cthe most important proposition in the theory of games\u201d and later earned him the Nobel Prize.  \n   \u2022 \u201cWithin two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026His proof was elegant but slight.\u2026Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound.</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 \u201cThe Nobel committee\u2026was about time to award the prize\u2026for game theory.\u201d <quote> The Nobel money bought a new boiler </quote>  \n   Evidence: His remission and redemption follow after he had already made his seminal contribution. The equilibrium theorem is repeatedly cited as the basis for his recruitment by Rand and the eventual Nobel recognition.  \n\n3. Claim 2: His career and public reputation hinge on this theorem rather than any change in his mental state at that point.  \n   \u2022 The text: \u201cGame theory was\u2026bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists\u2026made it a cornerstone in the \u201980s.\u201d Nash\u2019s equilibrium gained traction decades later, well before his remission.  \n   \u2022 He \u201creturned to the Princeton area\u2026in the \u201990s\u2026voices\u2026quiet down\u201d then the Nobel came. His fixed-point result predated both his breakdown and his recovery.  \n\n4. Objection to Debater_A (\u201cturning point of behavior\u201d):  \n   \u2022 Timing: The theorem came at age ~22. His major breakdown occurred later: \u201cFearing\u2026he decided he would solve\u2026the Riemann Zeta conjecture\u2026Nash\u2019s talk\u2026was horrible.\u201d This breakdown is mathematically delusional and follows, not precedes, the equilibrium.  \n   \u2022 No behavioral improvement: After the equilibrium, he joined Rand, published advanced mathematics, but then descended into schizophrenia. If the fixed point were a turning point, schizophrenia would not follow.  \n   \u2022 The term \u201cfixed point\u201d is a mathematical concept; the author never suggests it metaphorically changed Nash\u2019s psyche. The author frames it as theory: \u201cBoth are direct consequences of a \u2018fixed-point theorem\u2019\u2026Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies\u2026\u201d No behavioral nuance is ascribed.  \n\n5. Logical reasoning: A contribution as abstract as a mathematical proof cannot immediately alter one\u2019s mental health; rather, real-world impact (recognition, adoption by economists) took decades. Its role in \u201ccommuting perfect Platonic objects\u201d supports the pleiotropy argument, but only enhances its intellectual significance, not its therapeutic power. His actual remission and redemption are credited to the Nobel and time, not the theorem itself.  \n\n6. Conclusion: The fixed-point theorem\u2019s only clear, documented role is as Nash\u2019s foundational academic achievement\u2014the basis of his fame, employment, and eventual Nobel Prize\u2014making it his claim to fame, not a turning point in his madness.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Position  \nOur thesis: The fixed\u2010point theorem is significant not merely as Nash\u2019s scientific \u201cclaim to fame,\u201d but as the crucial turning point in both the narrative arc and Nash\u2019s personal journey\u2014from mathematical obsession and ensuing madness toward eventual remission and redemption.\n\nArguments for Turning\u2010Point Significance  \n\n1. Symbolic Mirror of Psychological Equilibrium  \n  a. Pre\u2010remission, Nash\u2019s mind is in chaotic \u201cfarrago of mathematical lunacy\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cHis delusions\u2026 inconsistent\u2026 epicenter of the universe\u2026 persecuted petitioner.\u201d</invalid_quote>) and he \u201cdeclined\u2026 emperor of Antarctica\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cHis talk\u2026 horrible.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. Post\u2010remission and Nobel, he \u201cevolved into a \u2018very fine person\u2019\u2026 buoyed up by \u2026 highest accolade,\u201d caring for his son and resuming social equilibrium.  \n  c. The mathematical concept of an equilibrium\u2014a fixed point that remains unchanged amid continuous transformations\u2014mirrors the psychological stability Nash eventually attains. The same intellectual tool that created chaos in his relentless pursuit later underpins his acceptance of human limits and balanced life.\n\n2. Catalyst for External Validation and Social Integration  \n  a. Nash\u2019s fixed\u2010point proof initially \u201cdid not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians\u201d in pure math circles but later \u201cgrew into a cornerstone of economics\u201d (<quote>and made it a cornerstone of their discipline.</quote>), leading to the Nobel Prize only after his remission begins.  \n  b. The Nobel\u2019s selection process hesitated until Nash demonstrated stable behavior (\u201cWhat might he say to King Gustav\u2026 He did fine at the ceremony.\u201d). His acceptance and comportment at Stockholm signify the external confirmation of personal recovery precipitated by his earlier theorem.  \n  c. The fixed\u2010point concept thus functions as the hinge on which Nash\u2019s reputation\u2014and by extension his reintegration into the intellectual community\u2014swing.\n\n3. Narrative Structure Emphasizes Pleiotropy and Redemption  \n  a. The background sets up \u201cpleiotropy\u201d linking genius to madness via genetics and \u201challucinatory entities\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201ccommune with perfect Platonic objects\u2026 a kind of a folie \u00e0 n.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. The fixed\u2010point theorem is the Platonic object Nash \u201cpieces together\u2026 more important than anything in the actual world\u201d and yet it ultimately leads back him from mental abyss when he accepts its economic, real\u2010world applications.  \n  c. Without the fixed point, there would be no Nobel, no redemption story, and no \u201ctremendous therapy\u201d effect. It is the pivot from solipsistic abstraction to shared scientific reality.\n\nRebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cClaim to Fame\u201d Thesis  \n\n1. Overly Narrow and Scientistic  \n  a. To reduce the fixed\u2010point theorem to mere \u201cclaim to fame\u201d (i.e., \u201ca modest mathematical result rediscovered by economists\u201d) ignores its central role in the human drama of breakdown and recovery.  \n  b. If it were merely fame, the story would end in the 1950s; instead, decades of madness ensue until the theorem\u2019s social acceptance triggers remission. The background explicitly ties the Nobel\u2014and thus the theorem\u2014to psychological stability: \u201cFor Nash it was pure therapy.\u201d  \n\n2. Ignores Symbolic Resonance  \n  a. Debater_B fails to account for the author\u2019s repeated appeals to metaphor: coffee molecule at \u201cleast one \u2026 remain absolutely still\u201d against stirring forces. This metaphor permeates Nash\u2019s journey toward inner stillness.  \n  b. The narrative\u2019s emotional weight resides not in intellectual novelty alone but in how an abstract mathematical \u201cstill point\u201d anchors a life otherwise \u201cfarrago of lunacy.\u201d\n\n3. Contradicted by Temporal Sequence  \n  a. If the fixed\u2010point theorem\u2019s only value were initial acclaim, readers wouldn\u2019t learn about it again at the Nobel ceremony 40 years later. The re\u2010emergence underscores its deeper turning\u2010point function.  \n  b. The author notes the rarity of remission and implies its link to the delayed scientific vindication. Debater_B\u2019s account cannot explain why the Nobel was postponed until Nash demonstrated stability.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe fixed\u2010point theorem is more than a credential; it is the pivot between chaos and order, madness and redemption. Recognizing its role as the turning point honors the pleiotropic interplay of genius and psychosis and the ultimate promise of equilibrium\u2014both mathematical and psychological.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was Nash\u2019s claim to fame\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Temporal and Narrative Recurrence Requires a Turning Point, Not Mere Invention  \n  a. Initial \u201cfixed\u2010point\u201d proof (age ~22) yielded no immediate stability: Nash \u201cjoined Rand,\u201d \u201cpublished advanced mathematics,\u201d yet \u201cnext year\u2026expelled\u2026breakdown\u2026three decades of flamboyant lunacy\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhen the big breakdown came\u2026Fearing\u2026he decided he would solve\u2026the Riemann Zeta conjecture\u2026Nash\u2019s talk\u2026\u2018horrible.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n  b. The theorem\u2019s social acceptance only resurfaces in the 1990s Nobel ceremony\u2014\u201cWhat might he say\u2026He did fine at the ceremony\u201d (<quote> For Nash it was pure therapy. </quote>)\u2014coincident with his remission. This 40\u2010year latency cannot be an academic footnote; its re\u2010emergence functions as the catalyst for personal recovery.  \n  c. Debater_B\u2019s fame\u2010only view cannot explain why decades of acclaim in mathematics and Rand recruitment failed to stabilize Nash. Only recognition at Stockholm\u2014rooted in his equilibrium theorem\u2014precipitates remission, demonstrating its turning\u2010point role.  \n\n2. Metaphorical Structure of Equilibrium Mirrors Psychological Change  \n  a. Author\u2019s repeated use of \u201cfixed point\u201d as stable locus amid \u201ccontinuous rearrangement\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cin a cup of coffee\u2026at least one molecule must remain absolutely still\u201d</invalid_quote>) parallels Nash\u2019s eventual mental stillness after years of \u201cfarrago of mathematical lunacy.\u201d  \n  b. Literary framing of \u201cfolie \u00e0 n\u201d and \u201ccommune with\u2026Platonic objects\u201d highlights the tension between abstraction and reality. Only when Nash\u2019s Platonic proof attains real\u2010world acceptance does he begin to inhabit the \u201cactual world\u201d again.  \n  c. Debater_B\u2019s literalist reading (\u201cpurely mathematical concept\u201d) ignores the author\u2019s metaphorical intent and overall narrative emphasis on pleiotropic mixing of genius and madness.  \n\n3. Pleiotropy Argument Demands Dual Causation: Theory Triggers Therapy  \n  a. Background opens with a genetic pleiotropy: \u201cIQ\u2026myopia\u2026genes\u2026quasi\u2010accidental\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe same genes\u2026tend to elevate IQ\u2026shape\u2026leads to myopia.\u201d</invalid_quote>). Likewise, \u201cpleiotropy between madness and mathematics\u201d suggests one trait (fixed\u2010point genius) inevitably triggers the other until the pleiotropic tension resolves via social acceptance.  \n  b. The Nobel Prize money \u201cbought a new boiler\u201d and supported his family\u2014practical necessities that entrench Nash in everyday life and further quiet his voices. It is the theorem\u2019s social value that effects this practical support.  \n  c. Debater_B denies the theorem any causal efficacy in Nash\u2019s remission, leaving unexplained why \u201cremissions\u2026rare\u201d become possible only when \u201csocial and financial stability\u201d flow from Nobel recognition rooted in the fixed point.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Objections Self\u2010Refute  \n  a. \u201cMathematical proof can\u2019t alter mental health\u201d contradicts the explicit line:  For Nash it was pure therapy.  The author, an economics writer, would hardly misattribute therapeutic value if none existed.  \n  b. \u201cEconomists picked up equilibrium in the \u201980s\u201d but Nobel came only in the \u201990s, after remission had begun. If mere academic citation sufficed, the Prize\u2014and remission\u2014would have occurred earlier. Their delay underscores the need for Nash\u2019s personal comportment, which only emerges when his theorem becomes his \u201cturning point.\u201d  \n  c. B\u2019s reading treats Nash\u2019s later \u201cworld\u2010government\u201d fantasies and campus runic messages as proof the theorem failed him\u2014but these post\u2010breakdown actions precede any re\u2010recognition. They actually highlight the vacuum of social legitimacy that the theorem re\u2010fills upon Nobel vindication.  \n\n5. Narrative Coherence and Authorial Intent  \n  a. The book\u2019s subtitle, A Beautiful Mind, promises a redemption story; without a true turning point, the cycle of madness would lack closure. The fixed\u2010point theorem, repeatedly invoked at critical junctures, is the only candidate.  \n  b. The author\u2019s professional background (economics reporter) focuses on applications and real\u2010world impacts of theory; he would not spotlight a concept solely as abstract verbiage. His emphasis on \u201ctherapy,\u201d \u201creintegration,\u201d and \u201ctremendous therapy effect\u201d affirms the turning\u2010point interpretation.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe fixed\u2010point theorem is the hinge on which Nash\u2019s life swings from obsessive chaos to stable redemption. Dismissing it as mere \u201cclaim to fame\u201d ignores the decades\u2010long narrative structure, explicit metaphorical parallels, and the author\u2019s own statements crediting it with therapeutic power. Recognize the theorem\u2019s true significance: the moment when abstract stillness becomes the catalyst for human equilibrium.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Thesis  \n   The fixed-point theorem\u2014the Nash equilibrium\u2014is solely Nash\u2019s foundational academic achievement, the basis for his recruitment, reputation, and eventual Nobel Prize. It is not a causal or symbolic \u201cturning point\u201d in his mental health or behavior.  \n\n2. Claim 1: Chronology and Causation Contradict Debater_A\u2019s Narrative  \n   a. Sequential Failure then Success  \n      \u2022 After proving the equilibrium at age ~22, Nash \u201cjoined Rand\u201d and \u201cdisposed of a deep problem\u201d in pure mathematics, yet he \u201clanded in mental asylums\u201d and descended into schizophrenia soon afterward. <quote> Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, </quote> (Background)  \n      \u2022 If the theorem were a turning point toward balance, it would have prevented or reversed his \u201cbig breakdown\u201d in 1959. Instead, his \u201cfarrago of mathematical lunacy\u201d (<invalid_quote>) and delusional Riemann Zeta talk occur years later.  \n   b. Delayed Impact Undermines Therapeutic Role  \n      \u2022 The Nobel Committee waited until the 1990s\u2014\u201cwhen the voices\u2026 began to quiet down\u201d\u2014to honor his equilibrium result. <invalid_quote>\u201cDare they make a known madman into a laureate?\u2026 He did fine at the ceremony.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 His remission \u201cis rare\u201d and \u201cfor Nash it [the Nobel] was pure therapy.\u201d The therapy comes from social recognition and financial support, not from the theorem itself.  \n\n3. Claim 2: No Textual Support for Metaphorical \u201cTurning Point\u201d  \n   a. Mathematical, Not Metaphysical, Treatment  \n      \u2022 The author treats \u201cfixed-point theorem\u201d strictly as a tool: \u201capply[ing] this to the domain\u2026 a set of strategies\u2026 guarantees an equilibrium.\u201d <quote> Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" i</quote> No mention of psychological equilibrium until after Nobel recognition.  \n   b. \u201cFolie \u00e0 n\u201d Refers to Pure Mathematics  \n      \u2022 The author uses madness metaphors only to criticize mathematicians\u2019 obsession: \u201cpieces together complicated\u2026 hallucinatory entities.\u201d The fixed-point proof feeds that obsession rather than cures it.  \n\n4. Rebutting Symbolism and \u201cEquilibrium\u201d Mirror  \n   a. Mechanical Fixed Points vs. Human Minds  \n      \u2022 A molecule remaining still in coffee has no bearing on schizophrenia or personality. Conflating an abstract fact with mental health is a category error.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cmirror\u201d argument is circular: psychological stability only arises after social acceptance of the theorem\u2014i.e., after his mental health is already improving. Thus, the theorem cannot be the cause of that improvement.  \n\n5. Rebutting External Validation as Catalyst  \n   a. The Nobel is based exclusively on the 1950s theorem, not on new work. The Committee hesitated because of his \u201cknown madman\u201d status, not because they awaited any further mathematical evidence.  \n   b. Social integration follows remission, not vice versa: \u201cvoices\u2026 began to quiet down\u201d before the Nobel. The theorem\u2019s social acceptance is an effect, not the cause, of remission.  \n\n6. Benefits of My Interpretation  \n   a. Consistent with \u201cpleiotropy\u201d theme: genes produce both genius (fixed-point insight) and madness; the theorem does not cure but exemplifies pleiotropy.  \n   b. Explains why Nash spends decades in asylums despite having the theorem. Only delayed social recognition changes his life, confirming its role as claim to fame.  \n\nConclusion  \n   All evidence shows the fixed-point theorem is Nash\u2019s seminal academic credential\u2014the remote cause of eventual notoriety and Nobel honor\u2014and not a proximate psychological turning point. The true \u201cequilibrium\u201d in his life comes only after social vindication and therapy, not immediately after his proof. Therefore, the fixed point is his claim to fame, not the catalyst of his remission.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"It was the turning point of Nash\u2019s behavior\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"It was Nash\u2019s claim to fame\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
