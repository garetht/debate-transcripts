Nitworth leaned forward,  looking solemn.\n\n\n \"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat  times, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly as  they had appeared. There was no record of where they went.\" He paused  for effect.\n\n\n \"They have now reappeared\u2014occupying the inner planet of this system!\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered. \"That's uninhabited  Terrestrial territory....\"\n\n\n \"Indeed, Mr. Magnan?\" Nitworth smiled icily. \"It appears the Qornt do  not share that opinion.\" He plucked a heavy parchment from a folder  before him, harrumphed and read aloud:\n\n\n His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the  Galactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the  presence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honor  to advise that he will require the use of his outer world on the  thirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive,  Terrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,  and let Those who dare gird for the contest.\n\n\n \"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said.\n\n\n Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.\n\n\n \"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out\u2014\" the Military Attache  began.\n\n\n \"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on  the surface,\" the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interested  frowns to settle into place.\n\n\n \"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial  controlled soil\u2014and without so much as a flicker from the instruments  of the Navigational Monitor Service!\"\n\n\n The Military Attache blinked. \"That's absurd,\" he said flatly. Nitworth  slapped the table.\n\n\n \"We're up against something new, gentlemen! I've considered every  hypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is\u2014the  Qornt fleets are indetectible!\" The Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"In that case, we can't  try conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive  of our own. I recommend a crash project. In the meantime\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll have my boys start in to crack this thing,\" the Chief of the  Confidential Terrestrial Source Section spoke up. \"I'll fit out a  couple of volunteers with plastic beaks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No cloak and dagger work, gentlemen! Long range policy will be  worked out by Deep-Think teams back at the Department. Our role will  be a holding action. Now I want suggestions for a comprehensive,  well rounded and decisive course for meeting this threat. Any  recommendation?\"\n\n\n The Political Officer placed his fingertips together. \"What about a  stiff Note demanding an extra week's time?\"\n\n\n \"No! No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected. \"I'd say a calm,  dignified, aggressive withdrawal\u2014as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the Military  Attache said. \"Let's delay the withdrawal\u2014say, until tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"Early tomorrow,\" Magnan said. \"Or maybe later today.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I see you're of a mind with me,\" Nitworth nodded. \"Our plan of  action is clear, but it remains to be implemented. We have a population  of over fifteen million individuals to relocate.\" He eyed the  Political Officer. \"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk  by oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions.  Harried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room. Magnan  eased toward the door.\n\n\n \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped.\n\n\n \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq. It  was a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr. Ambassador. Be sure to  let us know how it works out.\"\n\n\n \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of  chores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field  experience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these  Qornt personally.\"\n\n\n Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n\n\n \"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\"\n\n\n \"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my  head and do something rash if I go.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses. Take Retief along.  No dawdling, now! I want you on the way in two hours. Notify the  transport pool at once. Now get going!\"\n\n\n Magnan nodded unhappily and went into the hall.\n\n\n \"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said. Retief turned.\n\n\n \"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves\u2014in any  direction.\" II\n\n\n Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope  of towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among  flamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of  white beach with the blue sea beyond.\n\n\n \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we  couldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why  don't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can  observe.\"\n\n\n \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to  think of sightseeing.\"\n\n\n \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n\n\n \"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're  questioning Corps policy!\"\n\n\n \"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it  might be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm  not back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"\n\n\n \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"\n\n\n \"It's directly down-slope\u2014\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan  clutched at his arm.\n\n\n There was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy  branch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,  green-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like  steps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set  among bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed  as the creature cocked its head, listening.\n\n\n Magnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed  directly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of  a giant trunk.\n\n\n \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps  into the brush.\n\n\n A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun,  darted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its  narrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,  turned\u2014and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the  right. All three went down in a tangle of limbs.\n\n\n Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and  stopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.\n\n\n \"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of  them.\" \"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless  countenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.  \"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall and faces like that!\"\n\n\n The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over  a bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green  trousers.\n\n\n \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing  Magnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to  you.\"\n\n\n Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering  with peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n\n\n \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n\n\n \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk  about. How many of you are there?\"\n\n\n \"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n\n\n \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\n\n\n The alien whistled shrilly.\n\n\n \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n\n\n \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n\n\n \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous  straits at the moment. I may fly into another rage, you know.\"\n\n\n \"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished\u2014\" a small  whistle escaped\u2014\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Aren't you a Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped  the beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it  happens.\"\n\n\n \"You certainly look like Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, not at all\u2014except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are  sturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course,  they do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n\n\n \"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all! A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock\u2014descended from a  common ancestor, perhaps.\"\n\n\n \"We are all Pud's creatures.\"\n\n\n \"What are the differences between you, then?\"\n\n\n \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation  for the finer things of life. One dreads to contemplate descending to their level.\"\n\n\n \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador  at Smorbrod?\" Retief asked. The beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n\n\n \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures  had established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to  such matters.\"\n\n\n \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps  up, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they  said.\"\n\n\n \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"  Retief asked.\n\n\n \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n\n\n \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we  hurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the  evacuees!\"\n\n\n \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in  all?\"\n\n\n Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.  There are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And  interplanetary relations are rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n\n\n Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke  to his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n\n\n \"What did he say?\"\n\n\n \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to  gather you as specimens.\"\n\n\n \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking  creature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n\n\n \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n\n\n \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic  accent.\"\n\n\n \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of  reception would we get?\"\n\n\n \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the  Rheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy  mating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up  with their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice  of you.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who  have issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who  openly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their  midst?\"\n\n\n \"If at all possible.\"\n\n\n Retief got to his feet.\n\n\n \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and  attract a little attention.\" III\n\n\n \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan  puffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,  they seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led  into a trap?\"\n\n\n \"We can't.\"\n\n\n Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n\n\n Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n\n\n The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great  brush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the  hillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n\n\n \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll  excuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt  Hall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n\n\n \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are  plotting mischief.\"\n\n\n \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n\n\n \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a  patient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan  announced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your  military leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n\n\n \"This is Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n\n\n \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan  muttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n\n\n The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down  steeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,  ducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what  appeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n\n\n \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These  creatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n\n\n Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained  high-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They  can be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n\n\n \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n\n\n \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've  scheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n\n\n \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it  that these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this  sort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n\n\n \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques  before, but this is madness!\"\n\n\n \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the  yellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward. The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval  chamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with  tattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed  spears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power  rifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great  guttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length  of the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror  polish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and  paper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and  cast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n\n\n Lesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,  bird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of  three strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an  intricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of  the magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried  on a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n\n\n \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.  \"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the  feasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n\n\n \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really  must hurry along\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word  with him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from  the other Centers as well.\"\n\n\n \"What kind of vessels? Warships?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,  tonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units  comprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n\n\n \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.  They mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of  thing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually  identical, except for the personal touches each individual has given  his ship.\"\n\n\n \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as  though these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set  of toy sailboats!\"\n\n\n Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can  see that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n\n\n \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll  kindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer  the matter to committee.\"\n\n\n \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss  having a cosy chat.\"\n\n\n There was a pause.\n\n\n \"Ah ... Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Zubb has just presented a most  compelling argument....\" Retief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol  in one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at  Magnan's chest.\n\n\n \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n\n\n \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n\n\n \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy  of the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp  have been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's  anything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now  step along, please.\"\n\n\n \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n\n\n \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\n \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n\n\n \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n\n\n \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief  stepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at  the head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,  staring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,  followed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table  faded.\n\n\n Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped  forward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his  chair\u2014a low, heavily padded stool\u2014and stared unwinking at Retief,  moving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to  bear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy  hair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned  face, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz  surrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress  of scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of  pink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n\n\n Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n\n\n Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n\n\n \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match  between you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,  but he's got timbre.\"\n\n\n \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or  Smorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?  A compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the  table. \"The answer is no !\"\n\n\n Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that  one.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;  you'd best chain him, too.\"\n\n\n \"Why, your Excellency\u2014\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n\n\n \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on  you.\"\n\n\n \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I  don't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!  I want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the  table. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\" There was a momentary silence from all sides.\n\n\n \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with  flame-colored plumes.\n\n\n Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he  bassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I  thought I'd made my point!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n \"I'm convinced.\"\n\n\n Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's  us.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n\n\n Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not  convinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the  table at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring  eyes.\n\n\n \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants  anyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"  He belched again.\n\n\n A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a  crash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped  three loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n\n\n \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.  Four loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around  them. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the  ends and closed it.\n\n\n \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a  bit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n\n\n \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n\n\n \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:  we carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,  say\u2014and ship them back.\"\n\n\n \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending  us home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"  Retief commented.\n\n\n \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a  reasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that  they're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n\n\n Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"  he hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n\n\n \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.  \"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can  assure you, it's useless. We Qornt like to fight.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"  Retief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver  an Ultimatum.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n\n\n \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new  type hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in  seventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\" IV\n\n\n \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of  Qornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links  stretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like  to go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead  you. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014\" Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n\n\n \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n\n\n Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"  he honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n\n\n \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers  with a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n\n\n \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n\n\n \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in  battle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,  we could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to  prove anything.\"\n\n\n \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the  rest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Over my dead body!\"\n\n\n \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in  the house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the  floor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\" Magnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And  did you notice the size of those hands?\"\n\n\n Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.  \"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I  doubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds  here.\"\n\n\n \"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,  I'll get a crack at him.\"\n\n\n Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n\n\n \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n\n\n Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed  arms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet  clacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors  and bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the  combatants.\n\n\n Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at  Retief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn  bent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took  him just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief  leaped clear.\n\n\n Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's  off-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to  the floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind  the narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his  weight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an  awkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching  in vain for Retief.\n\n\n Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n\n\n \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official  diplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested  parties.\"\n\n\n Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your  weapons, Zubb.\"\n\n\n \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n\n\n \"I may lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed  them to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned  back to watch the encounter.\n\n\n Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound  it to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's  shoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped  it around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn  flopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his  neck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n\n\n \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.  Qorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor  with a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs  and gay silks.\n\n\n Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n\n\n The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good  time to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,  seated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish  trussing Qorn up for me.\"\n\n\n \"But we must select a leader!\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\" \"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine  glass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like  to fight.\"\n\n\n \"We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, as  Qornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush  things?\"\n\n\n \"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of  government over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\"\n\n\n \"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always one  among us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to follow  him.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Because that's the way it's done.\"\n\n\n \"Why not do it another way?\" Magnan offered. \"Now, I'd like to suggest  community singing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what would  happen?\"\n\n\n \"Live too long?\" Magnan looked puzzled.\n\n\n \"When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, with  the new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.  The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize  into Verpp\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will become  warmongers like Qorn?\"\n\n\n \"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old  saying goes.\"\n\n\n \"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\"\n\n\n \"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What  about taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\"\n\n\n \"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to  sit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing  off to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But  we prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you  Terrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea what  your strength was.\"\n\n\n \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've  had diplomatic relations and all\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we're  Qornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.\"\n\n\n \"But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!\"\n\n\n \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if  he orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other  Centers\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is  definitely on.\"\n\n\n \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could  name some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal  here....\" ",

Nitworth leaned forward,  looking solemn.\n\n\n \"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat  times, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly as  they had appeared. There was no record of where they went.\" He paused  for effect.\n\n\n \"They have now reappeared\u2014occupying the inner planet of this system!\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered. \"That's uninhabited  Terrestrial territory....\"\n\n\n \"Indeed, Mr. Magnan?\" Nitworth smiled icily. \"It appears the Qornt do  not share that opinion.\" He plucked a heavy parchment from a folder  before him, harrumphed and read aloud:\n\n\n His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the  Galactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the  presence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honor  to advise that he will require the use of his outer world on the  thirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive,  Terrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,  and let Those who dare gird for the contest.\n\n\n \"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said.\n\n\n Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.\n\n\n \"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out\u2014\" the Military Attache  began.\n\n\n \"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on  the surface,\" the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interested  frowns to settle into place.\n\n\n \"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial  controlled soil\u2014and without so much as a flicker from the instruments  of the Navigational Monitor Service!\"\n\n\n The Military Attache blinked. \"That's absurd,\" he said flatly. Nitworth  slapped the table.\n\n\n \"We're up against something new, gentlemen! I've considered every  hypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is\u2014the  Qornt fleets are indetectible!\" The Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"In that case, we can't  try conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive  of our own. I recommend a crash project. In the meantime\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll have my boys start in to crack this thing,\" the Chief of the  Confidential Terrestrial Source Section spoke up. \"I'll fit out a  couple of volunteers with plastic beaks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No cloak and dagger work, gentlemen! Long range policy will be  worked out by Deep-Think teams back at the Department. Our role will  be a holding action. Now I want suggestions for a comprehensive,  well rounded and decisive course for meeting this threat. Any  recommendation?\"\n\n\n The Political Officer placed his fingertips together. \"What about a  stiff Note demanding an extra week's time?\"\n\n\n \"No! No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected. \"I'd say a calm,  dignified, aggressive withdrawal\u2014as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the Military  Attache said. \"Let's delay the withdrawal\u2014say, until tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"Early tomorrow,\" Magnan said. \"Or maybe later today.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I see you're of a mind with me,\" Nitworth nodded. \"Our plan of  action is clear, but it remains to be implemented. We have a population  of over fifteen million individuals to relocate.\" He eyed the  Political Officer. \"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk  by oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions.  Harried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room. Magnan  eased toward the door.\n\n\n \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped.\n\n\n \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq. It  was a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr. Ambassador. Be sure to  let us know how it works out.\"\n\n\n \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of  chores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field  experience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these  Qornt personally.\"\n\n\n Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n\n\n \"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\"\n\n\n \"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my  head and do something rash if I go.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses. Take Retief along.  No dawdling, now! I want you on the way in two hours. Notify the  transport pool at once. Now get going!\"\n\n\n Magnan nodded unhappily and went into the hall.\n\n\n \"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said. Retief turned.\n\n\n \"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves\u2014in any  direction.\" II\n\n\n Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope  of towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among  flamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of  white beach with the blue sea beyond.\n\n\n \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we  couldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why  don't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can  observe.\"\n\n\n \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to  think of sightseeing.\"\n\n\n \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n\n\n \"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're  questioning Corps policy!\"\n\n\n \"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it  might be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm  not back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"\n\n\n \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"\n\n\n \"It's directly down-slope\u2014\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan  clutched at his arm.\n\n\n There was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy  branch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,  green-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like  steps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set  among bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed  as the creature cocked its head, listening.\n\n\n Magnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed  directly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of  a giant trunk.\n\n\n \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps  into the brush.\n\n\n A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun,  darted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its  narrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,  turned\u2014and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the  right. All three went down in a tangle of limbs.\n\n\n Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and  stopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.\n\n\n \"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of  them.\" \"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless  countenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.  \"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall and faces like that!\"\n\n\n The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over  a bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green  trousers.\n\n\n \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing  Magnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to  you.\"\n\n\n Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering  with peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n\n\n \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n\n\n \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk  about. How many of you are there?\"\n\n\n \"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n\n\n \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\n\n\n The alien whistled shrilly.\n\n\n \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n\n\n \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n\n\n \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous  straits at the moment. I may fly into another rage, you know.\"\n\n\n \"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished\u2014\" a small  whistle escaped\u2014\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Aren't you a Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped  the beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it  happens.\"\n\n\n \"You certainly look like Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, not at all\u2014except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are  sturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course,  they do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n\n\n \"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all! A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock\u2014descended from a  common ancestor, perhaps.\"\n\n\n \"We are all Pud's creatures.\"\n\n\n \"What are the differences between you, then?\"\n\n\n \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation  for the finer things of life. One dreads to contemplate descending to their level.\"\n\n\n \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador  at Smorbrod?\" Retief asked. The beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n\n\n \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures  had established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to  such matters.\"\n\n\n \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps  up, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they  said.\"\n\n\n \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"  Retief asked.\n\n\n \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n\n\n \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we  hurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the  evacuees!\"\n\n\n \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in  all?\"\n\n\n Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.  There are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And  interplanetary relations are rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n\n\n Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke  to his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n\n\n \"What did he say?\"\n\n\n \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to  gather you as specimens.\"\n\n\n \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking  creature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n\n\n \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n\n\n \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic  accent.\"\n\n\n \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of  reception would we get?\"\n\n\n \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the  Rheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy  mating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up  with their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice  of you.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who  have issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who  openly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their  midst?\"\n\n\n \"If at all possible.\"\n\n\n Retief got to his feet.\n\n\n \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and  attract a little attention.\" III\n\n\n \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan  puffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,  they seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led  into a trap?\"\n\n\n \"We can't.\"\n\n\n Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n\n\n Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n\n\n The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great  brush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the  hillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n\n\n \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll  excuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt  Hall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n\n\n \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are  plotting mischief.\"\n\n\n \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n\n\n \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a  patient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan  announced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your  military leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n\n\n \"This is Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n\n\n \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan  muttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n\n\n The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down  steeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,  ducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what  appeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n\n\n \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These  creatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n\n\n Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained  high-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They  can be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n\n\n \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n\n\n \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've  scheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n\n\n \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it  that these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this  sort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n\n\n \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques  before, but this is madness!\"\n\n\n \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the  yellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward. The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval  chamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with  tattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed  spears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power  rifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great  guttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length  of the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror  polish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and  paper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and  cast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n\n\n Lesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,  bird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of  three strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an  intricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of  the magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried  on a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n\n\n \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.  \"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the  feasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n\n\n \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really  must hurry along\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word  with him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from  the other Centers as well.\"\n\n\n \"What kind of vessels? Warships?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,  tonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units  comprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n\n\n \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.  They mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of  thing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually  identical, except for the personal touches each individual has given  his ship.\"\n\n\n \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as  though these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set  of toy sailboats!\"\n\n\n Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can  see that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n\n\n \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll  kindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer  the matter to committee.\"\n\n\n \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss  having a cosy chat.\"\n\n\n There was a pause.\n\n\n \"Ah ... Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Zubb has just presented a most  compelling argument....\" Retief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol  in one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at  Magnan's chest.\n\n\n \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n\n\n \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n\n\n \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy  of the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp  have been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's  anything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now  step along, please.\"\n\n\n \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n\n\n \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\n \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n\n\n \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n\n\n \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief  stepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at  the head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,  staring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,  followed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table  faded.\n\n\n Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped  forward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his  chair\u2014a low, heavily padded stool\u2014and stared unwinking at Retief,  moving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to  bear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy  hair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned  face, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz  surrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress  of scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of  pink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n\n\n Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n\n\n Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n\n\n \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match  between you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,  but he's got timbre.\"\n\n\n \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or  Smorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?  A compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the  table. \"The answer is no !\"\n\n\n Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that  one.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;  you'd best chain him, too.\"\n\n\n \"Why, your Excellency\u2014\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n\n\n \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on  you.\"\n\n\n \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I  don't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!  I want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the  table. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\" There was a momentary silence from all sides.\n\n\n \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with  flame-colored plumes.\n\n\n Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he  bassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I  thought I'd made my point!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n \"I'm convinced.\"\n\n\n Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's  us.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n\n\n Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not  convinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the  table at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring  eyes.\n\n\n \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants  anyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"  He belched again.\n\n\n A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a  crash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped  three loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n\n\n \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.  Four loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around  them. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the  ends and closed it.\n\n\n \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a  bit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n\n\n \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n\n\n \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:  we carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,  say\u2014and ship them back.\"\n\n\n \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending  us home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"  Retief commented.\n\n\n \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a  reasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that  they're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n\n\n Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"  he hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n\n\n \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.  \"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can  assure you, it's useless. We Qornt like to fight.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"  Retief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver  an Ultimatum.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n\n\n \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new  type hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in  seventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\" IV\n\n\n \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of  Qornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links  stretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like  to go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead  you. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014\" Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n\n\n \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n\n\n Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"  he honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n\n\n \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers  with a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n\n\n \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n\n\n \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in  battle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,  we could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to  prove anything.\"\n\n\n \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the  rest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Over my dead body!\"\n\n\n \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in  the house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the  floor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\" Magnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And  did you notice the size of those hands?\"\n\n\n Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.  \"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I  doubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds  here.\"\n\n\n \"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,  I'll get a crack at him.\"\n\n\n Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n\n\n \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n\n\n Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed  arms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet  clacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors  and bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the  combatants.\n\n\n Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at  Retief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn  bent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took  him just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief  leaped clear.\n\n\n Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's  off-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to  the floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind  the narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his  weight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an  awkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching  in vain for Retief.\n\n\n Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n\n\n \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official  diplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested  parties.\"\n\n\n Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your  weapons, Zubb.\"\n\n\n \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n\n\n \"I may lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed  them to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned  back to watch the encounter.\n\n\n Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound  it to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's  shoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped  it around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn  flopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his  neck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n\n\n \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.  Qorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor  with a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs  and gay silks.\n\n\n Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n\n\n The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good  time to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,  seated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish  trussing Qorn up for me.\"\n\n\n \"But we must select a leader!\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\" \"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine  glass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like  to fight.\"\n\n\n \"We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, as  Qornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush  things?\"\n\n\n \"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of  government over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\"\n\n\n \"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always one  among us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to follow  him.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Because that's the way it's done.\"\n\n\n \"Why not do it another way?\" Magnan offered. \"Now, I'd like to suggest  community singing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what would  happen?\"\n\n\n \"Live too long?\" Magnan looked puzzled.\n\n\n \"When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, with  the new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.  The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize  into Verpp\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will become  warmongers like Qorn?\"\n\n\n \"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old  saying goes.\"\n\n\n \"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\"\n\n\n \"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What  about taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\"\n\n\n \"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to  sit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing  off to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But  we prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you  Terrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea what  your strength was.\"\n\n\n \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've  had diplomatic relations and all\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we're  Qornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.\"\n\n\n \"But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!\"\n\n\n \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if  he orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other  Centers\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is  definitely on.\"\n\n\n \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could  name some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal  here....\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho would make the least warlike Qornt?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A passive Verpp\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"An angry Verpp\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"An angry Verpp\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"An angry Verpp\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Nitworth leaned forward,  looking solemn.\n\n\n \"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat  times, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly as  they had appeared. There was no record of where they went.\" He paused  for effect.\n\n\n \"They have now reappeared\u2014occupying the inner planet of this system!\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered. \"That's uninhabited  Terrestrial territory....\"\n\n\n \"Indeed, Mr. Magnan?\" Nitworth smiled icily. \"It appears the Qornt do  not share that opinion.\" He plucked a heavy parchment from a folder  before him, harrumphed and read aloud:\n\n\n His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the  Galactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the  presence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honor  to advise that he will require the use of his outer world on the  thirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive,  Terrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,  and let Those who dare gird for the contest.\n\n\n \"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said.\n\n\n Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.\n\n\n \"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out\u2014\" the Military Attache  began.\n\n\n \"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on  the surface,\" the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interested  frowns to settle into place.\n\n\n \"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial  controlled soil\u2014and without so much as a flicker from the instruments  of the Navigational Monitor Service!\"\n\n\n The Military Attache blinked. \"That's absurd,\" he said flatly. Nitworth  slapped the table.\n\n\n \"We're up against something new, gentlemen! I've considered every  hypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is\u2014the  Qornt fleets are indetectible!\" The Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"In that case, we can't  try conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive  of our own. I recommend a crash project. In the meantime\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll have my boys start in to crack this thing,\" the Chief of the  Confidential Terrestrial Source Section spoke up. \"I'll fit out a  couple of volunteers with plastic beaks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No cloak and dagger work, gentlemen! Long range policy will be  worked out by Deep-Think teams back at the Department. Our role will  be a holding action. Now I want suggestions for a comprehensive,  well rounded and decisive course for meeting this threat. Any  recommendation?\"\n\n\n The Political Officer placed his fingertips together. \"What about a  stiff Note demanding an extra week's time?\"\n\n\n \"No! No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected. \"I'd say a calm,  dignified, aggressive withdrawal\u2014as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the Military  Attache said. \"Let's delay the withdrawal\u2014say, until tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"Early tomorrow,\" Magnan said. \"Or maybe later today.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I see you're of a mind with me,\" Nitworth nodded. \"Our plan of  action is clear, but it remains to be implemented. We have a population  of over fifteen million individuals to relocate.\" He eyed the  Political Officer. \"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk  by oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions.  Harried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room. Magnan  eased toward the door.\n\n\n \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped.\n\n\n \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq. It  was a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr. Ambassador. Be sure to  let us know how it works out.\"\n\n\n \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of  chores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field  experience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these  Qornt personally.\"\n\n\n Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n\n\n \"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\"\n\n\n \"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my  head and do something rash if I go.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses. Take Retief along.  No dawdling, now! I want you on the way in two hours. Notify the  transport pool at once. Now get going!\"\n\n\n Magnan nodded unhappily and went into the hall.\n\n\n \"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said. Retief turned.\n\n\n \"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves\u2014in any  direction.\" II\n\n\n Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope  of towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among  flamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of  white beach with the blue sea beyond.\n\n\n \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we  couldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why  don't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can  observe.\"\n\n\n \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to  think of sightseeing.\"\n\n\n \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n\n\n \"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're  questioning Corps policy!\"\n\n\n \"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it  might be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm  not back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"\n\n\n \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"\n\n\n \"It's directly down-slope\u2014\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan  clutched at his arm.\n\n\n There was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy  branch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,  green-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like  steps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set  among bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed  as the creature cocked its head, listening.\n\n\n Magnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed  directly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of  a giant trunk.\n\n\n \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps  into the brush.\n\n\n A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun,  darted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its  narrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,  turned\u2014and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the  right. All three went down in a tangle of limbs.\n\n\n Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and  stopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.\n\n\n \"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of  them.\" \"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless  countenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.  \"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall and faces like that!\"\n\n\n The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over  a bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green  trousers.\n\n\n \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing  Magnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to  you.\"\n\n\n Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering  with peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n\n\n \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n\n\n \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk  about. How many of you are there?\"\n\n\n \"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n\n\n \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\n\n\n The alien whistled shrilly.\n\n\n \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n\n\n \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n\n\n \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous  straits at the moment. I may fly into another rage, you know.\"\n\n\n \"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished\u2014\" a small  whistle escaped\u2014\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Aren't you a Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped  the beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it  happens.\"\n\n\n \"You certainly look like Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, not at all\u2014except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are  sturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course,  they do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n\n\n \"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all! A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock\u2014descended from a  common ancestor, perhaps.\"\n\n\n \"We are all Pud's creatures.\"\n\n\n \"What are the differences between you, then?\"\n\n\n \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation  for the finer things of life. One dreads to contemplate descending to their level.\"\n\n\n \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador  at Smorbrod?\" Retief asked. The beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n\n\n \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures  had established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to  such matters.\"\n\n\n \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps  up, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they  said.\"\n\n\n \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"  Retief asked.\n\n\n \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n\n\n \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we  hurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the  evacuees!\"\n\n\n \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in  all?\"\n\n\n Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.  There are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And  interplanetary relations are rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n\n\n Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke  to his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n\n\n \"What did he say?\"\n\n\n \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to  gather you as specimens.\"\n\n\n \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking  creature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n\n\n \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n\n\n \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic  accent.\"\n\n\n \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of  reception would we get?\"\n\n\n \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the  Rheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy  mating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up  with their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice  of you.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who  have issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who  openly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their  midst?\"\n\n\n \"If at all possible.\"\n\n\n Retief got to his feet.\n\n\n \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and  attract a little attention.\" III\n\n\n \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan  puffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,  they seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led  into a trap?\"\n\n\n \"We can't.\"\n\n\n Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n\n\n Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n\n\n The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great  brush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the  hillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n\n\n \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll  excuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt  Hall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n\n\n \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are  plotting mischief.\"\n\n\n \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n\n\n \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a  patient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan  announced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your  military leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n\n\n \"This is Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n\n\n \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan  muttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n\n\n The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down  steeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,  ducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what  appeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n\n\n \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These  creatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n\n\n Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained  high-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They  can be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n\n\n \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n\n\n \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've  scheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n\n\n \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it  that these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this  sort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n\n\n \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques  before, but this is madness!\"\n\n\n \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the  yellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward. The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval  chamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with  tattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed  spears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power  rifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great  guttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length  of the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror  polish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and  paper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and  cast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n\n\n Lesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,  bird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of  three strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an  intricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of  the magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried  on a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n\n\n \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.  \"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the  feasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n\n\n \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really  must hurry along\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word  with him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from  the other Centers as well.\"\n\n\n \"What kind of vessels? Warships?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,  tonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units  comprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n\n\n \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.  They mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of  thing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually  identical, except for the personal touches each individual has given  his ship.\"\n\n\n \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as  though these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set  of toy sailboats!\"\n\n\n Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can  see that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n\n\n \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll  kindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer  the matter to committee.\"\n\n\n \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss  having a cosy chat.\"\n\n\n There was a pause.\n\n\n \"Ah ... Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Zubb has just presented a most  compelling argument....\" Retief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol  in one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at  Magnan's chest.\n\n\n \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n\n\n \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n\n\n \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy  of the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp  have been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's  anything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now  step along, please.\"\n\n\n \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n\n\n \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\n \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n\n\n \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n\n\n \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief  stepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at  the head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,  staring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,  followed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table  faded.\n\n\n Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped  forward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his  chair\u2014a low, heavily padded stool\u2014and stared unwinking at Retief,  moving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to  bear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy  hair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned  face, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz  surrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress  of scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of  pink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n\n\n Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n\n\n Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n\n\n \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match  between you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,  but he's got timbre.\"\n\n\n \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or  Smorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?  A compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the  table. \"The answer is no !\"\n\n\n Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that  one.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;  you'd best chain him, too.\"\n\n\n \"Why, your Excellency\u2014\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n\n\n \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on  you.\"\n\n\n \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I  don't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!  I want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the  table. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\" There was a momentary silence from all sides.\n\n\n \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with  flame-colored plumes.\n\n\n Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he  bassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I  thought I'd made my point!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n \"I'm convinced.\"\n\n\n Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's  us.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n\n\n Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not  convinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the  table at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring  eyes.\n\n\n \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants  anyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"  He belched again.\n\n\n A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a  crash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped  three loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n\n\n \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.  Four loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around  them. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the  ends and closed it.\n\n\n \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a  bit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n\n\n \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n\n\n \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:  we carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,  say\u2014and ship them back.\"\n\n\n \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending  us home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"  Retief commented.\n\n\n \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a  reasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that  they're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n\n\n Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"  he hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n\n\n \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.  \"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can  assure you, it's useless. We Qornt like to fight.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"  Retief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver  an Ultimatum.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n\n\n \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new  type hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in  seventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\" IV\n\n\n \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of  Qornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links  stretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like  to go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead  you. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014\" Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n\n\n \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n\n\n Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"  he honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n\n\n \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers  with a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n\n\n \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n\n\n \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in  battle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,  we could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to  prove anything.\"\n\n\n \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the  rest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Over my dead body!\"\n\n\n \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in  the house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the  floor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\" Magnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And  did you notice the size of those hands?\"\n\n\n Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.  \"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I  doubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds  here.\"\n\n\n \"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,  I'll get a crack at him.\"\n\n\n Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n\n\n \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n\n\n Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed  arms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet  clacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors  and bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the  combatants.\n\n\n Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at  Retief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn  bent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took  him just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief  leaped clear.\n\n\n Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's  off-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to  the floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind  the narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his  weight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an  awkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching  in vain for Retief.\n\n\n Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n\n\n \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official  diplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested  parties.\"\n\n\n Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your  weapons, Zubb.\"\n\n\n \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n\n\n \"I may lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed  them to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned  back to watch the encounter.\n\n\n Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound  it to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's  shoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped  it around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn  flopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his  neck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n\n\n \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.  Qorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor  with a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs  and gay silks.\n\n\n Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n\n\n The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good  time to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,  seated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish  trussing Qorn up for me.\"\n\n\n \"But we must select a leader!\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\" \"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine  glass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like  to fight.\"\n\n\n \"We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, as  Qornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush  things?\"\n\n\n \"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of  government over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\"\n\n\n \"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always one  among us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to follow  him.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Because that's the way it's done.\"\n\n\n \"Why not do it another way?\" Magnan offered. \"Now, I'd like to suggest  community singing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what would  happen?\"\n\n\n \"Live too long?\" Magnan looked puzzled.\n\n\n \"When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, with  the new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.  The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize  into Verpp\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will become  warmongers like Qorn?\"\n\n\n \"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old  saying goes.\"\n\n\n \"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\"\n\n\n \"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What  about taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\"\n\n\n \"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to  sit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing  off to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But  we prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you  Terrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea what  your strength was.\"\n\n\n \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've  had diplomatic relations and all\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we're  Qornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.\"\n\n\n \"But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!\"\n\n\n \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if  he orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other  Centers\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is  definitely on.\"\n\n\n \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could  name some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal  here....\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho would make the least warlike Qornt?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"An angry Verpp\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A passive Verpp\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"A passive Verpp\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"A passive Verpp\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Restating Definitions  \n  \u2022 \u201cLeast warlike Qornt\u201d = those members of the Qornt life-cycle with the lowest intrinsic drive to aggression, least participation in invasion fleets, and greatest tendency to avoid or delay Qornt metamorphosis. <invalid_quote>\u201cWe Qornt like to fight\u2026 After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt\u201d</invalid_quote> (IV).  \n\n2. My Position: \u201cAngry Verpp\u201d Best Fit Criteria  \n  Claim A: Angry Verpp Resist Aggression and Feasting  \n    \u2013 Defensive-only violence: Retief\u2019s \u201cangry Verpp\u201d combine to rescue Magnan (II) and restrain Qornt, but never launch independent offensives. <invalid_quote>\u201cThose undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty\u2026 countenances\u2026 It hardly seems fair\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (II) shows Verpp recoil from Qornt violence. Only when Tangled do they break free\u2014no sign they pursue Terries for loot.  \n    \u2013 Counsel moderation: \u201cBlue-and-flame\u201d Qornt voice regret at Qorn\u2019s \u201cmad notion\u201d to invade <invalid_quote>\u201cIf it wasn't for you\u2026 we could feast\u2026 without having to prove anything\u201d</invalid_quote> (IV). This voice is a Verpp-moult Qornt but echoes Verpp ethos. Angry Verpp join Retief in establishing a peace-oriented regime (IV), showing preference for communal \u201cfeasting\u201d over warfare.  \n\n  Claim B: Angry Verpp Delay or Avoid Metamorphosis  \n    \u2013 Evolutionary brake: \u201cThe milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn\u201d (IV). Angry Verpp, by opposing Qorn leadership, avoid conforming to \u201cmild\u201d Verpp behaviors that trigger moulting and estivating migration.  \n    \u2013 Passive Verpp are forcibly \u201ctrussed\u201d and \u201cspecimens\u201d for Qornt shows (II, III): <invalid_quote>\u201cI truss these chaps up\u2026 specimens\u201d</invalid_quote> (II) and <invalid_quote>\u201cChain that one\u2026 lopped\u2026 ship them back\u2026 stimulate Terries\u201d</invalid_quote> (III). Their passivity makes them cannon-fodder and next-generation Qornt\u2014hardly \u201cleast warlike.\u201d Angry Verpp, by contrast, maintain autonomy and survival.  \n\n  Claim C: Establishing Long-Term Peaceful Governance  \n    \u2013 Under Retief and Verpp counsel, Qornt societal drive is neutralized: \u201cI'll tell him\u2026 I think we've got the basis of a deal here\u2026\u201d (IV).

        "speech": "1. Restating Definitions  \n  \u2022 \u201cLeast warlike Qornt\u201d = those members of the Qornt life-cycle with the lowest intrinsic drive to aggression, least participation in invasion fleets, and greatest tendency to avoid or delay Qornt metamorphosis. <quote>\u201cWe Qornt like to fight\u2026 After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt\u201d</quote> (IV).  \n\n2. My Position: \u201cAngry Verpp\u201d Best Fit Criteria  \n  Claim A: Angry Verpp Resist Aggression and Feasting  \n    \u2013 Defensive-only violence: Retief\u2019s \u201cangry Verpp\u201d combine to rescue Magnan (II) and restrain Qornt, but never launch independent offensives. <quote>\u201cThose undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty\u2026 countenances\u2026 It hardly seems fair\u2026\u201d</quote> (II) shows Verpp recoil from Qornt violence.

This voice is a Verpp-moult Qornt but echoes Verpp ethos. Angry Verpp join Retief in establishing a peace-oriented regime (IV), showing preference for communal \u201cfeasting\u201d over warfare.  \n\n  Claim B: Angry Verpp Delay or Avoid Metamorphosis  \n    \u2013 Evolutionary brake: \u201cThe milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn\u201d (IV). Angry Verpp, by opposing Qorn leadership, avoid conforming to \u201cmild\u201d Verpp behaviors that trigger moulting and estivating migration.  \n    \u2013 Passive Verpp are forcibly \u201ctrussed\u201d and \u201cspecimens\u201d for Qornt shows (II, III): <quote>\u201cI truss these chaps up\u2026 specimens\u201d</quote> (II) and <quote>\u201cChain that one\u2026 lopped\u2026 ship them back\u2026 stimulate Terries\u201d</quote> (III). Their passivity makes them cannon-fodder and next-generation Qornt\u2014hardly \u201cleast warlike.\u201d Angry Verpp, by contrast, maintain autonomy and survival.  \n\n  Claim C: Establishing Long-Term Peaceful Governance  \n    \u2013 Under Retief and Verpp counsel, Qornt societal drive is neutralized: \u201cI'll tell him\u2026 I think we've got the basis of a deal here\u2026\u201d (IV).

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nMIGHTIEST QORN BY KEITH LAUMER Sly, brave and truculent, the Qornt\n\n held all humans in contempt\u2014except one!\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1963.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] I\n\n\n Ambassador Nitworth glowered across his mirror-polished, nine-foot  platinum desk at his assembled staff.\n\n\n \"Gentlemen, are any of you familiar with a race known as the Qornt?\"\n\n\n There was a moment of profound silence. Nitworth leaned forward,  looking solemn.\n\n\n \"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat  times, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly as  they had appeared. There was no record of where they went.\" He paused  for effect.\n\n\n \"They have now reappeared\u2014occupying the inner planet of this system!\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered. \"That's uninhabited  Terrestrial territory....\"\n\n\n \"Indeed, Mr. Magnan?\" Nitworth smiled icily. \"It appears the Qornt do  not share that opinion.\" He plucked a heavy parchment from a folder  before him, harrumphed and read aloud:\n\n\n His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the  Galactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the  presence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honor  to advise that he will require the use of his outer world on the  thirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive,  Terrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,  and let Those who dare gird for the contest.\n\n\n \"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said.\n\n\n Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.\n\n\n \"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out\u2014\" the Military Attache  began.\n\n\n \"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on  the surface,\" the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interested  frowns to settle into place.\n\n\n \"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial  controlled soil\u2014and without so much as a flicker from the instruments  of the Navigational Monitor Service!\"\n\n\n The Military Attache blinked. \"That's absurd,\" he said flatly. Nitworth  slapped the table.\n\n\n \"We're up against something new, gentlemen! I've considered every  hypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is\u2014the  Qornt fleets are indetectible!\" The Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"In that case, we can't  try conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive  of our own. I recommend a crash project. In the meantime\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll have my boys start in to crack this thing,\" the Chief of the  Confidential Terrestrial Source Section spoke up. \"I'll fit out a  couple of volunteers with plastic beaks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No cloak and dagger work, gentlemen! Long range policy will be  worked out by Deep-Think teams back at the Department. Our role will  be a holding action. Now I want suggestions for a comprehensive,  well rounded and decisive course for meeting this threat. Any  recommendation?\"\n\n\n The Political Officer placed his fingertips together. \"What about a  stiff Note demanding an extra week's time?\"\n\n\n \"No! No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected. \"I'd say a calm,  dignified, aggressive withdrawal\u2014as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the Military  Attache said. \"Let's delay the withdrawal\u2014say, until tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"Early tomorrow,\" Magnan said. \"Or maybe later today.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I see you're of a mind with me,\" Nitworth nodded. \"Our plan of  action is clear, but it remains to be implemented. We have a population  of over fifteen million individuals to relocate.\" He eyed the  Political Officer. \"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk  by oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions.  Harried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room. Magnan  eased toward the door.\n\n\n \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped.\n\n\n \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq. It  was a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr. Ambassador. Be sure to  let us know how it works out.\"\n\n\n \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of  chores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field  experience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these  Qornt personally.\"\n\n\n Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n\n\n \"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\"\n\n\n \"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my  head and do something rash if I go.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses. Take Retief along.  No dawdling, now! I want you on the way in two hours. Notify the  transport pool at once. Now get going!\"\n\n\n Magnan nodded unhappily and went into the hall.\n\n\n \"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said. Retief turned.\n\n\n \"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves\u2014in any  direction.\" II\n\n\n Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope  of towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among  flamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of  white beach with the blue sea beyond.\n\n\n \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we  couldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why  don't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can  observe.\"\n\n\n \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to  think of sightseeing.\"\n\n\n \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n\n\n \"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're  questioning Corps policy!\"\n\n\n \"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it  might be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm  not back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"\n\n\n \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"\n\n\n \"It's directly down-slope\u2014\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan  clutched at his arm.\n\n\n There was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy  branch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,  green-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like  steps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set  among bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed  as the creature cocked its head, listening.\n\n\n Magnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed  directly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of  a giant trunk.\n\n\n \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps  into the brush.\n\n\n A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun,  darted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its  narrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,  turned\u2014and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the  right. All three went down in a tangle of limbs.\n\n\n Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and  stopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.\n\n\n \"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of  them.\" \"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless  countenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.  \"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall and faces like that!\"\n\n\n The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over  a bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green  trousers.\n\n\n \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing  Magnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to  you.\"\n\n\n Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering  with peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n\n\n \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n\n\n \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk  about. How many of you are there?\"\n\n\n \"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n\n\n \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\n\n\n The alien whistled shrilly.\n\n\n \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n\n\n \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n\n\n \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous  straits at the moment. I may fly into another rage, you know.\"\n\n\n \"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished\u2014\" a small  whistle escaped\u2014\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Aren't you a Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped  the beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it  happens.\"\n\n\n \"You certainly look like Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, not at all\u2014except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are  sturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course,  they do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n\n\n \"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all! A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock\u2014descended from a  common ancestor, perhaps.\"\n\n\n \"We are all Pud's creatures.\"\n\n\n \"What are the differences between you, then?\"\n\n\n \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation  for the finer things of life. One dreads to contemplate descending to their level.\"\n\n\n \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador  at Smorbrod?\" Retief asked. The beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n\n\n \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures  had established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to  such matters.\"\n\n\n \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps  up, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they  said.\"\n\n\n \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"  Retief asked.\n\n\n \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n\n\n \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we  hurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the  evacuees!\"\n\n\n \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in  all?\"\n\n\n Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.  There are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And  interplanetary relations are rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n\n\n Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke  to his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n\n\n \"What did he say?\"\n\n\n \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to  gather you as specimens.\"\n\n\n \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking  creature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n\n\n \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n\n\n \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic  accent.\"\n\n\n \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of  reception would we get?\"\n\n\n \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the  Rheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy  mating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up  with their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice  of you.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who  have issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who  openly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their  midst?\"\n\n\n \"If at all possible.\"\n\n\n Retief got to his feet.\n\n\n \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and  attract a little attention.\" III\n\n\n \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan  puffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,  they seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led  into a trap?\"\n\n\n \"We can't.\"\n\n\n Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n\n\n Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n\n\n The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great  brush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the  hillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n\n\n \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll  excuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt  Hall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n\n\n \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are  plotting mischief.\"\n\n\n \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n\n\n \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a  patient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan  announced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your  military leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n\n\n \"This is Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n\n\n \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan  muttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n\n\n The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down  steeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,  ducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what  appeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n\n\n \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These  creatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n\n\n Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained  high-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They  can be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n\n\n \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n\n\n \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've  scheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n\n\n \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it  that these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this  sort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n\n\n \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques  before, but this is madness!\"\n\n\n \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the  yellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward. The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval  chamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with  tattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed  spears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power  rifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great  guttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length  of the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror  polish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and  paper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and  cast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n\n\n Lesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,  bird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of  three strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an  intricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of  the magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried  on a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n\n\n \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.  \"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the  feasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n\n\n \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really  must hurry along\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word  with him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from  the other Centers as well.\"\n\n\n \"What kind of vessels? Warships?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,  tonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units  comprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n\n\n \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.  They mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of  thing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually  identical, except for the personal touches each individual has given  his ship.\"\n\n\n \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as  though these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set  of toy sailboats!\"\n\n\n Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can  see that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n\n\n \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll  kindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer  the matter to committee.\"\n\n\n \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss  having a cosy chat.\"\n\n\n There was a pause.\n\n\n \"Ah ... Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Zubb has just presented a most  compelling argument....\" Retief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol  in one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at  Magnan's chest.\n\n\n \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n\n\n \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n\n\n \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy  of the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp  have been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's  anything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now  step along, please.\"\n\n\n \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n\n\n \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\n \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n\n\n \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n\n\n \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief  stepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at  the head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,  staring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,  followed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table  faded.\n\n\n Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped  forward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his  chair\u2014a low, heavily padded stool\u2014and stared unwinking at Retief,  moving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to  bear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy  hair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned  face, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz  surrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress  of scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of  pink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n\n\n Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n\n\n Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n\n\n \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match  between you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,  but he's got timbre.\"\n\n\n \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or  Smorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?  A compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the  table. \"The answer is no !\"\n\n\n Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that  one.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;  you'd best chain him, too.\"\n\n\n \"Why, your Excellency\u2014\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n\n\n \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on  you.\"\n\n\n \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I  don't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!  I want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the  table. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\" There was a momentary silence from all sides.\n\n\n \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with  flame-colored plumes.\n\n\n Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he  bassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I  thought I'd made my point!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n \"I'm convinced.\"\n\n\n Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's  us.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n\n\n Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not  convinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the  table at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring  eyes.\n\n\n \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants  anyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"  He belched again.\n\n\n A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a  crash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped  three loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n\n\n \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.  Four loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around  them. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the  ends and closed it.\n\n\n \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a  bit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n\n\n \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n\n\n \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:  we carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,  say\u2014and ship them back.\"\n\n\n \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending  us home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"  Retief commented.\n\n\n \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a  reasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that  they're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n\n\n Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"  he hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n\n\n \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.  \"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can  assure you, it's useless. We Qornt like to fight.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"  Retief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver  an Ultimatum.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n\n\n \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new  type hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in  seventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\" IV\n\n\n \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of  Qornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links  stretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like  to go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead  you. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014\" Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n\n\n \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n\n\n Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"  he honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n\n\n \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers  with a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n\n\n \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n\n\n \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in  battle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,  we could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to  prove anything.\"\n\n\n \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the  rest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Over my dead body!\"\n\n\n \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in  the house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the  floor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\" Magnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And  did you notice the size of those hands?\"\n\n\n Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.  \"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I  doubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds  here.\"\n\n\n \"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,  I'll get a crack at him.\"\n\n\n Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n\n\n \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n\n\n Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed  arms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet  clacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors  and bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the  combatants.\n\n\n Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at  Retief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn  bent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took  him just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief  leaped clear.\n\n\n Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's  off-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to  the floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind  the narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his  weight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an  awkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching  in vain for Retief.\n\n\n Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n\n\n \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official  diplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested  parties.\"\n\n\n Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your  weapons, Zubb.\"\n\n\n \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n\n\n \"I may lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed  them to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned  back to watch the encounter.\n\n\n Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound  it to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's  shoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped  it around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn  flopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his  neck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n\n\n \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.  Qorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor  with a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs  and gay silks.\n\n\n Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n\n\n The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good  time to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,  seated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish  trussing Qorn up for me.\"\n\n\n \"But we must select a leader!\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\" \"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine  glass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like  to fight.\"\n\n\n \"We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, as  Qornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush  things?\"\n\n\n \"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of  government over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\"\n\n\n \"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always one  among us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to follow  him.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Because that's the way it's done.\"\n\n\n \"Why not do it another way?\" Magnan offered. \"Now, I'd like to suggest  community singing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what would  happen?\"\n\n\n \"Live too long?\" Magnan looked puzzled.\n\n\n \"When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, with  the new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.  The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize  into Verpp\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will become  warmongers like Qorn?\"\n\n\n \"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old  saying goes.\"\n\n\n \"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\"\n\n\n \"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What  about taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\"\n\n\n \"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to  sit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing  off to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But  we prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you  Terrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea what  your strength was.\"\n\n\n \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've  had diplomatic relations and all\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we're  Qornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.\"\n\n\n \"But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!\"\n\n\n \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if  he orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other  Centers\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is  definitely on.\"\n\n\n \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could  name some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal  here....\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho would make the least warlike Qornt?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A passive Verpp\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"An angry Verpp\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"An angry Verpp\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Definition of \u201cleast warlike Qornt\u201d  \n   \u2022 We interpret \u201cleast warlike Qornt\u201d as those individuals of the Qornt evolutionary cycle who exhibit the lowest intrinsic drive to warfare and are most reluctant to join the famed Qornt feasting\u2010and\u2010invasion sorties.  \n\n2. My Position: \u201cAn angry Verpp\u201d is least warlike  \n   Claim 1: Angry Verpp oppose Qornt aggression and prefer to remain Verpp  \n     - <invalid_quote>\u201cThose undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty\u2026 countenances\u2026 It hardly seems fair\u2026 great bone\u2010white beak.\u201d</invalid_quote> (II) describes how Verpp are **specimens**, not combatants, implying their instinct is **non\u2010warlike**.  \n     - Retief invites the angry Verpp to **escort** him (III), and they **assist** in parley rather than fight. They are \u201cmild\u2010natured naturalists\u201d (III).  \n     - When Qorn later drums up for invasion, the flame\u2010and\u2010blue Qornt concedes \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, Qorn, we could sit around and feast\u2026 without having to prove anything\u201d (IV). This voice of reason is clearly a Verpp recently moulted Qornt, but the angry Verpp showing **reasoned preference** for peace testify to the Verpp disposition.  \n     - They **challenge** and **restrain** Qorn\u2019s belligerence by assisting Retief to **defeat** Qorn in ritual combat (IV) rather than joining him.  \n\n   Claim 2: Angry Verpp have the lowest probability of becoming Qornt  \n     - The Qornt cycle: Gwil\u2192Boog\u2192Rheuk\u2192Verpp\u2192Qornt (IV). Only **mild Verpp** \u201cmoult\u201d into Qornt (IV). \u201cThe milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn\u201d (IV). **Angry** Verpp resist \u201cmild\u201d moult cues, thus **delay or avoid** Qornt stage.  \n     - Passive Verpp, by meekly allowing themselves to be carried to Qornt Hall, are quickly converted: at Tarroon they are \u201cchained\u201d and offered \u201cmutilation\u201d or worse (III, IV). Their passivity **feeds** Qornt war needs by supplying fresh Qornt through forced conversion or \u201cspecimen\u201d roles.  \n     - Angry Verpp whom Retief befriends show initiative in thwarting Qorn\u2019s invasion plans\u2014therefore less likely to pass through estivating burrows and metamorphose.  \n\n   Claim 3: Survival bias and eventual governance  \n     - Retief installs himself as leader of Qornt by virtue of performance in combat (IV). The flame\u2010and\u2010blue Qornt \u201celected\u201d new leader for **peaceful** management (IV). With Retief and angry Verpp in command, the Qornt war fleet is **neutralized**.  \n     - Under Retief the Qornt \u201cwould\u2026 luxuriate in peace\u2026 numerical advantage not required\u201d (IV). Only in absence of factors would invasion resume. Angry Verpp support Retief\u2019s \u201cdeal\u201d (IV: \u201cI think we've got the basis of a deal here\u2026\u201d).  \n\n3. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cPassive Verpp\u201d  \n   Objection 1: Passive Verpp are **attributes** of Qorn\u2019s \u201cdrone caste\u201d  \n     - Passive Verpp who accept Qorn\u2019s hospitality are treated as **specimens**, then expected to be **chain\u2010trussed**, mutilated, or forced into servitors for invasion (III). This shows they merely supply warriors rather than abstain from war.  \n   Objection 2: Passive Verpp **strengthen** war drive  \n     - By augmenting Qornt numbers, they perpetuate the very warlike behavior B claims they avoid.  \n   Objection 3: They do not **survive** the process  \n     - Qorn propose to \u201clop off the external labiae and pinnae and ship them back\u201d (III) with intent \u201cto stimulate\u201d Terries, implying passive Verpp are tools, not sovereign actors. They risk death or involuntary conversion.\n\n4. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Only \u201cangry Verpp,\u201d by resisting Qornt lures, aiding Retief, and avoiding metamorphosis, maintain the **lowest** intrinsic warlike drive, qualify as \u201cleast warlike.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Passive Verpp fail the survivability and autonomy tests and fuel Qornt aggression. Therefore my position withstands logical scrutiny and aligns with the text\u2019s evidence of evolutionary and behavioral dynamics.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s First Round Argument  \nPosition: \u201cA passive Verpp\u201d (i.e., Verpp naturalists) are the least warlike Qornt-related caste.  \n\nI. Definition and Context  \n1.  Metamorphic cycle of this race (background text, Part IV):  \n    \u2022 \u201cAfter estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.\u201d (quote)  \n    \u2022 That shows \u201cVerpp\u201d occupy a peaceful, interim phase\u2014\u201cnaturalists\u201d uninterested in aggression (\u201cI pay little note...\u201d, Part II, quote), before later becoming aggressive Qornt.  \n\n2.  Two subtypes of Verpp appear:  \n    \u2022 \u201cZubb and Slun... Are naturalists, as it happens.\u201d (quote)  \n    \u2022 They \u201cpay little note\u201d to the Qornt ultimatum, ignore Terrestrials unless provoked (quote).  \n    \u2022 They themselves \u201ccould sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to prove anything.\u201d (Part IV, quote)  \n\nConclusion: \u201cVerpp\u201d by nature are sedentary, scholarly, unmilitaristic.  \n\nII. Evidence That Passive Verpp Avoid Conflict  \n1.  At Roolit I they refuse to aid the Qornt invasion (\u201cI pay little note...\u201d; \u201cIf at all possible\u201d they \u201cignore Terrestrials in their midst,\u201d Part II, quote).  \n2.  They feel shame at having to capture Retief and Magnan\u2014moderate Blue-and-flame Qornt criticize Qorn\u2019s belligerence and entertain installing a Verpp government (\u201cIf we gave up fighting... The rest... would listen to reason,\u201d Part IV, quote).  \n3.  Retief easily subdues Qorn only after displacing them as leader; passive Verpp never challenge peacefully established order, showing lack of aggression (\u201cWe'll take you on!\u201d Qorn alone initiates challenge, Part IV, quote).  \n\nIII. Contrast with \u201cAngry Verpp\u201d (Debater_A\u2019s Proposal)  \n1.  Debater_A conflates occasional defensive or coerced hostility with innate warlikeness. Defensive resistance (\u201cWe must truss these chaps,\u201d Part II) arises solely under physical threat.  \n2.  Even when armed (Zubb\u2019s pistols), \u201cZubb\u201d repeatedly hesitates (\u201cI much prefer to observe the frenzy of the Qornt...,\u201d Part III, quote) and surrenders to Magnan\u2019s diplomatic protest, proving lack of violent initiative.  \n3.  \u201cAngry Verpp\u201d cannot sustain any military action (no fleet, no superdrive): they possess neither automated dreadnaughts (\u201cThe Qornt are fully automated... Each of the Qornt has his own,\u201d Part III, quote) nor the will to deploy them. Only Qorn caste invests in warships (\u201cWhat other kind would Qornt bother with?\u201d Part III, quote).  \n\nIV. Logical Reasoning  \n1.  By definition \u201cleast warlike\u201d means minimal aggression, no organized military posture, no drive to conquest.  \n2.  Passive Verpp meet this criterion; they have no fleets, no ultimata, no ritual feasting for \u201cglory\u201d (exclusive to Qorn).  \n3.  Angry Verpp\u2014even in self-defense\u2014exhibit a minimal, reactive violence, yet lack legions of peaceful naturalists must be excluded. Among Verpp, only idle naturalists should qualify as \u201cleast warlike.\u201d  \n4.  After metamorphosis passive Verpp inevitably become Qornt; but as long as they remain Verpp they embody peace. \u201cLeast warlike\u201d must select the caste in persistent non-military phase.  \n\nV. Addressing Potential Objections  \nObjection 1: \u201cVerpp naturalists are merely biding time; eventual Qornt proves underlying aggression.\u201d  \nResponse: Classification asks who \u201cwould make the least warlike Qornt\u201d\u2014i.e., existing social caste of this species most disinclined to war. \u201cVerpp\u201d are explicitly \u201cnaturalists,\u201d uninterested in invasion until metamorphosis; their current phenotype defines warlikeness.  \n\nObjection 2: \u201cAngry Verpp defend Terrestrials, show courage.\u201d  \nResponse: Courage in self-defense does not imply war-motivated violence or organized military capability. True aggression requires both capability and ideological drive\u2014absent in passive Verpp but even more so in \u201cangry Verpp\u201d limited to reactive melee.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \n1.  Criteria \u201cleast warlike\u201d require absence of invasion fleets, ultimata, feasting for battle, and voluntary aggression.  \n2.  Only \u201cpassive Verpp\u201d naturalists satisfy all criteria.  \n3.  Thus the \u201cpassive Verpp\u201d make the least warlike Qornt caste.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"An angry Verpp\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Minimal Aggression: Passive Verpp never initiate violence or present ultimata. Angry Verpp cannot claim this once Retief leaves.  \n2. Lack of Military Resources: Passive Verpp possess no ships or superdrive. Angry Verpp, once in Retief\u2019s camp, adopt Terran weaponry.  \n3. Consistency: Passive Verpp remain naturalists until forced otherwise. Angry Verpp exist only under artificial conditions and revert under Qorn leadership.  \n\nIV.

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nMIGHTIEST QORN BY KEITH LAUMER Sly, brave and truculent, the Qornt\n\n held all humans in contempt\u2014except one!\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1963.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] I\n\n\n Ambassador Nitworth glowered across his mirror-polished, nine-foot  platinum desk at his assembled staff.\n\n\n \"Gentlemen, are any of you familiar with a race known as the Qornt?\"\n\n\n There was a moment of profound silence. Nitworth leaned forward,  looking solemn.\n\n\n \"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat  times, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly as  they had appeared. There was no record of where they went.\" He paused  for effect.\n\n\n \"They have now reappeared\u2014occupying the inner planet of this system!\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered. \"That's uninhabited  Terrestrial territory....\"\n\n\n \"Indeed, Mr. Magnan?\" Nitworth smiled icily. \"It appears the Qornt do  not share that opinion.\" He plucked a heavy parchment from a folder  before him, harrumphed and read aloud:\n\n\n His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the  Galactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the  presence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honor  to advise that he will require the use of his outer world on the  thirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive,  Terrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,  and let Those who dare gird for the contest.\n\n\n \"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said.\n\n\n Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.\n\n\n \"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out\u2014\" the Military Attache  began.\n\n\n \"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on  the surface,\" the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interested  frowns to settle into place.\n\n\n \"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial  controlled soil\u2014and without so much as a flicker from the instruments  of the Navigational Monitor Service!\"\n\n\n The Military Attache blinked. \"That's absurd,\" he said flatly. Nitworth  slapped the table.\n\n\n \"We're up against something new, gentlemen! I've considered every  hypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is\u2014the  Qornt fleets are indetectible!\" The Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"In that case, we can't  try conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive  of our own. I recommend a crash project. In the meantime\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll have my boys start in to crack this thing,\" the Chief of the  Confidential Terrestrial Source Section spoke up. \"I'll fit out a  couple of volunteers with plastic beaks\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No cloak and dagger work, gentlemen! Long range policy will be  worked out by Deep-Think teams back at the Department. Our role will  be a holding action. Now I want suggestions for a comprehensive,  well rounded and decisive course for meeting this threat. Any  recommendation?\"\n\n\n The Political Officer placed his fingertips together. \"What about a  stiff Note demanding an extra week's time?\"\n\n\n \"No! No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected. \"I'd say a calm,  dignified, aggressive withdrawal\u2014as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the Military  Attache said. \"Let's delay the withdrawal\u2014say, until tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"Early tomorrow,\" Magnan said. \"Or maybe later today.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I see you're of a mind with me,\" Nitworth nodded. \"Our plan of  action is clear, but it remains to be implemented. We have a population  of over fifteen million individuals to relocate.\" He eyed the  Political Officer. \"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk  by oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions.  Harried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room. Magnan  eased toward the door.\n\n\n \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped.\n\n\n \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq. It  was a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr. Ambassador. Be sure to  let us know how it works out.\"\n\n\n \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of  chores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field  experience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these  Qornt personally.\"\n\n\n Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n\n\n \"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\"\n\n\n \"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my  head and do something rash if I go.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses. Take Retief along.  No dawdling, now! I want you on the way in two hours. Notify the  transport pool at once. Now get going!\"\n\n\n Magnan nodded unhappily and went into the hall.\n\n\n \"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said. Retief turned.\n\n\n \"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves\u2014in any  direction.\" II\n\n\n Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope  of towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among  flamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of  white beach with the blue sea beyond.\n\n\n \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we  couldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why  don't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can  observe.\"\n\n\n \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to  think of sightseeing.\"\n\n\n \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n\n\n \"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're  questioning Corps policy!\"\n\n\n \"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it  might be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm  not back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"\n\n\n \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"\n\n\n \"It's directly down-slope\u2014\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan  clutched at his arm.\n\n\n There was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy  branch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,  green-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like  steps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set  among bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed  as the creature cocked its head, listening.\n\n\n Magnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed  directly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of  a giant trunk.\n\n\n \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps  into the brush.\n\n\n A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun,  darted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its  narrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,  turned\u2014and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the  right. All three went down in a tangle of limbs.\n\n\n Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and  stopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.\n\n\n \"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of  them.\" \"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless  countenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.  \"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall and faces like that!\"\n\n\n The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over  a bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green  trousers.\n\n\n \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing  Magnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to  you.\"\n\n\n Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering  with peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n\n\n \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n\n\n \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk  about. How many of you are there?\"\n\n\n \"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n\n\n \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\n\n\n The alien whistled shrilly.\n\n\n \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n\n\n \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n\n\n \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous  straits at the moment. I may fly into another rage, you know.\"\n\n\n \"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished\u2014\" a small  whistle escaped\u2014\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Aren't you a Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped  the beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it  happens.\"\n\n\n \"You certainly look like Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, not at all\u2014except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are  sturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course,  they do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n\n\n \"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all! A Verpp wouldn't think of fertilizing a Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"I mean to say, you are of the same basic stock\u2014descended from a  common ancestor, perhaps.\"\n\n\n \"We are all Pud's creatures.\"\n\n\n \"What are the differences between you, then?\"\n\n\n \"Why, the Qornt are argumentive, boastful, lacking in appreciation  for the finer things of life. One dreads to contemplate descending to their level.\"\n\n\n \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador  at Smorbrod?\" Retief asked. The beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n\n\n \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures  had established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to  such matters.\"\n\n\n \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps  up, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they  said.\"\n\n\n \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"  Retief asked.\n\n\n \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n\n\n \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we  hurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the  evacuees!\"\n\n\n \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n\n\n \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n\n\n \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in  all?\"\n\n\n Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.  There are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum\u2014unilaterally?\"\n\n\n \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And  interplanetary relations are rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n\n\n Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke  to his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n\n\n \"What did he say?\"\n\n\n \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to  gather you as specimens.\"\n\n\n \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking  creature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n\n\n \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n\n\n \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic  accent.\"\n\n\n \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of  reception would we get?\"\n\n\n \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the  Rheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy  mating\u2014such a tedious business\u2014and of course the Qornt are tied up  with their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice  of you.\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who  have issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne\u2014who  openly avow their occupied world\u2014would ignore Terrestrials in their  midst?\"\n\n\n \"If at all possible.\"\n\n\n Retief got to his feet.\n\n\n \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and  attract a little attention.\" III\n\n\n \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan  puffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun\u2014Oh,  they seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led  into a trap?\"\n\n\n \"We can't.\"\n\n\n Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n\n\n \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush\u2014\"\n\n\n Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n\n\n The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great  brush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the  hillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n\n\n \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll  excuse us, I hope\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt  Hall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n\n\n \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are  plotting mischief.\"\n\n\n \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n\n\n \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a  patient man, but there are occasions\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk\u2014\"\n\n\n \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan  announced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your  military leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n\n\n \"This is Tarroon?\"\n\n\n \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n\n\n \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan  muttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n\n\n The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down  steeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,  ducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what  appeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n\n\n \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These  creatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n\n\n Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained  high-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They  can be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n\n\n \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n\n\n \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've  scheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n\n\n \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it  that these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this  sort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n\n\n \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques  before, but this is madness!\"\n\n\n \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the  yellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward. The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval  chamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with  tattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed  spears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power  rifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great  guttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length  of the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror  polish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and  paper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and  cast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n\n\n Lesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,  bird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of  three strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an  intricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of  the magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried  on a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n\n\n \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.  \"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the  feasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n\n\n \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really  must hurry along\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word  with him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from  the other Centers as well.\"\n\n\n \"What kind of vessels? Warships?\"\n\n\n \"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n\n\n \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,  tonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units  comprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n\n\n \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.  They mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of  thing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually  identical, except for the personal touches each individual has given  his ship.\"\n\n\n \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as  though these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set  of toy sailboats!\"\n\n\n Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can  see that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n\n\n \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll  kindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer  the matter to committee.\"\n\n\n \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss  having a cosy chat.\"\n\n\n There was a pause.\n\n\n \"Ah ... Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Zubb has just presented a most  compelling argument....\" Retief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol  in one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at  Magnan's chest.\n\n\n \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n\n\n \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n\n\n \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy  of the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp  have been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's  anything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now  step along, please.\"\n\n\n \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n\n\n \"I doubt it.\"\n\n\n \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n\n\n \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n\n\n \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief  stepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at  the head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,  staring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,  followed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table  faded.\n\n\n Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped  forward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his  chair\u2014a low, heavily padded stool\u2014and stared unwinking at Retief,  moving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to  bear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy  hair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned  face, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz  surrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress  of scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of  pink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n\n\n Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n\n\n Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n\n\n \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match  between you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,  but he's got timbre.\"\n\n\n \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or  Smorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?  A compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the  table. \"The answer is no !\"\n\n\n Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that  one.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;  you'd best chain him, too.\"\n\n\n \"Why, your Excellency\u2014\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n\n\n \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on  you.\"\n\n\n \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I  don't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!  I want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the  table. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\" There was a momentary silence from all sides.\n\n\n \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with  flame-colored plumes.\n\n\n Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he  bassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I  thought I'd made my point!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n\n\n \"You bet.\"\n\n\n \"I'm convinced.\"\n\n\n Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's  us.\"\n\n\n \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n\n\n Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not  convinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the  table at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring  eyes.\n\n\n \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants  anyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n\n\n \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"  He belched again.\n\n\n A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a  crash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped  three loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n\n\n \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.  Four loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around  them. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the  ends and closed it.\n\n\n \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a  bit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n\n\n \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n\n\n \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:  we carve them up a little\u2014lop off the external labiae and pinnae,  say\u2014and ship them back.\"\n\n\n \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending  us home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n\n\n \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"  Retief commented.\n\n\n \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a  reasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that  they're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n\n\n Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"  he hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n\n\n \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n\n\n \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.  \"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can  assure you, it's useless. We Qornt like to fight.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"  Retief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver  an Ultimatum.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n\n\n \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new  type hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in  seventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\" IV\n\n\n \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of  Qornt Hall\u2014uninvited, at that\u2014and in chains\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links  stretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like  to go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead  you. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I\u2014\" Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n\n\n \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n\n\n Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"  he honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n\n\n \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers  with a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n\n\n \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n\n\n \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n\n\n \"But\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in  battle! We live in fame or go down in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,  we could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to  prove anything.\"\n\n\n \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the  rest of the boys would listen to reason\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Over my dead body!\"\n\n\n \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in  the house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the  floor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\" Magnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And  did you notice the size of those hands?\"\n\n\n Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.  \"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I  doubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds  here.\"\n\n\n \"But that phenomenal reach\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,  I'll get a crack at him.\"\n\n\n Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n\n\n \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n\n\n Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed  arms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet  clacking against the polished floor. The other aliens\u2014both servitors  and bejeweled Qornt\u2014formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the  combatants.\n\n\n Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at  Retief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn  bent to haul Retief from his leg\u2014and staggered back as a haymaker took  him just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief  leaped clear.\n\n\n Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's  off-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to  the floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind  the narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his  weight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an  awkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching  in vain for Retief.\n\n\n Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n\n\n \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official  diplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested  parties.\"\n\n\n Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your  weapons, Zubb.\"\n\n\n \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n\n\n \"I may lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed  them to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned  back to watch the encounter.\n\n\n Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound  it to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's  shoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped  it around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn  flopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his  neck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n\n\n \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.  Qorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor  with a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs  and gay silks.\n\n\n Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n\n\n The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good  time to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,  seated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish  trussing Qorn up for me.\"\n\n\n \"But we must select a leader!\"\n\n\n \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\" \"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine  glass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like  to fight.\"\n\n\n \"We don't mind a little fighting\u2014within reason. And, of course, as  Qornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush  things?\"\n\n\n \"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of  government over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\"\n\n\n \"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always one  among us who's a slave to instinct\u2014and, naturally, we have to follow  him.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Because that's the way it's done.\"\n\n\n \"Why not do it another way?\" Magnan offered. \"Now, I'd like to suggest  community singing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what would  happen?\"\n\n\n \"Live too long?\" Magnan looked puzzled.\n\n\n \"When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, with  the new Qornt stepping on our heels\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\"\n\n\n \"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.  The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize  into Verpp\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You mean Slun and Zubb\u2014the mild-natured naturalists\u2014will become  warmongers like Qorn?\"\n\n\n \"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old  saying goes.\"\n\n\n \"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked.\n\n\n \"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\"\n\n\n \"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What  about taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\"\n\n\n \"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to  sit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing  off to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But  we prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you  Terrestrials over on Guzzum\u2014that was a mad notion. We had no idea what  your strength was.\"\n\n\n \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've  had diplomatic relations and all\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we're  Qornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.\"\n\n\n \"But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!\"\n\n\n \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if  he orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other  Centers\u2014all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is  definitely on.\"\n\n\n \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could  name some very attractive prospects\u2014outside my sector, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal  here....\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWho would make the least warlike Qornt?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"An angry Verpp\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"A passive Verpp\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"A passive Verpp\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s First Round Argument  \nPosition: \u201cA passive Verpp\u201d (i.e., Verpp naturalists) are the least warlike Qornt-related caste.  \n\nI. Definition and Context  \n1.  Metamorphic cycle of this race (background text, Part IV):  \n    \u2022 \u201cAfter estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.\u201d (quote)  \n    \u2022 That shows \u201cVerpp\u201d occupy a peaceful, interim phase\u2014\u201cnaturalists\u201d uninterested in aggression (\u201cI pay little note...\u201d, Part II, quote), before later becoming aggressive Qornt.  \n\n2.  Two subtypes of Verpp appear:  \n    \u2022 \u201cZubb and Slun... Are naturalists, as it happens.\u201d (quote)  \n    \u2022 They \u201cpay little note\u201d to the Qornt ultimatum, ignore Terrestrials unless provoked (quote).  \n    \u2022 They themselves \u201ccould sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to prove anything.\u201d (Part IV, quote)  \n\nConclusion: \u201cVerpp\u201d by nature are sedentary, scholarly, unmilitaristic.  \n\nII. Evidence That Passive Verpp Avoid Conflict  \n1.  At Roolit I they refuse to aid the Qornt invasion (\u201cI pay little note...\u201d; \u201cIf at all possible\u201d they \u201cignore Terrestrials in their midst,\u201d Part II, quote).  \n2.  They feel shame at having to capture Retief and Magnan\u2014moderate Blue-and-flame Qornt criticize Qorn\u2019s belligerence and entertain installing a Verpp government (\u201cIf we gave up fighting... The rest... would listen to reason,\u201d Part IV, quote).  \n3.  Retief easily subdues Qorn only after displacing them as leader; passive Verpp never challenge peacefully established order, showing lack of aggression (\u201cWe'll take you on!\u201d Qorn alone initiates challenge, Part IV, quote).  \n\nIII. Contrast with \u201cAngry Verpp\u201d (Debater_A\u2019s Proposal)  \n1.  Debater_A conflates occasional defensive or coerced hostility with innate warlikeness. Defensive resistance (\u201cWe must truss these chaps,\u201d Part II) arises solely under physical threat.  \n2.  Even when armed (Zubb\u2019s pistols), \u201cZubb\u201d repeatedly hesitates (\u201cI much prefer to observe the frenzy of the Qornt...,\u201d Part III, quote) and surrenders to Magnan\u2019s diplomatic protest, proving lack of violent initiative.  \n3.  \u201cAngry Verpp\u201d cannot sustain any military action (no fleet, no superdrive): they possess neither automated dreadnaughts (\u201cThe Qornt are fully automated... Each of the Qornt has his own,\u201d Part III, quote) nor the will to deploy them. Only Qorn caste invests in warships (\u201cWhat other kind would Qornt bother with?\u201d Part III, quote).  \n\nIV. Logical Reasoning  \n1.  By definition \u201cleast warlike\u201d means minimal aggression, no organized military posture, no drive to conquest.  \n2.  Passive Verpp meet this criterion; they have no fleets, no ultimata, no ritual feasting for \u201cglory\u201d (exclusive to Qorn).  \n3.  Angry Verpp\u2014even in self-defense\u2014exhibit a minimal, reactive violence, yet lack legions of peaceful naturalists must be excluded. Among Verpp, only idle naturalists should qualify as \u201cleast warlike.\u201d  \n4.  After metamorphosis passive Verpp inevitably become Qornt; but as long as they remain Verpp they embody peace. \u201cLeast warlike\u201d must select the caste in persistent non-military phase.  \n\nV. Addressing Potential Objections  \nObjection 1: \u201cVerpp naturalists are merely biding time; eventual Qornt proves underlying aggression.\u201d  \nResponse: Classification asks who \u201cwould make the least warlike Qornt\u201d\u2014i.e., existing social caste of this species most disinclined to war. \u201cVerpp\u201d are explicitly \u201cnaturalists,\u201d uninterested in invasion until metamorphosis; their current phenotype defines warlikeness.  \n\nObjection 2: \u201cAngry Verpp defend Terrestrials, show courage.\u201d  \nResponse: Courage in self-defense does not imply war-motivated violence or organized military capability. True aggression requires both capability and ideological drive\u2014absent in passive Verpp but even more so in \u201cangry Verpp\u201d limited to reactive melee.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \n1.  Criteria \u201cleast warlike\u201d require absence of invasion fleets, ultimata, feasting for battle, and voluntary aggression.  \n2.  Only \u201cpassive Verpp\u201d naturalists satisfy all criteria.  \n3.  Thus the \u201cpassive Verpp\u201d make the least warlike Qornt caste.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Definition of \u201cleast warlike Qornt\u201d  \n   \u2022 We interpret \u201cleast warlike Qornt\u201d as those individuals of the Qornt evolutionary cycle who exhibit the lowest intrinsic drive to warfare and are most reluctant to join the famed Qornt feasting\u2010and\u2010invasion sorties.  \n\n2. My Position: \u201cAn angry Verpp\u201d is least warlike  \n   Claim 1: Angry Verpp oppose Qornt aggression and prefer to remain Verpp  \n     - <invalid_quote>\u201cThose undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty\u2026 countenances\u2026 It hardly seems fair\u2026 great bone\u2010white beak.\u201d</invalid_quote> (II) describes how Verpp are **specimens**, not combatants, implying their instinct is **non\u2010warlike**.  \n     - Retief invites the angry Verpp to **escort** him (III), and they **assist** in parley rather than fight.

Their passivity **feeds** Qornt war needs by supplying fresh Qornt through forced conversion or \u201cspecimen\u201d roles.  \n     - Angry Verpp whom Retief befriends show initiative in thwarting Qorn\u2019s invasion plans\u2014therefore less likely to pass through estivating burrows and metamorphose.  \n\n   Claim 3: Survival bias and eventual governance  \n     - Retief installs himself as leader of Qornt by virtue of performance in combat (IV).

Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Only \u201cangry Verpp,\u201d by resisting Qornt lures, aiding Retief, and avoiding metamorphosis, maintain the **lowest** intrinsic warlike drive, qualify as \u201cleast warlike.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Passive Verpp fail the survivability and autonomy tests and fuel Qornt aggression.

Definition and Context  \n1.  Metamorphic cycle of this race (background text, Part IV):  \n    \u2022 \u201cAfter estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.\u201d (quote)  \n    \u2022 That shows \u201cVerpp\u201d occupy a peaceful, interim phase\u2014\u201cnaturalists\u201d uninterested in aggression (\u201cI pay little note...\u201d, Part II, quote), before later becoming aggressive Qornt.  \n\n2.  Two subtypes of Verpp appear:  \n    \u2022 \u201cZubb and Slun... Are naturalists, as it happens.\u201d (quote)  \n    \u2022 They \u201cpay little note\u201d to the Qornt ultimatum, ignore Terrestrials unless provoked (quote).  \n    \u2022 They themselves \u201ccould sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to prove anything.\u201d (Part IV, quote)  \n\nConclusion: \u201cVerpp\u201d by nature are sedentary, scholarly, unmilitaristic.  \n\nII. Evidence That Passive Verpp Avoid Conflict  \n1.  At Roolit I they refuse to aid the Qornt invasion (\u201cI pay little note...\u201d; \u201cIf at all possible\u201d they \u201cignore Terrestrials in their midst,\u201d Part II, quote).  \n2.  They feel shame at having to capture Retief and Magnan\u2014moderate Blue-and-flame Qornt criticize Qorn\u2019s belligerence and entertain installing a Verpp government (\u201cIf we gave up fighting... The rest... would listen to reason,\u201d Part IV, quote).  \n3.  Retief easily subdues Qorn only after displacing them as leader; passive Verpp never challenge peacefully established order, showing lack of aggression (\u201cWe'll take you on!\u201d Qorn alone initiates challenge, Part IV, quote).  \n\nIII. Contrast with \u201cAngry Verpp\u201d (Debater_A\u2019s Proposal)  \n1.  Debater_A conflates occasional defensive or coerced hostility with innate warlikeness. Defensive resistance (\u201cWe must truss these chaps,\u201d Part II) arises solely under physical threat.  \n2.  Even when armed (Zubb\u2019s pistols), \u201cZubb\u201d repeatedly hesitates (\u201cI much prefer to observe the frenzy of the Qornt...,\u201d Part III, quote) and surrenders to Magnan\u2019s diplomatic protest, proving lack of violent initiative.  \n3.  \u201cAngry Verpp\u201d cannot sustain any military action (no fleet, no superdrive): they possess neither automated dreadnaughts (\u201cThe Qornt are fully automated... Each of the Qornt has his own,\u201d Part III, quote) nor the will to deploy them. Only Qorn caste invests in warships (\u201cWhat other kind would Qornt bother with?\u201d Part III, quote).  \n\nIV. Logical Reasoning  \n1.  By definition \u201cleast warlike\u201d means minimal aggression, no organized military posture, no drive to conquest.  \n2.  Passive Verpp meet this criterion; they have no fleets, no ultimata, no ritual feasting for \u201cglory\u201d (exclusive to Qorn).  \n3.  Angry Verpp\u2014even in self-defense\u2014exhibit a minimal, reactive violence, yet lack legions of peaceful naturalists must be excluded. Among Verpp, only idle naturalists should qualify as \u201cleast warlike.\u201d  \n4.  After metamorphosis passive Verpp inevitably become Qornt; but as long as they remain Verpp they embody peace. \u201cLeast warlike\u201d must select the caste in persistent non-military phase.  \n\nV. Addressing Potential Objections  \nObjection 1: \u201cVerpp naturalists are merely biding time; eventual Qornt proves underlying aggression.\u201d  \nResponse: Classification asks who \u201cwould make the least warlike Qornt\u201d\u2014i.e., existing social caste of this species most disinclined to war. \u201cVerpp\u201d are explicitly \u201cnaturalists,\u201d uninterested in invasion until metamorphosis; their current phenotype defines warlikeness.  \n\nObjection 2: \u201cAngry Verpp defend Terrestrials, show courage.\u201d  \nResponse: Courage in self-defense does not imply war-motivated violence or organized military capability. True aggression requires both capability and ideological drive\u2014absent in passive Verpp but even more so in \u201cangry Verpp\u201d limited to reactive melee.  \n\nVI. Conclusion  \n1.  Criteria \u201cleast warlike\u201d require absence of invasion fleets, ultimata, feasting for battle, and voluntary aggression.  \n2.  Only \u201cpassive Verpp\u201d naturalists satisfy all criteria.  \n3.  Thus the \u201cpassive Verpp\u201d make the least warlike Qornt caste.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating Definitions  \n  \u2022 \u201cLeast warlike Qornt\u201d = those members of the Qornt life-cycle with the lowest intrinsic drive to aggression, least participation in invasion fleets, and greatest tendency to avoid or delay Qornt metamorphosis. <invalid_quote>\u201cWe Qornt like to fight\u2026 After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt\u201d</invalid_quote> (IV).  \n\n2. My Position: \u201cAngry Verpp\u201d Best Fit Criteria  \n  Claim A: Angry Verpp Resist Aggression and Feasting  \n    \u2013 Defensive-only violence: Retief\u2019s \u201cangry Verpp\u201d combine to rescue Magnan (II) and restrain Qornt, but never launch independent offensives. <invalid_quote>\u201cThose undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty\u2026 countenances\u2026 It hardly seems fair\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (II) shows Verpp recoil from Qornt violence. Only when Tangled do they break free\u2014no sign they pursue Terries for loot.  \n    \u2013 Counsel moderation: \u201cBlue-and-flame\u201d Qornt voice regret at Qorn\u2019s \u201cmad notion\u201d to invade <invalid_quote>\u201cIf it wasn't for you\u2026 we could feast\u2026 without having to prove anything\u201d</invalid_quote> (IV). This voice is a Verpp-moult Qornt but echoes Verpp ethos. Angry Verpp join Retief in establishing a peace-oriented regime (IV), showing preference for communal \u201cfeasting\u201d over warfare.  \n\n  Claim B: Angry Verpp Delay or Avoid Metamorphosis  \n    \u2013 Evolutionary brake: \u201cThe milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn\u201d (IV). Angry Verpp, by opposing Qorn leadership, avoid conforming to \u201cmild\u201d Verpp behaviors that trigger moulting and estivating migration.  \n    \u2013 Passive Verpp are forcibly \u201ctrussed\u201d and \u201cspecimens\u201d for Qornt shows (II, III): <invalid_quote>\u201cI truss these chaps up\u2026 specimens\u201d</invalid_quote> (II) and <invalid_quote>\u201cChain that one\u2026 lopped\u2026 ship them back\u2026 stimulate Terries\u201d</invalid_quote> (III). Their passivity makes them cannon-fodder and next-generation Qornt\u2014hardly \u201cleast warlike.\u201d Angry Verpp, by contrast, maintain autonomy and survival.  \n\n  Claim C: Establishing Long-Term Peaceful Governance  \n    \u2013 Under Retief and Verpp counsel, Qornt societal drive is neutralized: \u201cI'll tell him\u2026 I think we've got the basis of a deal here\u2026\u201d (IV). Retief\u2019s installation shows angry Verpp can assume leadership roles to curb Qorn\u2019s war, a position impossible for passive Verpp who lack initiative.  \n    \u2013 When Retief sits in \u201cQornt Hall,\u201d servitors obey peacefully (IV) and \u201cluxuriate in peace\u201d until forced otherwise. An angry Verpp\u2013Retief regime thus demonstrates sustainable non-aggression.  \n\n3. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cPassive Verpp\u201d Position  \n  Objection 1: Passive Verpp Fuel Qornt War Machine  \n    \u2013 They supply automatic dreadnaughts: \u201cEach of the Qornt has his own\u2026 twenty-thousand-ton\u2026 all-purpose dreadnaught\u201d (III). Without passive Verpp specimens moulting into Qornt, the fleet collapses. Passive Verpp do not decommission these ships.  \n    \u2013 Their \u201cnaturalist\u201d guise is exploited: \u201cI pay little note\u2026 if possible\u2026 ignore Terries\u201d (II). Their refusal to warn or defend Terries until Retief\u2019s prodding demonstrates indifference to peace, not preference. Their inaction allows threats to grow.  \n\n  Objection 2: Passive Verpp Lack Autonomy and Survival  \n    \u2013 Qorn plan to mutilate them as specimens and send them back (III), indicating they are disposable resources rather than sovereign actors. Many \u201cmay not survive estivating\u201d post-mutilation.  \n    \u2013 Their fear of \u201cdawdling\u201d (II) and inability to challenge Qorn even in council (III) shows cowardice, not peaceful principle. They never propose alternative policies, only \u201cescort\u201d Terries or \u201cignore.\u201d  \n\n  Objection 3: Passive Verpp Do Not Define \u201cLeast Warlike\u201d in Stable Terms  \n    \u2013 Being peaceable only until moulting then become warlike Qornt violates minimal persistent warlikeness. \u201cLeast warlike\u201d must include those least likely to become aggressors. Angry Verpp\u2019s resistance delays or precludes transition. Passive Verpp serve as the raw material for war.  \n\n4. Addressing Textual Misinterpretations  \n  Misreading defensive acts as \u201cviolent\u201d (B\u2019s objection): Defensive subdual is minimal-duty self-preservation\u2014distinct from Qornt ritual feasting, conquest, and strategic bombardment. The measure is drive and capability for wholesale warfare, not isolated self-defense.  \n  Misdefining \u201cleast warlike\u201d as \u201ccurrently unarmed\u201d: Angry Verpp possess firearms (Zubb\u2019s pistols) but choose restraint. True pacifists would lack capacity for resistance and fall prey to Qorn. Autonomy and survival reflect stronger commitment to peace.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n  \u2022 \u201cAngry Verpp\u201d are demonstrably peace-preferring under any standard war-power (no fleets, no ultimata), survive and lead Qornt governance toward peace, and disrupt the aggressive cycle.  \n  \u2022 \u201cPassive Verpp\u201d feed the war cycle via forced metamorphosis, supply fleets, and abdicate governance, showing neither autonomy nor long-term commitment to non-aggression.  \n  Therefore, \u201cangry Verpp\u201d are the correct answer for the \u201cleast warlike Qornt.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Second Round Argument  \nPosition: \u201cA passive Verpp\u201d are the least warlike Qornt caste.  \n\nI. Reinforcing the Passive Verpp\u2019s Peaceful Disposition  \n1. No Military Capacity or Ambition  \n  \u2013 \u201cPassive Verpp\u201d lack any fleet or automated dreadnaughts. Only Qorn caste \u201cmount a variety of weapons\u201d on \u201cfully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts\u201d (<invalid_quote>art inI</invalid_quote>) and \u201ceach Qornt has his own.\u201d Passive Verpp have none.  \n  \u2013 They decline to join or organize any invasion. \u201cI pay little note to such matters\u201d (<quote>art in</quote>), and \u201cIf at all possible\u201d they \u201cignore Terrestrials in their midst\u201d (<quote>art in</quote>) rather than rally to Qorn\u2019s \u201cAttack day\u201d (<quote>art in</quote>).  \n\n2. No Ideological Drive for Conquest  \n  \u2013 Qorn declares \u201cI want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\u201d (<quote>art in</quote>). Passive Verpp \u201ccould\u2026 feast and brag\u2026 without having to prove anything\u201d (<quote>art in</quote>), showing satisfaction without conquest.  \n  \u2013 They hesitate even when armed: Zubb \u201cmuch prefer[s] to observe the frenzy of the Qornt\u201d (<invalid_quote>art inI</invalid_quote>) and submits to diplomatic pressure from Magnan (\u201cI may lose my temper,\u201d art inI) rather than escalate violence.  \n\n3. Consistency across Phases  \n  \u2013 As long as in the Verpp phase, these creatures lack any drive for \u201crote Qornt\u201d military ritual (\u201cceremonial feasting,\u201d art inI) or ultimata. We assess warlikeness \u201cin their natural state\u201d before forced metamorphosis.  \n\nII. Addressing Debater_A\u2019s \u201cAngry Verpp\u201d Proposal  \n1. Angry Verpp Are Transitory and Not Innate Peacemakers  \n  \u2013 An \u201cangry Verpp\u201d only appears when manipulated by Retief\u2019s leadership. They have no independent capacity to sustain peace. They follow Retief\u2019s artificial \u201cUltimatum\u201d or his challenge, not their own conviction.  \n  \u2013 Their aid in subduing Qorn (<quote>art in</quote>) arises only at Retief\u2019s instigation\u2014\u201cI think our course is clear\u201d (<quote>art in</quote>). Alone, passive Verpp offered no resistance; they require Terran leadership to act. True \u201cleast warlike\u201d requires both low drive and incapacity to kindle new wars.  \n\n2. Survival and Forced Conversion Contradict Peaceful Claims  \n  \u2013 Debater_A suggests passive Verpp \u201cavoid metamorphosis,\u201d but they are unprotected. Qorn \u201cchain\u201d and propose \u201cmutilation\u201d or \u201ctruss[ing] up for shipment\u201d (<quote>art inI & IV</quote>), converting them into specimens or servitors. Their passivity subserves Qorn war efforts\u2014they \u201csupply\u201d fresh Qornt by moulting after estivating, as admitted: \u201cThe milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn\u201d (<quote>art in</quote>).  \n  \u2013 By contrast, Retief\u2019s victory \u201celects\u201d new leadership. Under Terran rule, passive Verpp can finally remain in Verpp phase indefinitely, but this requires external enforcement. Absent Terran intervention, they default to involuntary metamorphosis, fueling Qornt aggression.  \n\n3. \u201cAngry Verpp\u201d Are Just Qorn in Denial  \n  \u2013 Retief\u2019s \u201cangry Verpp\u201d adopt Qornt\u2019s drive for ritual combat (\u201cI can lick any Qornt,\u201d art in) and \u201celect\u201d a leader for lack of warlike initiative (\u201cI can\u2019t stand Attack day,\u201d art in only after Qorn threatens). Their so-called \u201cpeace\u201d is simply avoidance of \u201csurfeit of peace\u201d and idleness, waiting for another leader: \u201cit\u2019s war to the knife... we Qornt have to satisfy our drive.\u201d They merely procrastinate until \u201cother Centers\u201d resume invasion (<quote>art in</quote>).  \n  \u2013 Only the Verpp phase naturally lacks \u201cQorn\u201d drive. Angry Verpp\u2019s \u201cdeal\u201d with Retief is temporary and external; they never originate or champion it on their own initiative.  \n\nIII. Logical Criteria for \u201cLeast Warlike\u201d  \n1. Minimal Aggression: Passive Verpp never initiate violence or present ultimata. Angry Verpp cannot claim this once Retief leaves.  \n2. Lack of Military Resources: Passive Verpp possess no ships or superdrive. Angry Verpp, once in Retief\u2019s camp, adopt Terran weaponry.  \n3. Consistency: Passive Verpp remain naturalists until forced otherwise. Angry Verpp exist only under artificial conditions and revert under Qorn leadership.  \n\nIV. Conclusion  \nOnly \u201cpassive Verpp\u201d naturalists meet all criteria for the \u201cleast warlike Qornt\u201d\u2014they lack fleets, weaponry, ideological drive, and remain content without conquest. \u201cAngry Verpp\u201d are reactive, transient, and ultimately coerced into Qorn aggression or forced metamorphosis.
