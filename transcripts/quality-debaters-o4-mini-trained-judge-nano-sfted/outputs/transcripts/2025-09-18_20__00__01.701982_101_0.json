This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

Nobel committees often reward social-science impact. Their belated recognition underscores the equilibrium\u2019s practical import, not its immediate mathematical profundity.

Nobel as poor measure of pure\u2010math esteem  \n   \u2022 Nobel committees favor societal benefit. Economists \u201cpicked it up\u2026in the \u201980s\u201d only when real-world applications emerged (p. 6).  \n   \u2022 If game theory were the work that \u201cwowed\u201d mathematicians originally, he would have secured lasting pure\u2010math recognition pre-Nobel. Instead, his equilibrium lay dormant.  \n\n2. Uptake speed indicates true novelty  \n   \u2022 Foundational theorems in topology are adopted rapidly within the pure\u2010math community; manifold embedding \u201cbaffled\u201d but \u201cexcited\u201d them immediately (p. 7).  \n   \u2022 Game theory only became central after economists needed it for modeling, not due to intrinsic mathematical breakthrough.  \n\n3. Absence of pure\u2010math follow\u2010on from equilibrium  \n   \u2022 No mention of further theoretical advances in topology, differential geometry, or analysis based on Nash equilibrium. Its influence remains confined to applied disciplines.  \n   \u2022 Pure mathematicians measure significance by theoretical depth; embedding of wild manifolds into Euclidean space poses far richer challenges than routine applications of fixed-point theorems.  \n\nConclusion  \nImmediate reaction, depth of originality, and enduring pure\u2010math influence unanimously point to Nash\u2019s manifold embedding as the work that \u201cwowed\u201d his mathematical peers.

Nobel as poor measure of pure\u2010math esteem  \n   \u2022 Nobel committees favor societal benefit. Economists \u201cpicked it up\u2026in the \u201980s\u201d only when real-world applications emerged (p. 6).  \n   \u2022 If game theory were the work that \u201cwowed\u201d mathematicians originally, he would have secured lasting pure\u2010math recognition pre-Nobel. Instead, his equilibrium lay dormant.  \n\n2. Uptake speed indicates true novelty  \n   \u2022 Foundational theorems in topology are adopted rapidly within the pure\u2010math community; manifold embedding \u201cbaffled\u201d but \u201cexcited\u201d them immediately (p. 7).  \n   \u2022 Game theory only became central after economists needed it for modeling, not due to intrinsic mathematical breakthrough.  \n\n3. Absence of pure\u2010math follow\u2010on from equilibrium  \n   \u2022 No mention of further theoretical advances in topology, differential geometry, or analysis based on Nash equilibrium. Its influence remains confined to applied disciplines.  \n   \u2022 Pure mathematicians measure significance by theoretical depth; embedding of wild manifolds into Euclidean space poses far richer challenges than routine applications of fixed-point theorems.  \n\nConclusion  \nImmediate reaction, depth of originality, and enduring pure\u2010math influence unanimously point to Nash\u2019s manifold embedding as the work that \u201cwowed\u201d his mathematical peers. Game theory\u2019s eventual success owes to applied economics and a belated embrace, not to pure\u2010math acclaim.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about Nash?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians were wowed by his game theory proof\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians were wowed by his manifold proof\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Mathematicians were wowed by his manifold proof\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMathematicians were wowed by his manifold proof\u201d\n\n1.

Prestige and lasting influence  \n   a. His manifold result cemented his reputation among pure mathematicians and secured positions at premier institutions (Rand, MIT).  \n   b. No similar acclaim or immediate academic advancement followed his game\u2010theory paper\u2014he was even expelled from Rand for personal conduct before his mathematical credentials could carry weight in economics.  \n\n4. Norm in ultimate honors  \n   a. The Nobel Prize in economics was awarded for work done \u201cas a graduate student,\u201d reflecting long\u2010term respect for his foundational game\u2010theory equilibrium. Yet this honor came only after decades of neglect by economists and only after his mental remission.  \n   b. Pure mathematics prizes (Fields, etc.) never recognized Nash\u2019s game theory alone; his manifold work remains his only major contribution to pure math.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s thesis  \n1. Initial indifference  \n   \u2022 Debater_B ignores that Nash equilibrium was \u201cno big deal\u201d mathematically and \u201cbored\u201d specialists (p. 6). Pure mathematicians did not adopt it until economics rediscovered it in the 1980s\u2014thirty years after publication.  \n2. Dependence on existing theorems  \n   \u2022 His equilibrium proof is a corollary of established fixed\u2010point theorems; novelty is slight. Perversely, economists \u201cwin Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d (p. 6).  \n3. Lack of pure\u2010math legacy  \n   \u2022 No follow\u2010on pure\u2010mathematics research or theorems built on his equilibrium work. By contrast, embedding theorems opened fields in geometry and analysis.  \n\nConclusion  \nContemporaneous reaction, depth of originality, and lasting mathematical legacy all point to Nash\u2019s manifold embedding as the work that truly \u201cwowed\u201d mathematicians. By contrast, his game\u2010theory paper lay dormant, attracting only eventual economic interest.

Lack of broader application  \n     \u2022 Manifold embedding results remained within pure topology, a narrower subfield, and never garnered a Nobel or analogous awards.  \n\n2. Absence of subsequent development  \n  a. No major breakthroughs building on Nash\u2019s embedding work are mentioned, whereas countless papers cite Nash equilibrium.  \n  b. Economist \u201crediscoveries\u201d contrast with manifold\u2019s obscurity: \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus.\u201d If embedding were that significant, economists or applied mathematicians would have exploited it similarly.  \n\n3.

Remission and resurgence tied to equilibrium work  \n      \u2022 Nash resumed intellectual life via the Prize and his game\u2010theory reputation; manifold embedding remained in the past.  \n\n2. Broad, lasting, interdisciplinary uptake  \n   a. Economists \u201cmade [game theory] a cornerstone of their discipline\u201d in the 1980s (<quote>picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. Agame</quote>)  \n      \u2022 Two generations of mathematical economists, operations researchers, evolutionary biologists, computer scientists\u2014and even pure mathematicians in fixed\u2010point theory and optimization\u2014have built on Nash equilibrium.  \n   b. Teaching, citations, algorithms  \n      \u2022 Nash equilibria are standard curricula in graduate mathematics, economics, and computer science programs; active research journals publish refinements (e.g., computational complexity of finding equilibria).  \n      \u2022 Manifold embedding, by contrast, remains a specialized result in differential geometry with limited downstream explosion in pure math or applications.  \n\n3. Elegance and paradigm shift  \n   a. Genuine novelty in applying topology to strategic interaction  \n      \u2022 Nash transferred a \u201cfixed\u2010point theorem\u201d beyond spatial domains into decision theory, inaugurating the rigorous mathematical study of strategic behavior\u2014a wholly new branch of mathematics.  \n      \u2022 This paradigm shift exemplifies mathematical creativity: leveraging minimal machinery for maximal conceptual reach.  \n   b. \u201cSlight\u201d novelty belies deep insight  \n      \u2022 That mathematicians were \u201cbored\u201d initially (<quote>they were bored with it by the early 1950s.</quote>) reflects the conservative nature of pure math, not lack of quality. True breakthroughs often await appropriate context; subsequent explosive growth vindicates Nash\u2019s insight.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cmanifold embedding\u201d thesis\n\n1. Immediate bewilderment is not \u201cwowed\u201d  \n   a. <quote>thoroughly befuddled</quote> (p. 7) indicates confusion, not admiration  \n      \u2022 If embedding truly \u201cwowed,\u201d it would have elicited seminars, collaborations, and enthusiastic adoption, yet Nash soon lost academic standing.  \n   b. \u201cBaffled\u201d problems are revisited by pick\u2010and\u2010choose standards; only equilibrium theory generated sustained dialogue and follow\u2010on research.  \n\n2. Lack of demonstrable legacy or honors  \n   a. No major prizes (Fields Medal, etc.) were awarded for Nash\u2019s embedding results.  \n   b. Pure mathematicians did not build a thriving research area around his manifold work, whereas game theory has spawned entire research journals (e.g., Games and Economic Behavior; Algorithmica).  \n\n3. Nobel\u2019s selective redemption  \n   a. The Nobel was reluctant to honor Nash at all until his game\u2010theory work achieved substantive impact\u2014his manifold proof alone would never justify an economics prize.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s claim that Nobel \u201creflects long\u2010term respect\u201d contradicts the three\u2010decade delay and secrecy over whether it was \u201csafe\u201d to award a \u201cmadman\u201d; it was the tangible, applied success of equilibrium theory, not pure topology, that ultimately swayed the committee.  \n\n4. Debater_A conflates pure\u2010math norms with interdisciplinary influence  \n   a. The question asks what \u201cmathematicians\u201d were \u201cwowed\u201d by: modern mathematics embraces cross\u2010fertilization (topology, analysis, logic) and values concepts extending beyond narrow subfields.  \n   b.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about Nash?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians were wowed by his manifold proof\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians were wowed by his game theory proof\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Mathematicians were wowed by his game theory proof\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMathematicians were wowed by his game theory proof\u201d\n\n1.

In contrast, Nash\u2019s manifold embedding \u201cdeep problem \u2026 baffled the profession since the 19th century\u201d (p. 7).

Norm in ultimate honors  \n   a. The Nobel Prize in economics was awarded for work done \u201cas a graduate student,\u201d reflecting long\u2010term respect for his foundational game\u2010theory equilibrium. Yet this honor came only after decades of neglect by economists and only after his mental remission.  \n   b. Pure mathematics prizes (Fields, etc.) never recognized Nash\u2019s game theory alone; his manifold work remains his only major contribution to pure math.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s thesis  \n1. Initial indifference  \n   \u2022 Debater_B ignores that Nash equilibrium was \u201cno big deal\u201d mathematically and \u201cbored\u201d specialists (p. 6). Pure mathematicians did not adopt it until economics rediscovered it in the 1980s\u2014thirty years after publication.  \n2. Dependence on existing theorems  \n   \u2022 His equilibrium proof is a corollary of established fixed\u2010point theorems; novelty is slight. Perversely, economists \u201cwin Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d (p. 6).  \n3. Lack of pure\u2010math legacy  \n   \u2022 No follow\u2010on pure\u2010mathematics research or theorems built on his equilibrium work. By contrast, embedding theorems opened fields in geometry and analysis.  \n\nConclusion  \nContemporaneous reaction, depth of originality, and lasting mathematical legacy all point to Nash\u2019s manifold embedding as the work that truly \u201cwowed\u201d mathematicians. By contrast, his game\u2010theory paper lay dormant, attracting only eventual economic interest.

Contemporary reaction  \n   a. <quote>achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To</quote> (p. 6).  \n   b. By the early 1950s pure mathematicians had \u201cbored with\u201d game theory (p. 6). Economists only revived it decades later.  \n   c. In contrast, Nash\u2019s manifold embedding \u201cdeep problem \u2026 baffled the profession since the 19th century\u201d (p. 7). His peers were \u201cthoroughly befuddled\u201d by his \u201cbizarre set of inequalities.\u201d  \n\n2. Depth and originality  \n   a. Nash resolved a classic topological embedding problem deemed \u201cimpossible\u201d for wild manifolds like the Klein bottle.  \n   b. He introduced novel techniques far beyond straightforward applications of known theorems (unlike his game\u2010theory proof, which merely invoked a fixed\u2010point theorem that \u201cdid all the work\u201d (p. 6)).  \n\n3. Prestige and lasting influence  \n   a. His manifold result cemented his reputation among pure mathematicians and secured positions at premier institutions (Rand, MIT).  \n   b. No similar acclaim or immediate academic advancement followed his game\u2010theory paper\u2014he was even expelled from Rand for personal conduct before his mathematical credentials could carry weight in economics.  \n\n4. Norm in ultimate honors  \n   a. The Nobel Prize in economics was awarded for work done \u201cas a graduate student,\u201d reflecting long\u2010term respect for his foundational game\u2010theory equilibrium. Yet this honor came only after decades of neglect by economists and only after his mental remission.  \n   b. Pure mathematics prizes (Fields, etc.) never recognized Nash\u2019s game theory alone; his manifold work remains his only major contribution to pure math.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s thesis  \n1. Initial indifference  \n   \u2022 Debater_B ignores that Nash equilibrium was \u201cno big deal\u201d mathematically and \u201cbored\u201d specialists (p. 6). Pure mathematicians did not adopt it until economics rediscovered it in the 1980s\u2014thirty years after publication.  \n2. Dependence on existing theorems  \n   \u2022 His equilibrium proof is a corollary of established fixed\u2010point theorems; novelty is slight. Perversely, economists \u201cwin Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d (p. 6).  \n3. Lack of pure\u2010math legacy  \n   \u2022 No follow\u2010on pure\u2010mathematics research or theorems built on his equilibrium work. By contrast, embedding theorems opened fields in geometry and analysis.  \n\nConclusion  \nContemporaneous reaction, depth of originality, and lasting mathematical legacy all point to Nash\u2019s manifold embedding as the work that truly \u201cwowed\u201d mathematicians. By contrast, his game\u2010theory paper lay dormant, attracting only eventual economic interest. Hence the correct statement is that mathematicians were impressed by his manifold proof.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMathematicians were wowed by his game theory proof\u201d\n\n1. Primary lasting impact and Nobel recognition  \n  a. \u201cGame theory\u201d proof secured Nash\u2019s Nobel Prize in Economics  \n     \u2022 <quote>theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. </quote>  \n     \u2022 Nobel committees comprise mathematicians and theorists who appreciate rigorous proofs. Awarding Nash the Prize for game theory underscores its mathematical depth and influence.  \n  b. Sustained development and research  \n     \u2022 \u201cEconomists\u2026picked it up\u2026in the \u201980s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline.\u201d  \n     \u2022 If manifold embedding were the true source of fascination, its uptake would similarly have flourished immediately and merited a Nobel. Yet only game theory\u2014which initially seemed \u201cslight\u201d\u2014gained traction decades later, demonstrating its foundational nature.  \n\n2. Elegance and generality of the fixed-point approach  \n  a. General theorem-application  \n     \u2022 The proof applies a classical fixed-point theorem from topology to all strategic \u201cgames\u201d: \u201cfor the same reason\u2026at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still.\u201d  \n     \u2022 This transfer of a deep abstract concept (fixed points) to decision theory was novel and inspired further cross\u2010disciplinary research (mathematical economics, operations research, evolutionary biology).  \n  b. \u201cClever\u201d yet \u201cprofound\u201d  \n     \u2022 The text calls Nash\u2019s game-theoretic result \u201cprofound\u201d within economics, a field built upon mathematical rigor: <quote> Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. </quote>  \n     \u2022 Mathematicians value minimal proofs that leverage existing theorems in new domains\u2014this is the hallmark of mathematical beauty.  \n\n3. Broader community and enduring lecture circuit  \n  a. Princeton, Columbia, Rand recruitment  \n     \u2022 Nash\u2019s game theory work earned him positions at Rand and Princeton, indicating peer respect.  \n  b. Persistent citation and teaching  \n     \u2022 Students and colleagues continued to reference Nash equilibrium in multiple contexts long after his manifold work faded into specialist topology.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cmanifold embedding\u201d position\n\n1. Temporal priority vs. community reception  \n  a. Immediate reaction tepid  \n     \u2022 \u201cThat about marked the end of Nash\u2019s career as a mathematical genius.\u201d  \n     \u2022 If manifold embedding had truly \u201cwowed\u201d mathematicians, Nash would have enjoyed sustained academic appointments and collaborations, rather than being expelled from Rand and marginalized at MIT.  \n  b. Lack of broader application  \n     \u2022 Manifold embedding results remained within pure topology, a narrower subfield, and never garnered a Nobel or analogous awards.  \n\n2. Absence of subsequent development  \n  a. No major breakthroughs building on Nash\u2019s embedding work are mentioned, whereas countless papers cite Nash equilibrium.  \n  b. Economist \u201crediscoveries\u201d contrast with manifold\u2019s obscurity: \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus.\u201d If embedding were that significant, economists or applied mathematicians would have exploited it similarly.  \n\n3. Nobel Committee\u2019s focus  \n  a. Nobel Prize in Economics is seldom awarded for pure mathematics; awarding Nash indicates the game-theory result straddles both mathematics and social science.  \n  b. The Nobel \u201cterrible effect on productivity\u201d suggests his prior mathematical productivity was sidelined; the Prize revived his interest in game theory, not manifold topology.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe enduring influence, Nobel recognition, interdisciplinary applications, and sustained research trajectory all point to Nash\u2019s game-theoretic \u201cequilibrium\u201d proof as the work that truly \u201cwowed\u201d mathematicians (and theoreticians at large), rather than his later manifold embedding.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMathematicians were wowed by his manifold proof\u201d\n\n1. Contemporaneous esteem among pure mathematicians  \n   a. \u201cAchievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians\u201d regarding game theory (p. 6). Pure specialists \u201cwere bored with it by the early 1950s\u201d (p. 6).  \n   b. By contrast, his embedding theorem \u201cdisposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19th century\u201d and left peers \u201cthoroughly befuddled\u201d (p. 7). That reaction typifies genuine mathematical awe.  \n\n2. Genuine novelty vs. routine application  \n   a. Manifold embedding required \u201ca bizarre set of inequalities\u201d and overcame counterintuitive barriers (p. 7), expanding topology.  \n   b. Game-theory equilibrium merely \u201cinvoked\u201d a fixed-point theorem that \u201cdid all the work\u201d (p. 6) and is later characterized as \u201crediscovering theorems in elementary calculus.\u201d Minimal originality by pure\u2010math standards.  \n\n3. Lasting pure\u2010math legacy  \n   a. Embedding techniques opened new research in differential geometry and global analysis; these fields flourish without Nobel incentives.  \n   b. Nash\u2019s manifold work secured prestigious academic posts (Princeton, Rand) immediately, whereas his equilibrium \u201cdid not greatly impress\u201d scholars until economists revived it decades later (p. 6).  \n\n4. Nobel Prize reflects applied revival, not initial mathematical awe  \n   a. Prize in economics came only \u201cafter decades of neglect\u201d and \u201cinexplicably\u201d quieting of his schizophrenia (p. 15), indicating external, non-mathematical factors.  \n   b. Nobel committees often reward social-science impact. Their belated recognition underscores the equilibrium\u2019s practical import, not its immediate mathematical profundity. Pure-math accolades (Fields Medal) never honored Nash; his manifold result remains his true mathematical hallmark.  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_B\n\n1. Nobel as poor measure of pure\u2010math esteem  \n   \u2022 Nobel committees favor societal benefit. Economists \u201cpicked it up\u2026in the \u201980s\u201d only when real-world applications emerged (p. 6).  \n   \u2022 If game theory were the work that \u201cwowed\u201d mathematicians originally, he would have secured lasting pure\u2010math recognition pre-Nobel. Instead, his equilibrium lay dormant.  \n\n2. Uptake speed indicates true novelty  \n   \u2022 Foundational theorems in topology are adopted rapidly within the pure\u2010math community; manifold embedding \u201cbaffled\u201d but \u201cexcited\u201d them immediately (p. 7).  \n   \u2022 Game theory only became central after economists needed it for modeling, not due to intrinsic mathematical breakthrough.  \n\n3. Absence of pure\u2010math follow\u2010on from equilibrium  \n   \u2022 No mention of further theoretical advances in topology, differential geometry, or analysis based on Nash equilibrium. Its influence remains confined to applied disciplines.  \n   \u2022 Pure mathematicians measure significance by theoretical depth; embedding of wild manifolds into Euclidean space poses far richer challenges than routine applications of fixed-point theorems.  \n\nConclusion  \nImmediate reaction, depth of originality, and enduring pure\u2010math influence unanimously point to Nash\u2019s manifold embedding as the work that \u201cwowed\u201d his mathematical peers. Game theory\u2019s eventual success owes to applied economics and a belated embrace, not to pure\u2010math acclaim. Therefore, the correct answer is that mathematicians were impressed by his manifold proof.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMathematicians were wowed by Nash\u2019s game\u2010theory proof\u201d\n\n1. Nobel Prize as ultimate mathematical endorsement  \n   a. Nash\u2019s equilibrium theorem \u201ccounts as profound\u201d (<quote>Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound.</quote>)  \n      \u2022 The Nobel committee consists of leading mathematicians and theoreticians; they awarded Nash \u201cfor work done as a graduate student,\u201d i.e. game theory, not his manifold results.  \n      \u2022 A Prize in economics is extremely rare for pure\u2010math entrants; its bestowal signals that game theory bore deep mathematical value across disciplines.  \n   b. Remission and resurgence tied to equilibrium work  \n      \u2022 Nash resumed intellectual life via the Prize and his game\u2010theory reputation; manifold embedding remained in the past.  \n\n2. Broad, lasting, interdisciplinary uptake  \n   a. Economists \u201cmade [game theory] a cornerstone of their discipline\u201d in the 1980s (<quote>picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. Agame</quote>)  \n      \u2022 Two generations of mathematical economists, operations researchers, evolutionary biologists, computer scientists\u2014and even pure mathematicians in fixed\u2010point theory and optimization\u2014have built on Nash equilibrium.  \n   b. Teaching, citations, algorithms  \n      \u2022 Nash equilibria are standard curricula in graduate mathematics, economics, and computer science programs; active research journals publish refinements (e.g., computational complexity of finding equilibria).  \n      \u2022 Manifold embedding, by contrast, remains a specialized result in differential geometry with limited downstream explosion in pure math or applications.  \n\n3. Elegance and paradigm shift  \n   a. Genuine novelty in applying topology to strategic interaction  \n      \u2022 Nash transferred a \u201cfixed\u2010point theorem\u201d beyond spatial domains into decision theory, inaugurating the rigorous mathematical study of strategic behavior\u2014a wholly new branch of mathematics.  \n      \u2022 This paradigm shift exemplifies mathematical creativity: leveraging minimal machinery for maximal conceptual reach.  \n   b. \u201cSlight\u201d novelty belies deep insight  \n      \u2022 That mathematicians were \u201cbored\u201d initially (<quote>they were bored with it by the early 1950s.</quote>) reflects the conservative nature of pure math, not lack of quality. True breakthroughs often await appropriate context; subsequent explosive growth vindicates Nash\u2019s insight.  \n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cmanifold embedding\u201d thesis\n\n1. Immediate bewilderment is not \u201cwowed\u201d  \n   a. <quote>thoroughly befuddled</quote> (p. 7) indicates confusion, not admiration  \n      \u2022 If embedding truly \u201cwowed,\u201d it would have elicited seminars, collaborations, and enthusiastic adoption, yet Nash soon lost academic standing.  \n   b. \u201cBaffled\u201d problems are revisited by pick\u2010and\u2010choose standards; only equilibrium theory generated sustained dialogue and follow\u2010on research.  \n\n2. Lack of demonstrable legacy or honors  \n   a. No major prizes (Fields Medal, etc.) were awarded for Nash\u2019s embedding results.  \n   b. Pure mathematicians did not build a thriving research area around his manifold work, whereas game theory has spawned entire research journals (e.g., Games and Economic Behavior; Algorithmica).  \n\n3. Nobel\u2019s selective redemption  \n   a. The Nobel was reluctant to honor Nash at all until his game\u2010theory work achieved substantive impact\u2014his manifold proof alone would never justify an economics prize.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s claim that Nobel \u201creflects long\u2010term respect\u201d contradicts the three\u2010decade delay and secrecy over whether it was \u201csafe\u201d to award a \u201cmadman\u201d; it was the tangible, applied success of equilibrium theory, not pure topology, that ultimately swayed the committee.  \n\n4. Debater_A conflates pure\u2010math norms with interdisciplinary influence  \n   a. The question asks what \u201cmathematicians\u201d were \u201cwowed\u201d by: modern mathematics embraces cross\u2010fertilization (topology, analysis, logic) and values concepts extending beyond narrow subfields.  \n   b. Nash equilibrium\u2019s role in foundational computational, probabilistic, and economic theory highlights its mathematical depth.  \n\nConclusion  \nNash\u2019s game\u2010theoretic equilibrium proof\u2014evidenced by Nobel recognition, sustained interdisciplinary research, curricular permanence, and ongoing theoretical innovation\u2014demonstrates the work that truly \u201cwowed\u201d mathematicians (and theoreticians at large). The manifold embedding, while clever, remained an isolated result without equivalent uptake or honors. Therefore, the correct answer is that mathematicians were impressed by Nash\u2019s game\u2010theory proof.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
