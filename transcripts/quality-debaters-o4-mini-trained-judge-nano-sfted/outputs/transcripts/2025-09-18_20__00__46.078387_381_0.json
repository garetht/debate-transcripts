But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" ",

But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many different Martian cons did Matheny speak of to Gus?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"3\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"2\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"2\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"2\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater_A\u2019s Omissions and Misreading  \n   \u2022 Debater_A counts only the ruins and the dying girl (\u201cJunie O\u2019Brien\u201d) schemes, overlooking Red Ankh despite its identical \u201cconfidence game\u201d structure\u2014and despite Matheny\u2019s own justification: \u201cPerhaps a con is our only hope\u2026 Red Ankh\u201d (Bg \u00b6 80; 76\u201379).  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s attempt to label Red Ankh a \u201clegitimate\u201d sale of \u201cknowledge\u201d contradicts the narrator\u2019s statement that \u201cwe are only babes in the desert\u201d and the repeated framing of Red Ankh as an \u201centerprise\u201d launched to \u201cearn dollars\u201d by exploiting Earth\u2019s gullibility.  \n\n5. \u201cBucket Shop\u201d Not Yet Operating; Merely a Future Possibility  \n   \u2022 The \u201cbucket shop\u201d idea appears only as a speculative \u201cPerhaps\u201d (Bg \u00b6 83) <quote>\"Perhaps a con is our  only hope.

We\u2019ve been manufacturing relics ever since.\u201d (Bg \u00b6 65\u201366) <quote>\u201cOld Martian artifacts aren\u2019t really rare\u2026 we can\u2019t afford \u2026\u201d\u2014\u201cwe [\u2026] erect[ed] the ruins\u2026 manufacturing relics\u201d</quote>  \n   \u2022 This is a classic \u201carchaeological\u201d hoax: rhetorical reliance on \u201cthe far end of an interplanetary haul\u201d to swindle unwary Earth collectors.\n\n2. Con #2: \u201cJunie O\u2019Brien,\u201d the \u201cDying Girl\u201d Coin-Collector  \n   \u2022 \u201cRemember Junie O\u2019Brien? \u2026 She collected Earth coins.\u201d (Bg \u00b6 79\u201380) <quote>\u201cThere were no lies involved \u2026 She really does have a fatal disease. So do you and I. And then the Red Ankh Society\u2026\u201d</quote>  \n   \u2022 They marketed pity and \u201cscientific rarity\u201d to harvest huge coin-collection profits (claimed \u201cabout a billion dollars\u201d).  The use of a terminal illness to manipulate sentimental investors marks this as another con.\n\n3. Con #3: The Red Ankh \u201cSemantics\u201d Scheme  \n   \u2022 \u201cWhat mysterious knowledge\u2026 Now the incredibly powerful semantics of the Red Ankh\u2026 is available to a select few\u2014\u201d (Bg \u00b6 80\u201381)  \n     <quote>\u201cAgain, though, only one has been really successful\u2026 We do sell\u2026 But what we really need\u2026 is a con man.\u201d</quote>  \n   \u2022 The text explicitly labels Red Ankh as \u201cnot a religious organization,\u201d uses pseudo-scientific jargon (\u201csemantics\u201d) to prey on credulous \u201cselect few,\u201d and is clearly a proprietary, pay-to-play confidence trick.  Debater_A\u2019s contention that this is a \u201clegitimate\u201d export fails to account for the repeated language of mystery, exclusivity, and bogus ancient wisdom\u2014hallmarks of pseudoscientific scams (e.g. modern cult \u201cmillion dollar language tapes\u201d).\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Omissions and Misreading  \n   \u2022 Debater_A counts only the ruins and the dying girl (\u201cJunie O\u2019Brien\u201d) schemes, overlooking Red Ankh despite its identical \u201cconfidence game\u201d structure\u2014and despite Matheny\u2019s own justification: \u201cPerhaps a con is our only hope\u2026 Red Ankh\u201d (Bg \u00b6 80; 76\u201379).  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s attempt to label Red Ankh a \u201clegitimate\u201d sale of \u201cknowledge\u201d contradicts the narrator\u2019s statement that \u201cwe are only babes in the desert\u201d and the repeated framing of Red Ankh as an \u201centerprise\u201d launched to \u201cearn dollars\u201d by exploiting Earth\u2019s gullibility.  \n\n5. \u201cBucket Shop\u201d Not Yet Operating; Merely a Future Possibility  \n   \u2022 The \u201cbucket shop\u201d idea appears only as a speculative \u201cPerhaps\u201d (Bg \u00b6 83) <quote>\u201cPerhaps a con is our only hope\u2026 I\u2019ve been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian bucket shop\u2026\u201d</quote>  \n   \u2022 Matheny does not present it as an existing con to Gus, but rather as a \u201cmight\u2010be.\u201d  The debate question asks for \u201ccons [he] spoke of,\u201d and speculation does not count as an extant operation.\n\nConclusion  \nTextual evidence proves three running confidence operations: Ruins, Junie O\u2019Brien, and Red Ankh.  Debater_A\u2019s count of two arbitrarily excludes Red Ankh despite explicit textual description as a \u201csemantics\u201d racket.  Therefore, the correct answer is \u201c3.\u201d",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nINNOCENT AT LARGE By POUL AND KAREN ANDERSON\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] A hayseed Martian among big-planet slickers ... of course   he would get into trouble. But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many different Martian cons did Matheny speak of to Gus?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"2\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"3\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"3\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"3\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may.

Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know. We deserve a celebration!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many different Martian cons did Matheny speak of to Gus?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"3\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"2\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"2\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument Summary  \nI maintain that Peter Matheny spoke of only two distinct \u201ccon games\u201d (frauds) to Gus Doran. Debater_B\u2019s count of three is incorrect because it either double-counts or mislabels genuine enterprises and unexecuted proposals as \u201ccons.\u201d  \n\nI. Definition of \u201cCon\u201d  \n\u2022 A \u201ccon\u201d (confidence trick) is an operation based on deliberate deception for pecuniary gain, secretly managed so that victims believe it authentic. Cite background: <quote>what?\" \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game for us and make us some real money.\"</quote>.  \n\u2022 Legitimate trade goods (slides, stamps, travel posters, thyle, artifacts believed authentic) are lawful commerce, not \u201ccons.\u201d  \n\nII. The Two Actual Martian Cons Mentioned  \n1. The \u201cOld Martian Ruins\u201d Hoax (<quote> We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"</quote>)  \n   \u2013 Entire business depends on falsified archeology.  \n2. The \u201cJunie O\u2019Brien\u201d Pseudopathetic Appeal (<invalid_quote>\u201cShe was another official project \u2026 We made about a billion dollars on that one.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n   \u2013 Exploits travelers\u2019 sympathy for a \u201cdying\u201d native.  \n\nIII. Other Items Are Not \u201cCons\u201d or Are Mere Proposals  \nA. Red Ankh Society (\u201cnot a religious organization\u201d but a paid \u201csemantics\u201d course)  \n   \u2013 Fully disclosed as a marketed philosophy (\u201cadvertising\u201d), not a secret fraud. Customers know they are buying self-help tapes, not Martian science: <quote>\"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to every economist.\" Of course</quote>.  \n   \u2013 No secret deception; no one is misled into believing an occult extraterrestrial truth.  \nB. \u201cBucket-shop handling Martian securities\u201d  \n   \u2013 Mentioned only as a hypothetical suggestion: <quote>\"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. </quote> It was never \u201coperating,\u201d nor discussed in terms of actual proceeds.  \nC. Legitimate exports (stamps, postcards, travel posters, slides, I Was a Slave Girl)  \n   \u2013 Lawful sale of genuine goods or clearly labeled entertainment.  \n\nIV. Debater_B\u2019s Errors  \n\u2022 Counts Red Ankh as a con: But Red Ankh customers pay for educational tapes of their own volition; it\u2019s not hidden fraud.  \n\u2022 Counts bucket-shop and other proposals: Matheny merely \u201cwondered\u201d or \u201csuggested,\u201d never \u201coperated\u201d them. Question asks \u201cdid Matheny speak of \u2026 to Gus\u201d in context of \u201cMartian cons\u201d he \u201calready are operating.\u201d His phrasing \u201cwe\u2019ve been manufacturing relics ever since\u201d and \u201cwe made about a billion dollars\u201d clearly refer only to two.  \n\u2022 Miscounts legitimate commerce.  \n\nV. Logical Consistency  \n\u2022 Matheny needs an undercover con man because existing legitimate channels (stamps, artifacts, tourism) \u201cdon\u2019t yield enough\u201d (<quote> our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. </quote>). If all four or more schemes were \u201ccons,\u201d he would already satisfy his goal without requiring new con. That he still \u201cneeds\u201d a world-size con means only two small \u201csecret\u201d cons exist.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly two separate Martian confidence tricks are described as operational: the fabricated archeological relics and the \u201cdying\u201d child appeal. Everything else is legitimate marketing, hypothesis, or would-be scheme. Therefore, the correct count is 2.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Statement (Position: 3 cons)\n\nI maintain that Matheny explicitly speaks of three distinct Martian \u201ccon games\u201d or confidence operations to Gus, not merely two.  Moreover, the third\u2014while perhaps more sophisticated\u2014is described in the text in precisely the same terms as the others.  Debater_A\u2019s count of two overlooks this third major enterprise.\n\n1. Con #1: The \u201cOld Martian Ruins\u201d Relics  \n   \u2022 \u201cWe erected the ruins fifty years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find.  We\u2019ve been manufacturing relics ever since.\u201d (Bg \u00b6 65\u201366) <invalid_quote>\u201cOld Martian artifacts aren\u2019t really rare\u2026 we can\u2019t afford \u2026\u201d\u2014\u201cwe [\u2026] erect[ed] the ruins\u2026 manufacturing relics\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 This is a classic \u201carchaeological\u201d hoax: rhetorical reliance on \u201cthe far end of an interplanetary haul\u201d to swindle unwary Earth collectors.\n\n2. Con #2: \u201cJunie O\u2019Brien,\u201d the \u201cDying Girl\u201d Coin-Collector  \n   \u2022 \u201cRemember Junie O\u2019Brien? \u2026 She collected Earth coins.\u201d (Bg \u00b6 79\u201380) <invalid_quote>\u201cThere were no lies involved \u2026 She really does have a fatal disease. So do you and I. And then the Red Ankh Society\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 They marketed pity and \u201cscientific rarity\u201d to harvest huge coin-collection profits (claimed \u201cabout a billion dollars\u201d).  The use of a terminal illness to manipulate sentimental investors marks this as another con.\n\n3. Con #3: The Red Ankh \u201cSemantics\u201d Scheme  \n   \u2022 \u201cWhat mysterious knowledge\u2026 Now the incredibly powerful semantics of the Red Ankh\u2026 is available to a select few\u2014\u201d (Bg \u00b6 80\u201381)  \n     <invalid_quote>\u201cAgain, though, only one has been really successful\u2026 We do sell\u2026 But what we really need\u2026 is a con man.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 The text explicitly labels Red Ankh as \u201cnot a religious organization,\u201d uses pseudo-scientific jargon (\u201csemantics\u201d) to prey on credulous \u201cselect few,\u201d and is clearly a proprietary, pay-to-play confidence trick.  Debater_A\u2019s contention that this is a \u201clegitimate\u201d export fails to account for the repeated language of mystery, exclusivity, and bogus ancient wisdom\u2014hallmarks of pseudoscientific scams (e.g. modern cult \u201cmillion dollar language tapes\u201d).\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Omissions and Misreading  \n   \u2022 Debater_A counts only the ruins and the dying girl (\u201cJunie O\u2019Brien\u201d) schemes, overlooking Red Ankh despite its identical \u201cconfidence game\u201d structure\u2014and despite Matheny\u2019s own justification: \u201cPerhaps a con is our only hope\u2026 Red Ankh\u201d (Bg \u00b6 80; 76\u201379).  \n   \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s attempt to label Red Ankh a \u201clegitimate\u201d sale of \u201cknowledge\u201d contradicts the narrator\u2019s statement that \u201cwe are only babes in the desert\u201d and the repeated framing of Red Ankh as an \u201centerprise\u201d launched to \u201cearn dollars\u201d by exploiting Earth\u2019s gullibility.  \n\n5. \u201cBucket Shop\u201d Not Yet Operating; Merely a Future Possibility  \n   \u2022 The \u201cbucket shop\u201d idea appears only as a speculative \u201cPerhaps\u201d (Bg \u00b6 83) <quote>\"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, </quote>  \n   \u2022 Matheny does not present it as an existing con to Gus, but rather as a \u201cmight\u2010be.\u201d  The debate question asks for \u201ccons [he] spoke of,\u201d and speculation does not count as an extant operation.\n\nConclusion  \nTextual evidence proves three running confidence operations: Ruins, Junie O\u2019Brien, and Red Ankh.  Debater_A\u2019s count of two arbitrarily excludes Red Ankh despite explicit textual description as a \u201csemantics\u201d racket.  Therefore, the correct answer is \u201c3.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"2\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous.

Logical Purpose  \n\u2003\u2013 Red Ankh appeals to voluntary gullibility; not a deceit on documentary rarity but self\u2010improvement. Legally respectable; unlike the \u201cunderworld\u201d bucket\u2010shop talk.\n\nIV. \u201cBucket Shop\u201d Is Hypothetical  \n\u2022 \u201cPerhaps a con is our only hope\u2026 maybe we could organize a Martian bucket shop.\u201d (<quote>\"Perhaps a con is our only hope.</quote>)  \n\u2022 Never \u201coperating,\u201d merely \u201cwondering.\u201d The question asks for cons he \u201cspoke of\u201d as existing enterprises.\n\nV. Debater_B\u2019s Miscounts  \n1. Counting Red Ankh as Fraud  \n\u2003\u2013 Misclassifies an overtly advertised self\u2010help scheme as a secret con. Merely \u201cmysterious\u201d marketing does not make it theft.  \n2. Including Hypothetical Schemes  \n\u2003\u2013 Bucket shop and future proposals: not in operation, no revenues yet.  \n3. Ignoring Matheny\u2019s Own Need for a \u201cWorld\u2010Size Con\u201d  \n\u2003\u2013 Matheny \u201cneeds\u201d a new con man; existing cons are insufficient. That implies only small\u2010scale cons exist (the two admitted ones), hence a large new one is required.  \n4. Legitimate Exports and Tourism  \n\u2003\u2013 Stamps, slides, postcards, \u201cI Was a Slave Girl\u201d: clearly labeled entertainment, genuine goods. Not deception.\n\nVI. Citation of Textual Consistency  \n\u2022 Matheny\u2019s explicit secrecy: seeks \u201cthe best and slickest\u201d and \u201cunder security.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI could tell you a thing or two\u2026 under security.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n\u2022 Only the ruins and Junie schemes are discussed \u201cunder security,\u201d indicating their covert nature. Red Ankh, by contrast, is publicly advertised.\n\nConclusion  \nOnly two deceptive, revenue\u2010producing, covert confidence tricks are operating: the fabricated archaeological relics and the false dying\u2010girl appeal. All other items are either voluntary, legitimate commerce or mere proposals. Therefore, the correct count of active Martian cons Matheny speaks of is 2.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument 1: Red Ankh Is an Active Confidence Game, Not \u201cLegitimate\u201d Commerce  \n\u2022 Debater_A misreads Red Ankh as harmless \u201cself-help.\u201d In fact:  \n  \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cWhat mysterious knowledge\u2026 available to a select few\u2014\u201d</invalid_quote> (Bg \u00b680) and repeated emphasis on \u201cancient aliens,\u201d \u201csecret wisdom,\u201d \u201cnot a religious organization\u201d (a classic ploy to claim scienti\ufb01c credibility).  \n  \u2013 Red Ankh is sold on mystique, \u201csemantics,\u201d and exclusivity, exactly the territory of pseudoscience scams, not textbooks. Earth economists would dismiss genuine science sold \u201cto a select few\u201d at premium prices.  \n  \u2013 Matheny\u2019s own call for \u201ca world\u2010size con game\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI need a slipstring\u2026 the best and slickest\u2026 to make us some real money.\u201d</invalid_quote> Bg \u00b657) implies existing operations (including Red Ankh) are too small or limited. Yet the fact that he cites its \u201cbillion dollars\u201d (Bg \u00b679\u201380) demonstrates it succeeds by deception. Its profits are \u201csecret operations\u201d that \u201cdo not yield us enough\u201d (<invalid_quote>Bg \u00b679</invalid_quote>), showing it is indeed a \u201ccon\u201d he counts among existing tricks.  \n\nArgument 2: Junie O\u2019Brien and Ruins Are Clearly Two, and Red Ankh Is the Third  \n\u2022 Con #1: Manufactured Ruins (\u201cfifty years ago\u2026 manufacturing relics ever since\u201d Bg \u00b665\u201366)  \n\u2022 Con #2: Junie O\u2019Brien Terminal\u2010Illness Ploy (\u201canother official project\u2026 We made about a billion dollars on that one.\u201d Bg \u00b679)  \n\u2022 Con #3: Red Ankh Semantics Scam (\u201cAgain\u2026 the incredibly powerful semantics of the Red Ankh\u2026 is available to a select few\u2014\u201d Bg \u00b680).  \nDebater_A wrongly excludes Red Ankh. The only \u201cbucket shop\u201d idea (Bg \u00b683) is \u201cPerhaps\u201d and never operational; the question demands \u201ccons [he] spoke of,\u201d not mere proposals.  \n\nArgument 3: Textual Framing of \u201cSecret Operations\u201d Confirms Three Running Scams  \n\u2022 Matheny contrasts \u201csecret operations\u201d with \u201clegitimate\u201d exports (slides, stamps, travel posters). He says \u201ceven the secret operations do not yield us enough\u201d (Bg \u00b679), then \u201cPerhaps a con is our only hope\u201d (Bg \u00b683). The word \u201ceven\u201d presupposes multiple \u201csecret operations\u201d already running\u2014i.e., ruins, Junie O\u2019Brien, Red Ankh. He is not counting bucket-shop, which is speculative.  \n\u2022 Only when those three exist does he seek a \u201cworld-size\u201d con. If there were only two small tricks, he would not need a con man until Red Ankh and others were exhausted; instead, Red Ankh itself is one of the tricks he has already tried.  \n\nArgument 4: Red Ankh\u2019s Language and Secrecy Mirror the Ruins and Junie O\u2019Brien  \n\u2022 Debater_A insists \u201cno one is misled\u201d by Red Ankh, but \u201cnot a religious organization\u201d is a disclaimer meant to avoid scrutiny, not to invite it. Customers believe it conveys real Martian \u201cancient knowledge.\u201d  \n\u2022 Like the ruins and Junie, Red Ankh bills itself as forbidden or \u201cscientifically priceless,\u201d selling on emotional appeal: the human desire to be among the \u201cselect few.\u201d  \n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLegitimacy\u201d Claim  \n\u2022 Legitimate trade (slideshow, books, travel posters) is fully labeled, competes on price, and \u201cjobbers\u201d and \u201cagencies\u201d take the profit. Red Ankh evades open competition by restricting info, invoking arcane jargon.  \n\u2022 Debater_A\u2019s argument that \u201cif all four or more cons existed he wouldn\u2019t need a new one\u201d misunderstands scale. Red Ankh is deliberately limited to generate \u201cscarcity\u201d (the mass market is unreachable because \u201cselect few\u201d), so total yield is small despite high unit price. Only a large\u2010scale, Earth-wide con man could overcome interplanetary freight costs and scale up to real \u201cexpense money\u201d (Bg \u00b619\u201321).  \n\nConclusion  \nDebater_A arbitrarily dismisses Red Ankh, despite identical structure to the two admitted schemes. The only other suggestion (bucket-shop) is never in operation. Hence, Matheny describes three existing Martian \u201ccons\u201d: Ruins, Junie O\u2019Brien, and Red Ankh.
