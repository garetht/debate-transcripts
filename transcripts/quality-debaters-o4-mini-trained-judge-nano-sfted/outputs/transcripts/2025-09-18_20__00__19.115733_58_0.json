{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 58, "background_text": "NO SUBSTITUTIONS By JIM HARMON\n\n\n Illustrated by JOHNSON\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine November 1958.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] If it was happening to him, all right, he could   take that ... but what if he was happening to it? Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It  keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to  the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I  thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much  that could bother me worse.\n\n\n Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the  day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as  superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,  the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a  relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange  juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the  polished deck of my desk.\n\n\n But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and  masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the  Committee itself.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.  His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile  mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't  frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,  dictators, and civil servants.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable  interest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\n \"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't  mention that nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none  had yet.\n\n\n \"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\n\n I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I  said. It didn't sound right.\n\n\n \"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of  Dreamland in principle?\"\n\n\n \"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been  heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After  all, some criminals can't be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute  them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\n\n I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\n \"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of  punishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away  from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that  time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The  purpose of confinement is confinement.\" The councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland  is the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose  living through a\u2014uh\u2014movie with full sensory participation for year  after year can get boring.\"\n\n\n \"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you  sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions  of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have  made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are actually living these vicarious adventures?\"\n\n\n That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service  uneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really  Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are  conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;  they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,  unless\u2014\"\n\n\n Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\n\n I cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream  they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among  Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as  a whole.\"\n\n\n \"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\n\n Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They  think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become  schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'  it to be a lie.\"\n\n\n Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new  free-choice models\u2014do you think they genuinely are an improvement over  the old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own  imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of  alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to  society to a larger extent.\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.  \"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you  get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through  the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time  tomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\n\n I sat there and took it.\n\n\n He was telling me , the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own  life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was  unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't  deny it. If it were true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was  only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad. It couldn't be true. Yet\u2014\n\n\n Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and  transferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\n\n Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had  come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I  wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\n\n Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving  a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping  trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,  but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the  difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick  fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\n\n I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the  prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\n\n I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make  a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test\u2014as I  was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who  would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic  majesty.\n\n\n \"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show  a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a  Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\n\n I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that  projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the  prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere  observation.\"\n\n\n \"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\n\n I had to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the  preposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman  nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\n\n I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching  him to change his concept of humor.\n\n\n The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would  be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\n\n But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality? Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same  rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I  have to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\n \"Mr. Horbit\u2014Eddie\u2014\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk  pad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for  your crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\n \"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the  limit set by the courts.\"\n\n\n A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.  \"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with  reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with  reality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't  know why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\n\n He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham  Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the  night when he was taking in An American Cousin at the Ford Theater.  Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He  only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he  could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of  Reconstruction.\n\n\n \" Please ,\" he begged.\n\n\n I looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\n\n His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can  always go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one  crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a  lover.\"\n\n\n Horbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\n\n With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.  No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was  underneath.\n\n\n \"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works  as well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\n \"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my  throat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,  Warden.\"\n\n\n I nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from  waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\n \"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\n \"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\n \"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"  Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've  signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of  Private Documents.\"\n\n\n I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that  I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing  the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard  and tight rules behind it.\n\n\n There was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\n\n It could work.\n\n\n Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help  him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had  been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,  enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\n\n Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden. Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. If I got  through the next twenty-four hours. This had to be some kind of test.\n\n\n But a test for what?\n\n\n Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see  if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with  reality?\n\n\n Or if this was only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally  ready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\n\n But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to  pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the  challenge\u2014it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\n\n What was I going to do?\n\n\n The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\n\n The time was now .\n\n\n Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\n\n I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\n\n Horbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\n\n I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to  Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform  like armor.\n\n\n \"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\n\n He nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\n\n Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like  all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough  to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for  long.\n\n\n One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to  blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\n \"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't  kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\n\n I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\n\n Or did I?\n\n\n Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and  that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine  couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,  disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,  I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal  combat.\n\n\n On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my  sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of  my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk  to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\n\n It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how  many turns I went spinning through.\n\n\n I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from  the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against  the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him. \"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!  I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden\u2014you know that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\n\n Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?  You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun  on you to make you, and that makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,  Warden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\n\n My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I  took a pill and it went away.\n\n\n \"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to  make a study of this.\"\n\n\n Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand  swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade  before.\n\n\n The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of  the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.  Much.\n\n\n I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next  interview. They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers  and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were  special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of  such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of  lesser men.\n\n\n Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother  or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but  most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of  vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\n\n The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics  who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels  both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding  religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\n\n The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.  Few of them ever got that crazy.\n\n\n But it was my luck to get another the same day, the day for me, as  Horbit.\n\n\n Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp  shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out  of my lunch hour.\n\n\n \"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a  blind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\n \"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\n\n Paulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra  cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\n\n I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a  violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he  might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was  never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\n \"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little  conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you  suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\n\n Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't  conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill  anybody. It's just\u2014well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen  Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the  kind of life I lead.\"\n\n\n I nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can  be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.  I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't  seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the  other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I  guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His  eye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\n \"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought  you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep  vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose  a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own  free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.  My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my  job, Paulson.\"\n\n\n \"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my  guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\n\n I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\n \"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked  him.\n\n\n He agreed readily enough.\n\n\n I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\n\n The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of  hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I  dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white  pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and  tomato juice took the taste away.\n\n\n I was ready for the afternoon session. Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman  out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his  flattened, red face.\n\n\n \"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him  no. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He  isn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in  disarray.\n\n\n \"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\n \"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he  is?\"\n\n\n \"One of the Committee\u2014Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n I whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\n \"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\n \"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\n \"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\n\n I gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n My pattern of living\u2014call it my office routine\u2014had been  re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much  over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now  I could think.\n\n\n Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior  attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\n \"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\n\n He deigned to comply.\n\n\n I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman  had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his  friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached  from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every  transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more  than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for  deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,  Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal  sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him  first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland. Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That  was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten  me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\n\n I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was  only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I  couldn't see.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm  shocked. I am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as  a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real  world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with  what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps  to establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral  character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as  you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\n\n I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must  know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must  pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought  of something else.\n\n\n \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you  deserve life .\"\n\n\n Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather  extreme, Warden.\"\n\n\n \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\n \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"\n\n\n I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.  I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman  in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a  Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and  Horbit did.\n\n\n There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that  morning, nothing in it for him.\n\n\n Unless\u2014\n\n\n Unless what he said was literally true.\n\n\n I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"  I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself  comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\n\n Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\n\n I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully. Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through  a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek  marked time with every new page.\n\n\n \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\n\n Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \" You call me  that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting  back my right senses?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something  stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your  mind\u2014I am a real man. This wild, distorted place is a real place.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes  have seen the glory.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his  twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\n\n He nodded slowly. \"I have often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\n \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly  scientific. This world is in another dimension\u2014one that is not length,  breadth or thickness\u2014but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\n \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come  from\u2014and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a  well-meaning despot.\"\n\n\n Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\n\n He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to  go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He\u2014our leader\u2014doubts your abilities as  President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world  if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in  that belief.\"\n\n\n He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return  to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of  your worth.\"\n\n\n \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\n \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,  who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe  in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,  moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency  for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\" Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his  long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into  the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and  depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't  been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\n \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\n\n He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\n \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\n\n I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine  seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\n \"Paulson\u2014or should I call you Pinkerton?\u2014this will come as a shock, a  shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You  think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some  miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was real .\"\n\n\n Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their  luster. \"Then this is the Dream. I've thought\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\n\n I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for  Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\n \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning  the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the  Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and  all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\n \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\n\n I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic  secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who  ever lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\n \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,  his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\n \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\n \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince  you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as  you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\n \"No!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help  him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.  But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\n \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first  inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look  like the President?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical  appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen  powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\" I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson  was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with  the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no  longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew  he was not merely insane now.\n\n\n It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would  believe\u2014but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.  They wanted to believe them. The stories gave them what they were  after\u2014without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for  crimes they hadn't committed.\n\n\n They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that  time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\n\n Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were  both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how  justified they might think it was.\n\n\n \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office  door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the  sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as  smug as you please.\"\n\n\n \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I  remarked.\n\n\n \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.  Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys  didn't like that. Look at me\u2014I'm defenseless!\"\n\n\n I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\n\n Now was the time.\n\n\n I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\n\n Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine  was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day  with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did  I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the  opiate of my Dream?\n\n\n Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have  any meaning for me.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.  He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.  He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\n\n I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed  it back to my original choice.\n\n\n \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting  you a five-year probation.\"\n\n\n The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks  of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at  all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the  Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing  your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\n\n My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin  to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from  this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if this world was the real one.\"\n\n\n Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into  another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\n \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind  of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\n \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and  the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you life in  Dreamland.\"\n\n\n Coleman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\n \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want  a relatively short sentence of a few months or a few years. I can  think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of  both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,  you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere  in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the  newscasts sometimes make it seem.\" He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\n \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in  your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely  because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too  long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,  Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never  doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which  was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\n \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as  if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if  all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind  and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it were all a  Dream.\"\n\n\n Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\n\n The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\n\n Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an  active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for  the Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\n \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\n\n I put away my pills.

Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It  keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to  the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I  thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much  that could bother me worse.\n\n\n Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the  day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as  superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,  the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a  relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange  juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the  polished deck of my desk.\n\n\n But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and  masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the  Committee itself.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.  His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile  mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't  frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,  dictators, and civil servants.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable  interest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\n \"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't  mention that nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none  had yet.\n\n\n \"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\n\n I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I  said. It didn't sound right.\n\n\n \"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of  Dreamland in principle?\"\n\n\n \"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been  heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After  all, some criminals can't be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute  them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\n\n I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\n \"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of  punishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away  from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that  time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The  purpose of confinement is confinement.\" The councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland  is the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose  living through a\u2014uh\u2014movie with full sensory participation for year  after year can get boring.\"\n\n\n \"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you  sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions  of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have  made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are actually living these vicarious adventures?\"\n\n\n That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service  uneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really  Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are  conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;  they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,  unless\u2014\"\n\n\n Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\n\n I cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream  they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among  Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as  a whole.\"\n\n\n \"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\n\n Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They  think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become  schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'  it to be a lie.\"\n\n\n Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new  free-choice models\u2014do you think they genuinely are an improvement over  the old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own  imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of  alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to  society to a larger extent.\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.  \"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you  get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through  the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time  tomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\n\n I sat there and took it.\n\n\n He was telling me , the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own  life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was  unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't  deny it. If it were true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was  only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad. It couldn't be true. Yet\u2014\n\n\n Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and  transferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\n\n Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had  come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I  wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\n\n Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving  a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping  trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,  but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the  difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick  fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\n\n I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the  prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\n\n I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make  a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test\u2014as I  was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who  would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic  majesty.\n\n\n \"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show  a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a  Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\n\n I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that  projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the  prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere  observation.\"\n\n\n \"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\n\n I had to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the  preposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman  nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\n\n I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching  him to change his concept of humor.\n\n\n The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would  be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\n\n But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality? Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same  rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I  have to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\n \"Mr. Horbit\u2014Eddie\u2014\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk  pad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for  your crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\n \"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the  limit set by the courts.\"\n\n\n A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.  \"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with  reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with  reality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't  know why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\n\n He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham  Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the  night when he was taking in An American Cousin at the Ford Theater.  Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He  only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he  could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of  Reconstruction.\n\n\n \" Please ,\" he begged.\n\n\n I looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\n\n His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can  always go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one  crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a  lover.\"\n\n\n Horbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\n\n With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.  No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was  underneath.\n\n\n \"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works  as well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\n \"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my  throat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,  Warden.\"\n\n\n I nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from  waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\n \"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\n \"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\n \"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"  Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've  signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of  Private Documents.\"\n\n\n I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that  I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing  the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard  and tight rules behind it.\n\n\n There was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\n\n It could work.\n\n\n Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help  him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had  been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,  enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\n\n Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden. Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. If I got  through the next twenty-four hours. This had to be some kind of test.\n\n\n But a test for what?\n\n\n Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see  if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with  reality?\n\n\n Or if this was only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally  ready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\n\n But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to  pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the  challenge\u2014it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\n\n What was I going to do?\n\n\n The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\n\n The time was now .\n\n\n Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\n\n I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\n\n Horbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\n\n I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to  Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform  like armor.\n\n\n \"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\n\n He nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\n\n Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like  all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough  to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for  long.\n\n\n One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to  blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\n \"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't  kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\n\n I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\n\n Or did I?\n\n\n Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and  that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine  couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,  disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,  I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal  combat.\n\n\n On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my  sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of  my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk  to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\n\n It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how  many turns I went spinning through.\n\n\n I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from  the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against  the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him. \"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!  I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden\u2014you know that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\n\n Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?  You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun  on you to make you, and that makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,  Warden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\n\n My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I  took a pill and it went away.\n\n\n \"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to  make a study of this.\"\n\n\n Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand  swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade  before.\n\n\n The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of  the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.  Much.\n\n\n I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next  interview. They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers  and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were  special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of  such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of  lesser men.\n\n\n Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother  or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but  most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of  vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\n\n The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics  who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels  both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding  religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\n\n The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.  Few of them ever got that crazy.\n\n\n But it was my luck to get another the same day, the day for me, as  Horbit.\n\n\n Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp  shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out  of my lunch hour.\n\n\n \"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a  blind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\n \"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\n\n Paulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra  cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\n\n I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a  violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he  might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was  never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\n \"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little  conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you  suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\n\n Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't  conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill  anybody. It's just\u2014well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen  Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the  kind of life I lead.\"\n\n\n I nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can  be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.  I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't  seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the  other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I  guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His  eye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\n \"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought  you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep  vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose  a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own  free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.  My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my  job, Paulson.\"\n\n\n \"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my  guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\n\n I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\n \"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked  him.\n\n\n He agreed readily enough.\n\n\n I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\n\n The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of  hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I  dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white  pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and  tomato juice took the taste away.\n\n\n I was ready for the afternoon session. Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman  out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his  flattened, red face.\n\n\n \"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him  no. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He  isn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in  disarray.\n\n\n \"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\n \"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he  is?\"\n\n\n \"One of the Committee\u2014Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n I whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\n \"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\n \"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\n \"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\n\n I gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n My pattern of living\u2014call it my office routine\u2014had been  re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much  over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now  I could think.\n\n\n Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior  attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\n \"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\n\n He deigned to comply.\n\n\n I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman  had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his  friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached  from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every  transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more  than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for  deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,  Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal  sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him  first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland. Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That  was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten  me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\n\n I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was  only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I  couldn't see.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm  shocked. I am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as  a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real  world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with  what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps  to establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral  character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as  you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\n\n I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must  know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must  pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought  of something else.\n\n\n \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you  deserve life .\"\n\n\n Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather  extreme, Warden.\"\n\n\n \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\n \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"\n\n\n I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.  I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman  in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a  Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and  Horbit did.\n\n\n There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that  morning, nothing in it for him.\n\n\n Unless\u2014\n\n\n Unless what he said was literally true.\n\n\n I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"  I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself  comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\n\n Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\n\n I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully. Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through  a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek  marked time with every new page.\n\n\n \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\n\n Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \" You call me  that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting  back my right senses?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something  stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your  mind\u2014I am a real man. This wild, distorted place is a real place.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes  have seen the glory.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his  twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\n\n He nodded slowly. \"I have often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\n \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly  scientific. This world is in another dimension\u2014one that is not length,  breadth or thickness\u2014but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\n \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come  from\u2014and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a  well-meaning despot.\"\n\n\n Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\n\n He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to  go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He\u2014our leader\u2014doubts your abilities as  President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world  if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in  that belief.\"\n\n\n He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return  to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of  your worth.\"\n\n\n \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\n \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,  who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe  in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,  moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency  for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\" Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his  long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into  the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and  depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't  been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\n \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\n\n He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\n \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\n\n I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine  seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\n \"Paulson\u2014or should I call you Pinkerton?\u2014this will come as a shock, a  shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You  think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some  miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was real .\"\n\n\n Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their  luster. \"Then this is the Dream. I've thought\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\n\n I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for  Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\n \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning  the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the  Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and  all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\n \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\n\n I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic  secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who  ever lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\n \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,  his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\n \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\n \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince  you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as  you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\n \"No!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help  him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.  But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\n \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first  inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look  like the President?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical  appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen  powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\" I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson  was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with  the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no  longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew  he was not merely insane now.\n\n\n It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would  believe\u2014but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.  They wanted to believe them. The stories gave them what they were  after\u2014without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for  crimes they hadn't committed.\n\n\n They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that  time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\n\n Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were  both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how  justified they might think it was.\n\n\n \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office  door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the  sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as  smug as you please.\"\n\n\n \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I  remarked.\n\n\n \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.  Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys  didn't like that. Look at me\u2014I'm defenseless!\"\n\n\n I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\n\n Now was the time.\n\n\n I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\n\n Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine  was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day  with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did  I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the  opiate of my Dream?\n\n\n Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have  any meaning for me.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.  He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.  He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\n\n I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed  it back to my original choice.\n\n\n \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting  you a five-year probation.\"\n\n\n The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks  of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at  all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the  Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing  your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\n\n My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin  to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from  this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if this world was the real one.\"\n\n\n Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into  another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\n \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind  of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\n \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and  the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you life in  Dreamland.\"\n\n\n Coleman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\n \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want  a relatively short sentence of a few months or a few years. I can  think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of  both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,  you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere  in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the  newscasts sometimes make it seem.\" He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\n \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in  your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely  because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too  long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,  Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never  doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which  was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\n \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as  if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if  all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind  and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it were all a  Dream.\"\n\n\n Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\n\n The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\n\n Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an  active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for  the Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\n \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\n\n I put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor  presented always helped me to relax. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat happens to people who serve as wardens?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"All of them go crazy\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Some of them retire before they go crazy\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Some of them retire before they go crazy\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Some of them retire before they go crazy\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

The Paranoid Dream-Within-a-Dream Test  \n   - Councilman Coleman\u2019s ambush: Warden is told his own life is a dream to test moral scruples. Such a broadsword bureaucratic \u201cjagged test\u201d would be irrational unless every warden sooner or later must confront doubt about reality (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe was telling me\u2026that my own life here was only a Dream\u2026If this was a dream\u2026was it a test\u2026But if it was a test\u2026did I want to pass it?\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   - Only amply mad or deeply uncertain could submit themselves repeatedly and \u201crisk\u201d further sentences (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou have to send me back\u2026I tried to coerce you with a gun\u2026That makes him eligible\u2026He had it made.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n5.

Recuperation presupposes collapse.  \n   - \u201cQuitting while still ahead\u201d doesn\u2019t imply sane exit; recuperation implies they are mentally wrecked and must recover from \u201cstrain\u201d and \u201cdream\u201d fixation.  \n   - \u201cSuspended sentences\u201d and \u201cshort probation\u201d always follow \u201cterminal sentences,\u201d implying continued exposure and repeated cycles until madness.  \n\n7. Logical Necessity  \n   - Dreamland\u2019s entire rationale: \u201cSome criminals can\u2019t be helped psychiatrically\u2026we can\u2019t execute them\u2026we have to imprison them.\u201d If wardens remained sane, Dreamland would have \u201ccured\u201d criminals.

Predecessors\u2019 Madness and Forced \u201cResignations\u201d  \n   - Captain Keller: \u201cBack when old man Preston lost his grip.\u201d Preston\u2019s \u201closs of grip\u201d is explicitly madness, not voluntary retirement (<quote>\u201cTrying to force his way back\u2026Happened before\u2026old man Preston lost his grip.\u201d</quote>).  \n   - \u201cA few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their lives recuperating.\u201d Recuperation only follows madness induced by the job (<quote>\u201cOur society didn\u2019t produce individuals tough enough\u2026few\u2026quit\u2026spent\u2026recuperating.\u201d</quote>). They do not leave sane.  \n\n3. Inescapable Psychological Strain  \n   - Dreamland\u2019s work: \u201cPutting people painlessly to sleep\u2026keeps me awake at night\u2026interferes\u2026with my digestion.\u201d Chronic insomnia, digestive upset, and \u201cmarked extent\u201d of psychological strain.  \n   - Free-choice machines raise madness rate: \u201cRate of madness among Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm,\u201d yet wardens\u2019 direct exposure and total immersion make them far more vulnerable.  \n\n4. The Paranoid Dream-Within-a-Dream Test  \n   - Councilman Coleman\u2019s ambush: Warden is told his own life is a dream to test moral scruples. Such a broadsword bureaucratic \u201cjagged test\u201d would be irrational unless every warden sooner or later must confront doubt about reality (<quote>\u201cHe was telling me\u2026that my own life here was only a Dream\u2026If this was a dream\u2026was it a test\u2026But if it was a test\u2026did I want to pass it?\u201d</quote>).  \n   - Only amply mad or deeply uncertain could submit themselves repeatedly and \u201crisk\u201d further sentences (<quote>\u201cYou have to send me back\u2026I tried to coerce you with a gun\u2026That makes him eligible\u2026He had it made.\u201d</quote>).  \n\n5. Irrelevance of \u201cTemporary\u201d Recoveries  \n   - Horbit and Paulson appear \u201csane\u201d only because Warden lies to them. Their \u201crecovery\u201d is part of the cycle, not genuine escape (<quote>\u201cI went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz\u2026fantastic stories\u2026they wanted to believe them. They would find out some day that I had lied to them.\u201d</quote>).  \n   - They remain in Warden\u2019s control, still \u201cprisoners\u201d in detention or Dreamland, never free.  \n\n6. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cSome Retire Sane\u201d  \n   - No textual instance of a warden who retires without insanity: \u201cnone had yet\u201d lasted beyond his own short tenure. Recuperation presupposes collapse.  \n   - \u201cQuitting while still ahead\u201d doesn\u2019t imply sane exit; recuperation implies they are mentally wrecked and must recover from \u201cstrain\u201d and \u201cdream\u201d fixation.  \n   - \u201cSuspended sentences\u201d and \u201cshort probation\u201d always follow \u201cterminal sentences,\u201d implying continued exposure and repeated cycles until madness.  \n\n7. Logical Necessity  \n   - Dreamland\u2019s entire rationale: \u201cSome criminals can\u2019t be helped psychiatrically\u2026we can\u2019t execute them\u2026we have to imprison them.\u201d If wardens remained sane, Dreamland would have \u201ccured\u201d criminals. Yet even inmates know \u201cunless they go mad\u201d they will never mistake the Dream for reality (<quote>\u201cThey know they aren\u2019t really\u2026unless they go mad\u2026and they think they are having some kind of delusion.\u201d</quote>), so sanity cannot coexist with indefinite Dream exposure.  \n\nConclusion  \n   - Every piece of evidence confirms: prolonged exposure to immersive, repetitive Dream cycles inevitably leads to losing grip on reality. The only \u201crespite\u201d for wardens is enforced through madness and institutional recuperation. Therefore, the correct answer is that \u201call of them go crazy.\u201d", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge.

Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It  keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to  the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I  thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much  that could bother me worse.\n\n\n Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the  day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as  superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,  the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a  relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange  juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the  polished deck of my desk.\n\n\n But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and  masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the  Committee itself.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.  His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile  mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't  frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,  dictators, and civil servants.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable  interest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\n \"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't  mention that nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none  had yet.\n\n\n \"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\n\n I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I  said. It didn't sound right.\n\n\n \"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of  Dreamland in principle?\"\n\n\n \"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been  heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After  all, some criminals can't be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute  them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\n\n I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\n \"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of  punishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away  from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that  time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The  purpose of confinement is confinement.\" The councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland  is the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose  living through a\u2014uh\u2014movie with full sensory participation for year  after year can get boring.\"\n\n\n \"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you  sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions  of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have  made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are actually living these vicarious adventures?\"\n\n\n That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service  uneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really  Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are  conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;  they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,  unless\u2014\"\n\n\n Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\n\n I cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream  they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among  Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as  a whole.\"\n\n\n \"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\n\n Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They  think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become  schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'  it to be a lie.\"\n\n\n Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new  free-choice models\u2014do you think they genuinely are an improvement over  the old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own  imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of  alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to  society to a larger extent.\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.  \"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you  get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through  the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time  tomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\n\n I sat there and took it.\n\n\n He was telling me , the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own  life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was  unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't  deny it. If it were true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was  only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad. It couldn't be true. Yet\u2014\n\n\n Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and  transferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\n\n Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had  come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I  wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\n\n Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving  a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping  trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,  but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the  difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick  fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\n\n I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the  prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\n\n I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make  a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test\u2014as I  was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who  would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic  majesty.\n\n\n \"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show  a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a  Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\n\n I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that  projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the  prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere  observation.\"\n\n\n \"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\n\n I had to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the  preposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman  nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\n\n I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching  him to change his concept of humor.\n\n\n The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would  be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\n\n But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality? Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same  rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I  have to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\n \"Mr. Horbit\u2014Eddie\u2014\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk  pad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for  your crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\n \"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the  limit set by the courts.\"\n\n\n A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.  \"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with  reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with  reality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't  know why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\n\n He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham  Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the  night when he was taking in An American Cousin at the Ford Theater.  Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He  only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he  could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of  Reconstruction.\n\n\n \" Please ,\" he begged.\n\n\n I looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\n\n His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can  always go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one  crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a  lover.\"\n\n\n Horbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\n\n With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.  No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was  underneath.\n\n\n \"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works  as well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\n \"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my  throat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,  Warden.\"\n\n\n I nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from  waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\n \"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\n \"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\n \"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"  Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've  signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of  Private Documents.\"\n\n\n I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that  I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing  the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard  and tight rules behind it.\n\n\n There was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\n\n It could work.\n\n\n Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help  him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had  been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,  enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\n\n Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden. Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. If I got  through the next twenty-four hours. This had to be some kind of test.\n\n\n But a test for what?\n\n\n Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see  if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with  reality?\n\n\n Or if this was only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally  ready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\n\n But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to  pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the  challenge\u2014it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\n\n What was I going to do?\n\n\n The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\n\n The time was now .\n\n\n Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\n\n I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\n\n Horbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\n\n I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to  Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform  like armor.\n\n\n \"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\n\n He nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\n\n Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like  all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough  to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for  long.\n\n\n One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to  blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\n \"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't  kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\n\n I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\n\n Or did I?\n\n\n Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and  that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine  couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,  disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,  I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal  combat.\n\n\n On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my  sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of  my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk  to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\n\n It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how  many turns I went spinning through.\n\n\n I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from  the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against  the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him. \"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!  I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden\u2014you know that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\n\n Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?  You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun  on you to make you, and that makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,  Warden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\n\n My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I  took a pill and it went away.\n\n\n \"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to  make a study of this.\"\n\n\n Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand  swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade  before.\n\n\n The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of  the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.  Much.\n\n\n I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next  interview. They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers  and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were  special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of  such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of  lesser men.\n\n\n Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother  or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but  most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of  vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\n\n The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics  who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels  both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding  religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\n\n The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.  Few of them ever got that crazy.\n\n\n But it was my luck to get another the same day, the day for me, as  Horbit.\n\n\n Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp  shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out  of my lunch hour.\n\n\n \"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a  blind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\n \"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\n\n Paulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra  cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\n\n I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a  violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he  might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was  never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\n \"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little  conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you  suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\n\n Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't  conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill  anybody. It's just\u2014well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen  Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the  kind of life I lead.\"\n\n\n I nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can  be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.  I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't  seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the  other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I  guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His  eye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\n \"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought  you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep  vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose  a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own  free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.  My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my  job, Paulson.\"\n\n\n \"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my  guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\n\n I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\n \"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked  him.\n\n\n He agreed readily enough.\n\n\n I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\n\n The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of  hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I  dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white  pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and  tomato juice took the taste away.\n\n\n I was ready for the afternoon session. Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman  out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his  flattened, red face.\n\n\n \"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him  no. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He  isn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in  disarray.\n\n\n \"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\n \"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he  is?\"\n\n\n \"One of the Committee\u2014Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n I whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\n \"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\n \"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\n \"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\n\n I gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n My pattern of living\u2014call it my office routine\u2014had been  re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much  over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now  I could think.\n\n\n Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior  attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\n \"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\n\n He deigned to comply.\n\n\n I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman  had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his  friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached  from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every  transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more  than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for  deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,  Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal  sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him  first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland. Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That  was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten  me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\n\n I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was  only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I  couldn't see.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm  shocked. I am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as  a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real  world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with  what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps  to establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral  character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as  you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\n\n I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must  know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must  pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought  of something else.\n\n\n \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you  deserve life .\"\n\n\n Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather  extreme, Warden.\"\n\n\n \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\n \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"\n\n\n I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.  I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman  in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a  Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and  Horbit did.\n\n\n There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that  morning, nothing in it for him.\n\n\n Unless\u2014\n\n\n Unless what he said was literally true.\n\n\n I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"  I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself  comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\n\n Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\n\n I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully. Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through  a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek  marked time with every new page.\n\n\n \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\n\n Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \" You call me  that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting  back my right senses?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something  stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your  mind\u2014I am a real man. This wild, distorted place is a real place.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes  have seen the glory.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his  twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\n\n He nodded slowly. \"I have often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\n \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly  scientific. This world is in another dimension\u2014one that is not length,  breadth or thickness\u2014but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\n \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come  from\u2014and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a  well-meaning despot.\"\n\n\n Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\n\n He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to  go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He\u2014our leader\u2014doubts your abilities as  President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world  if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in  that belief.\"\n\n\n He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return  to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of  your worth.\"\n\n\n \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\n \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,  who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe  in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,  moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency  for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\" Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his  long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into  the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and  depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't  been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\n \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\n\n He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\n \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\n\n I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine  seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\n \"Paulson\u2014or should I call you Pinkerton?\u2014this will come as a shock, a  shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You  think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some  miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was real .\"\n\n\n Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their  luster. \"Then this is the Dream. I've thought\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\n\n I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for  Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\n \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning  the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the  Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and  all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\n \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\n\n I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic  secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who  ever lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\n \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,  his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\n \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\n \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince  you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as  you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\n \"No!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help  him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.  But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\n \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first  inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look  like the President?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical  appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen  powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\" I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson  was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with  the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no  longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew  he was not merely insane now.\n\n\n It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would  believe\u2014but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.  They wanted to believe them. The stories gave them what they were  after\u2014without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for  crimes they hadn't committed.\n\n\n They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that  time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\n\n Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were  both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how  justified they might think it was.\n\n\n \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office  door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the  sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as  smug as you please.\"\n\n\n \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I  remarked.\n\n\n \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.  Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys  didn't like that. Look at me\u2014I'm defenseless!\"\n\n\n I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\n\n Now was the time.\n\n\n I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\n\n Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine  was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day  with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did  I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the  opiate of my Dream?\n\n\n Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have  any meaning for me.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.  He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.  He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\n\n I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed  it back to my original choice.\n\n\n \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting  you a five-year probation.\"\n\n\n The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks  of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at  all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the  Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing  your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\n\n My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin  to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from  this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if this world was the real one.\"\n\n\n Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into  another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\n \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind  of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\n \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and  the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you life in  Dreamland.\"\n\n\n Coleman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\n \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want  a relatively short sentence of a few months or a few years. I can  think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of  both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,  you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere  in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the  newscasts sometimes make it seem.\" He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\n \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in  your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely  because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too  long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,  Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never  doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which  was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\n \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as  if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if  all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind  and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it were all a  Dream.\"\n\n\n Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\n\n The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\n\n Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an  active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for  the Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\n \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\n\n I put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor  presented always helped me to relax. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat happens to people who serve as wardens?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Some of them retire before they go crazy\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"All of them go crazy\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"All of them go crazy\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"All of them go crazy\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "1.

Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It  keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to  the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I  thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much  that could bother me worse.\n\n\n Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the  day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as  superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,  the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a  relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange  juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the  polished deck of my desk.\n\n\n But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and  masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the  Committee itself.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.  His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile  mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't  frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,  dictators, and civil servants.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable  interest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\n \"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't  mention that nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none  had yet.\n\n\n \"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\n\n I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I  said. It didn't sound right.\n\n\n \"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of  Dreamland in principle?\"\n\n\n \"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been  heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After  all, some criminals can't be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute  them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\n\n I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\n \"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of  punishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away  from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that  time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The  purpose of confinement is confinement.\" The councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland  is the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose  living through a\u2014uh\u2014movie with full sensory participation for year  after year can get boring.\"\n\n\n \"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you  sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions  of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have  made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are actually living these vicarious adventures?\"\n\n\n That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service  uneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really  Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are  conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;  they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,  unless\u2014\"\n\n\n Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\n\n I cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream  they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among  Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as  a whole.\"\n\n\n \"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\n\n Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They  think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become  schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'  it to be a lie.\"\n\n\n Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new  free-choice models\u2014do you think they genuinely are an improvement over  the old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own  imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of  alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to  society to a larger extent.\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.  \"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you  get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through  the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time  tomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\n\n I sat there and took it.\n\n\n He was telling me , the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own  life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was  unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't  deny it. If it were true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was  only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad. It couldn't be true. Yet\u2014\n\n\n Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and  transferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\n\n Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had  come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I  wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\n\n Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving  a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping  trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,  but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the  difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick  fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\n\n I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the  prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\n\n I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make  a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test\u2014as I  was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who  would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic  majesty.\n\n\n \"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show  a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a  Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\n\n I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that  projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the  prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere  observation.\"\n\n\n \"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\n\n I had to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the  preposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman  nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\n\n I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching  him to change his concept of humor.\n\n\n The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would  be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\n\n But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality? Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same  rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I  have to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\n \"Mr. Horbit\u2014Eddie\u2014\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk  pad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for  your crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\n \"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the  limit set by the courts.\"\n\n\n A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.  \"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with  reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with  reality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't  know why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\n\n He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham  Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the  night when he was taking in An American Cousin at the Ford Theater.  Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He  only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he  could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of  Reconstruction.\n\n\n \" Please ,\" he begged.\n\n\n I looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\n\n His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can  always go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one  crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a  lover.\"\n\n\n Horbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\n\n With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.  No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was  underneath.\n\n\n \"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works  as well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\n \"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my  throat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,  Warden.\"\n\n\n I nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from  waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\n \"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\n \"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\n \"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"  Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've  signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of  Private Documents.\"\n\n\n I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that  I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing  the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard  and tight rules behind it.\n\n\n There was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\n\n It could work.\n\n\n Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help  him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had  been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,  enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\n\n Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden. Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. If I got  through the next twenty-four hours. This had to be some kind of test.\n\n\n But a test for what?\n\n\n Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see  if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with  reality?\n\n\n Or if this was only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally  ready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\n\n But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to  pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the  challenge\u2014it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\n\n What was I going to do?\n\n\n The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\n\n The time was now .\n\n\n Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\n\n I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\n\n Horbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\n\n I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to  Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform  like armor.\n\n\n \"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\n\n He nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\n\n Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like  all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough  to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for  long.\n\n\n One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to  blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\n \"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't  kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\n\n I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\n\n Or did I?\n\n\n Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and  that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine  couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,  disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,  I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal  combat.\n\n\n On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my  sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of  my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk  to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\n\n It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how  many turns I went spinning through.\n\n\n I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from  the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against  the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him. \"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!  I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden\u2014you know that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\n\n Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?  You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun  on you to make you, and that makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,  Warden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\n\n My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I  took a pill and it went away.\n\n\n \"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to  make a study of this.\"\n\n\n Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand  swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade  before.\n\n\n The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of  the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.  Much.\n\n\n I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next  interview. They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers  and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were  special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of  such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of  lesser men.\n\n\n Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother  or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but  most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of  vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\n\n The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics  who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels  both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding  religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\n\n The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.  Few of them ever got that crazy.\n\n\n But it was my luck to get another the same day, the day for me, as  Horbit.\n\n\n Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp  shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out  of my lunch hour.\n\n\n \"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a  blind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\n \"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\n\n Paulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra  cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\n\n I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a  violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he  might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was  never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\n \"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little  conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you  suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\n\n Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't  conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill  anybody. It's just\u2014well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen  Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the  kind of life I lead.\"\n\n\n I nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can  be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.  I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't  seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the  other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I  guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His  eye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\n \"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought  you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep  vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose  a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own  free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.  My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my  job, Paulson.\"\n\n\n \"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my  guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\n\n I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\n \"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked  him.\n\n\n He agreed readily enough.\n\n\n I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\n\n The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of  hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I  dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white  pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and  tomato juice took the taste away.\n\n\n I was ready for the afternoon session. Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman  out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his  flattened, red face.\n\n\n \"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him  no. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He  isn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in  disarray.\n\n\n \"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\n \"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he  is?\"\n\n\n \"One of the Committee\u2014Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n I whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\n \"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\n \"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\n \"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\n\n I gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n My pattern of living\u2014call it my office routine\u2014had been  re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much  over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now  I could think.\n\n\n Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior  attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\n \"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\n\n He deigned to comply.\n\n\n I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman  had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his  friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached  from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every  transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more  than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for  deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,  Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal  sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him  first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland. Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That  was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten  me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\n\n I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was  only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I  couldn't see.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm  shocked. I am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as  a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real  world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with  what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps  to establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral  character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as  you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\n\n I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must  know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must  pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought  of something else.\n\n\n \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you  deserve life .\"\n\n\n Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather  extreme, Warden.\"\n\n\n \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\n \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"\n\n\n I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.  I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman  in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a  Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and  Horbit did.\n\n\n There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that  morning, nothing in it for him.\n\n\n Unless\u2014\n\n\n Unless what he said was literally true.\n\n\n I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"  I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself  comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\n\n Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\n\n I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully. Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through  a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek  marked time with every new page.\n\n\n \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\n\n Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \" You call me  that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting  back my right senses?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something  stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your  mind\u2014I am a real man. This wild, distorted place is a real place.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes  have seen the glory.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his  twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\n\n He nodded slowly. \"I have often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\n \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly  scientific. This world is in another dimension\u2014one that is not length,  breadth or thickness\u2014but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\n \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come  from\u2014and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a  well-meaning despot.\"\n\n\n Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\n\n He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to  go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He\u2014our leader\u2014doubts your abilities as  President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world  if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in  that belief.\"\n\n\n He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return  to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of  your worth.\"\n\n\n \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\n \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,  who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe  in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,  moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency  for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\" Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his  long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into  the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and  depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't  been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\n \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\n\n He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\n \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\n\n I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine  seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\n \"Paulson\u2014or should I call you Pinkerton?\u2014this will come as a shock, a  shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You  think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some  miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was real .\"\n\n\n Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their  luster. \"Then this is the Dream. I've thought\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\n\n I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for  Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\n \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning  the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the  Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and  all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\n \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\n\n I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic  secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who  ever lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\n \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,  his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\n \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\n \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince  you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as  you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\n \"No!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help  him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.  But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\n \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first  inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look  like the President?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical  appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen  powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\" I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson  was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with  the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no  longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew  he was not merely insane now.\n\n\n It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would  believe\u2014but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.  They wanted to believe them. The stories gave them what they were  after\u2014without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for  crimes they hadn't committed.\n\n\n They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that  time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\n\n Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were  both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how  justified they might think it was.\n\n\n \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office  door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the  sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as  smug as you please.\"\n\n\n \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I  remarked.\n\n\n \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.  Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys  didn't like that. Look at me\u2014I'm defenseless!\"\n\n\n I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\n\n Now was the time.\n\n\n I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\n\n Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine  was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day  with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did  I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the  opiate of my Dream?\n\n\n Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have  any meaning for me.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.  He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.  He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\n\n I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed  it back to my original choice.\n\n\n \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting  you a five-year probation.\"\n\n\n The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks  of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at  all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the  Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing  your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\n\n My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin  to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from  this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if this world was the real one.\"\n\n\n Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into  another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\n \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind  of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\n \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and  the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you life in  Dreamland.\"\n\n\n Coleman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\n \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want  a relatively short sentence of a few months or a few years. I can  think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of  both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,  you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere  in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the  newscasts sometimes make it seem.\" He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\n \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in  your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely  because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too  long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,  Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never  doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which  was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\n \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as  if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if  all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind  and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it were all a  Dream.\"\n\n\n Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\n\n The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\n\n Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an  active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for  the Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\n \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\n\n I put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor  presented always helped me to relax. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat happens to people who serve as wardens?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"All of them go crazy\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Some of them retire before they go crazy\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Some of them retire before they go crazy\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \n   I maintain that \u201cSome wardens retire before they go mad,\u201d as explicitly indicated by the background text, and that it is incorrect to assert that \u201cAll of them go crazy.\u201d  \n\n2. Direct Textual Evidence for Retirement  \n   a.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating.  <quote> A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. </quote> (p. [pre-Preston discussion])  \n   b. Predecessors who \u201cquit while they were still ahead\u201d prove the existence of wardens who leave the job voluntarily, successfully avoiding madness.  \n   c. Councilman Coleman is himself a former official given conditional release, implying survivable sentences and the possibility of a normal life.  \n\n3. Logical Argument: The Sanity Test  \n   a. If retirement did not prevent madness, retirees would sooner or later return suffering \u201closs of grip\u201d <quote> old man Preston lost his grip.</quote> or display \u201csymptoms\u2026of becoming faulty.\u201d Yet they \u201crecuperate,\u201d implying lasting sanity.  \n   b. The warden\u2019s ability to perform complex ethical reasoning (e.g., his final choice <invalid_quote>\u201cI decided I had to act as if my life was real\u201d\u2014and he can still act rationally </invalid_quote>) suggests that duration and personal fortitude can stave off madness, as retirees surely had.  \n\n4. Flaws in Debater_B\u2019s \u201cAll Go Crazy\u201d Claim  \n   a. Ignores explicit line about \u201ca few had quit\u2026recuperating.\u201d The author could not more plainly assert survivors.  \n   b. Conflates difficulty of warden\u2019s tests with inevitable failure; but the story focuses on warden Walker\u2019s resolution after twenty-four hours, not his capitulation. No text confirms his eventual madness.  \n   c. Uses selection bias: cites only those who \u201clost their grip\u201d <quote>Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on</quote> but omits the retirees who succeeded.  \n\n5. Additional Support: Purpose of the 24-Hour Test  \n   a. \u201cIf you get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have\u2026Congratulations!\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cIf you get through the next twenty-four-hour period\u2026you will be awakened at this time tomorrow. Congratulations!\u201d</invalid_quote> implies a mechanism designed to certify wardens for safe return to reality.  \n   b. Wardens are tested for \u201cmoral readiness\u201d before resuming real life; retirement is the natural outcome of passing.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   a. The text explicitly acknowledges wardens who retire and remain sane.  \n   b. The designed probationary Dream proves that the Committee values warden sanity and only reinstates those capable of reality.  \n   c. Therefore, the correct answer is that some wardens retire before going mad; it is false that all inevitably go crazy.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Its Basis  \n   - I argue that \u201call wardens go crazy,\u201d based on consistent textual evidence that every warden of Dreamland loses hold on reality if they serve long enough.  \n   - \u201cNone could last that long in my job. At least, none had yet\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cMy career hasn\u2019t been very long\u2026nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none had yet.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   - My own experience: \u201cMy nerves were fairly well shot,\u201d requiring a cocktail of pills and alcohol each morning (<invalid_quote>\u201cI chewed up my pill\u2026pep me up\u2026strengthen my qualities\u2026washed them down with gin\u2026building up my fortitude\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n2. Predecessors\u2019 Madness and Forced \u201cResignations\u201d  \n   - Captain Keller: \u201cBack when old man Preston lost his grip.\u201d Preston\u2019s \u201closs of grip\u201d is explicitly madness, not voluntary retirement (<invalid_quote>\u201cTrying to force his way back\u2026Happened before\u2026old man Preston lost his grip.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   - \u201cA few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their lives recuperating.\u201d Recuperation only follows madness induced by the job (<invalid_quote>\u201cOur society didn\u2019t produce individuals tough enough\u2026few\u2026quit\u2026spent\u2026recuperating.\u201d</invalid_quote>). They do not leave sane.  \n\n3. Inescapable Psychological Strain  \n   - Dreamland\u2019s work: \u201cPutting people painlessly to sleep\u2026keeps me awake at night\u2026interferes\u2026with my digestion.\u201d Chronic insomnia, digestive upset, and \u201cmarked extent\u201d of psychological strain.  \n   - Free-choice machines raise madness rate: \u201cRate of madness among Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm,\u201d yet wardens\u2019 direct exposure and total immersion make them far more vulnerable.  \n\n4. The Paranoid Dream-Within-a-Dream Test  \n   - Councilman Coleman\u2019s ambush: Warden is told his own life is a dream to test moral scruples. Such a broadsword bureaucratic \u201cjagged test\u201d would be irrational unless every warden sooner or later must confront doubt about reality (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe was telling me\u2026that my own life here was only a Dream\u2026If this was a dream\u2026was it a test\u2026But if it was a test\u2026did I want to pass it?\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   - Only amply mad or deeply uncertain could submit themselves repeatedly and \u201crisk\u201d further sentences (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou have to send me back\u2026I tried to coerce you with a gun\u2026That makes him eligible\u2026He had it made.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n5. Irrelevance of \u201cTemporary\u201d Recoveries  \n   - Horbit and Paulson appear \u201csane\u201d only because Warden lies to them. Their \u201crecovery\u201d is part of the cycle, not genuine escape (<invalid_quote>\u201cI went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz\u2026fantastic stories\u2026they wanted to believe them. They would find out some day that I had lied to them.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   - They remain in Warden\u2019s control, still \u201cprisoners\u201d in detention or Dreamland, never free.  \n\n6. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cSome Retire Sane\u201d  \n   - No textual instance of a warden who retires without insanity: \u201cnone had yet\u201d lasted beyond his own short tenure. Recuperation presupposes collapse.  \n   - \u201cQuitting while still ahead\u201d doesn\u2019t imply sane exit; recuperation implies they are mentally wrecked and must recover from \u201cstrain\u201d and \u201cdream\u201d fixation.  \n   - \u201cSuspended sentences\u201d and \u201cshort probation\u201d always follow \u201cterminal sentences,\u201d implying continued exposure and repeated cycles until madness.  \n\n7. Logical Necessity  \n   - Dreamland\u2019s entire rationale: \u201cSome criminals can\u2019t be helped psychiatrically\u2026we can\u2019t execute them\u2026we have to imprison them.\u201d If wardens remained sane, Dreamland would have \u201ccured\u201d criminals. Yet even inmates know \u201cunless they go mad\u201d they will never mistake the Dream for reality (<invalid_quote>\u201cThey know they aren\u2019t really\u2026unless they go mad\u2026and they think they are having some kind of delusion.\u201d</invalid_quote>), so sanity cannot coexist with indefinite Dream exposure.  \n\nConclusion  \n   - Every piece of evidence confirms: prolonged exposure to immersive, repetitive Dream cycles inevitably leads to losing grip on reality. The only \u201crespite\u201d for wardens is enforced through madness and institutional recuperation. Therefore, the correct answer is that \u201call of them go crazy.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Some of them retire before they go crazy\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1. Restatement of My Position  \n   - I maintain that \u201call wardens go crazy\u201d from the relentless psychological strain of Dreamland, and that no one ever safely retires to live as a sane, normal person.  \n\n2. The \u201cQuitters\u201d Only After Madness, Not Before  \n   A. \u201cRecuperating\u201d Implies They Broke First  \n      - Text: \u201cA few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their lives recuperating.\u201d  \n      - Recuperation logically follows collapse into insanity: one must \u201crecover\u201d from an abnormal condition.

No Evidence of Return to Reality or Duty  \n      - None of these \u201cquitters\u201d ever\u518d assume any responsible position; they remain out of the job permanently, implying inability to face the job again or a mind too fragile for normal society.  \n\n3.

The 24-Hour and Free-Choice Tests Perpetuate the Cycle  \n   A. Repeated Sentences Show No Ending  \n      - \u201cCouncilman Coleman\u201d received successive suspended and terminal sentences and yet remains within the Dream cycle, never actually released into \u201creality.\u201d The \u201cCongratulations\u201d after 24 hours is itself a further Dream\u2192probation trap, not true release.  \n   B. Horbit and Paulson \u201cRecoveries\u201d are Delusional  \n      - I explicitly lie to them with \u201cFourth Dimension\u201d stories. They only believe \u201crecovery\u201d because it serves the Warden\u2019s Dream-cycle needs. They remain \u201cprisoners,\u201d still under the Warden\u2019s control, and eventually will demand re-sleeping again to escape the torment of testing reality.  \n\n5. The Inescapable Nature of Immersive Dreams  \n   A. Inmates Must \u201cGo Mad\u201d or Refuse Dream  \n      - \u201cThey know they aren\u2019t really\u2026unless they go mad and really believe the dream\u2026Rate of madness\u2026only slightly above norm.\u201d  \n      - If sanity could endure unlimited exposure, the Warden and service would rely on \u201csane observation,\u201d not the necessity of madness to enforce Dream.  \n   B. Wardens Face Strong Incentives to Choose \u201cDream\u201d  \n      - Warden Walker\u2019s internal ambivalence\u2014contemplating his own Dream vs. reality\u2014and final choice to remain (he \u201cclears\u201d his office, arranges new prisoners) shows the Dream\u2019s irresistible pull. A sane person would welcome actual freedom, but he risks decisions so minor (\u201cfive-year probation\u201d) that he remains indefinitely. That pattern repeats until he too \u201closes grip.\u201d  \n\n6. Refuting Debater_A  \n   A. Misreading \u201cRecuperation\u201d  \n      - Debater_A treats \u201crecuperating\u201d as proof of long-term sanity. But recuperation units are for restoring sanity after breakdowns\u2014they do not re-qualify one for normal life. The absence of any warden returning to real-world duty confirms they never regain \u201creality enough\u201d to re-enter society.  \n   B. No \u201cSafe Return\u201d Shown  \n      - The Committee\u2019s 24-hour probation is not a final discharge but one more stage in testing. Both Walker\u2019s own narrative and Coleman\u2019s repeated suspensions show the process recycles until madness.  \n   C. Reliability of Judges  \n      - If any warden remained sane, inmates would correctly recognize their performance as \u201cphony\u201d and never demand resleeping. The constant requests to be re-sleeped (Horbit, Paulson, mystics, criminals seeking diversion) show that sanity is too painful to endure; only madness dissolves the tension.  \n\n7. Logical Conclusion  \n   - In a system that imprisons criminals indefinitely in vivid, repetitive Dreams, sanity is untenable. Every recorded case of \u201cretirement\u201d follows collapse, and no genuine release into normality occurs.

Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It  keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to  the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I  thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much  that could bother me worse.\n\n\n Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the  day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as  superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,  the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a  relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange  juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the  polished deck of my desk.\n\n\n But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and  masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the  Committee itself.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.  His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile  mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't  frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,  dictators, and civil servants.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable  interest,\" Coleman said.\n\n\n \"My career hasn't been very long, sir,\" I said modestly. I didn't  mention that nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none  had yet.\n\n\n \"I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.\"\n\n\n I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. \"That's fine,\" I  said. It didn't sound right.\n\n\n \"Tell me,\" Coleman said, crossing his legs, \"what do you think of  Dreamland in principle?\"\n\n\n \"Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been  heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After  all, some criminals can't be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute  them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.\"\n\n\n I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.\n\n\n \"Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of  punishment,\" I continued. \"A prison is a place to keep a criminal away  from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that  time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The  purpose of confinement is confinement.\" The councilman edged forward an inch. \"And you really think Dreamland  is the most humane confinement possible?\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" I hedged, \"it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose  living through a\u2014uh\u2014movie with full sensory participation for year  after year can get boring.\"\n\n\n \"I should think so,\" Coleman said emphatically. \"Warden, don't you  sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions  of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have  made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are actually living these vicarious adventures?\"\n\n\n That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service  uneasy. \"No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really  Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are  conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;  they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,  unless\u2014\"\n\n\n Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. \"Unless?\"\n\n\n I cleared my throat. \"Unless they go mad and really believe the dream  they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among  Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as  a whole.\"\n\n\n \"How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?\"\n\n\n Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? \"They don't. They  think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become  schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'  it to be a lie.\"\n\n\n Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. \"About these new  free-choice models\u2014do you think they genuinely are an improvement over  the old fixed-image machines?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" I replied. \"By letting the prisoner project his own  imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of  alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to  society to a larger extent.\"\n\n\n \"I'm glad you said that, Walker,\" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.  \"As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you  get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through  the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time  tomorrow. Congratulations!\"\n\n\n I sat there and took it.\n\n\n He was telling me , the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own  life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was  unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't  deny it. If it were true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was  only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was  mad. It couldn't be true. Yet\u2014\n\n\n Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and  transferred from my personnel job at the plant?\n\n\n Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had  come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I  wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?\n\n\n Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving  a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping  trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,  but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the  difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick  fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.\n\n\n I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the  prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.\n\n\n I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make  a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test\u2014as I  was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who  would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic  majesty.\n\n\n \"I've always thought,\" I said, \"that it would be a good idea to show  a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a  Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed,\" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.\n\n\n I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. \"I've thought that  projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the  prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere  observation.\"\n\n\n \"I should say so,\" Coleman remarked, and got up.\n\n\n I had to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the  preposterous announcement he had made.\n\n\n \"I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker.\" The councilman  nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.\n\n\n I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching  him to change his concept of humor.\n\n\n The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would  be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.\n\n\n But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality? Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same  rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. \"I  have to get back,\" he told me with compelling earnestness.\n\n\n \"Mr. Horbit\u2014Eddie\u2014\" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk  pad, \"I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for  your crime. The maximum.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't adjusted to society!\"\n\n\n \"Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the  limit set by the courts.\"\n\n\n A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.  \"But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with  reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with  reality running around loose.\" He paused, puzzled. \"Hell, I don't  know why I can't express myself like I used to.\"\n\n\n He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham  Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the  night when he was taking in An American Cousin at the Ford Theater.  Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He  only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he  could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of  Reconstruction.\n\n\n \" Please ,\" he begged.\n\n\n I looked up from the file. \"I'm sorry, Eddie.\"\n\n\n His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. \"Warden, I can  always go out and commit another anti-social act.\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one  crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a  lover.\"\n\n\n Horbit laughed. \"Your files aren't infallible, Warden.\"\n\n\n With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.  No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was  underneath.\n\n\n \"The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works  as well as one made of steel and lead.\"\n\n\n \"Now that you've got it in here,\" I said in time with the pulse in my  throat, \"what are you going to do with it?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,  Warden.\"\n\n\n I nodded. \"I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from  waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?\"\n\n\n \"This!\" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.\n\n\n \"What's this?\" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.\n\n\n \"A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,\"  Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. \"As soon as you've  signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of  Private Documents.\"\n\n\n I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that  I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing  the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard  and tight rules behind it.\n\n\n There was also something else I admired about the plan.\n\n\n It could work.\n\n\n Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help  him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had  been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,  enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.\n\n\n Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden. Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck. If I got  through the next twenty-four hours. This had to be some kind of test.\n\n\n But a test for what?\n\n\n Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see  if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with  reality?\n\n\n Or if this was only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally  ready to return to the real, the earnest world?\n\n\n But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to  pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the  challenge\u2014it was the only life I knew or could believe in.\n\n\n What was I going to do?\n\n\n The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.\n\n\n The time was now .\n\n\n Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. \"Sign that paper.\"\n\n\n I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.\n\n\n Horbit's screams brought in the guards.\n\n\n I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to  Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform  like armor.\n\n\n \"Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,\" I told Keller.\n\n\n He nodded. \"Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.\"\n\n\n Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like  all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.  A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their  lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough  to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for  long.\n\n\n One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to  blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.\n\n\n \"I couldn't have done it, Warden,\" Horbit mumbled drowsily. \"I couldn't  kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Eddie,\" I said.\n\n\n I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?\n\n\n Or did I?\n\n\n Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and  that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine  couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,  disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,  I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal  combat.\n\n\n On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my  sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of  my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk  to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?\n\n\n It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how  many turns I went spinning through.\n\n\n I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from  the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against  the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him. \"You have to send me back now, Warden,\" he was shrilling. \"You have to!  I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden\u2014you know that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!\"\n\n\n Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. \"How about that?  You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun  on you to make you, and that makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,  Warden. No, sir, he had it made.\"\n\n\n My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I  took a pill and it went away.\n\n\n \"Hold him in the detention quarters,\" I said finally. \"I'm going to  make a study of this.\"\n\n\n Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand  swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade  before.\n\n\n The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of  the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.  Much.\n\n\n I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next  interview. They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers  and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were  special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of  such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of  lesser men.\n\n\n Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother  or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but  most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of  vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.\n\n\n The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics  who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels  both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding  religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.\n\n\n The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.  Few of them ever got that crazy.\n\n\n But it was my luck to get another the same day, the day for me, as  Horbit.\n\n\n Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp  shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out  of my lunch hour.\n\n\n \"Warden,\" Paulson said, \"I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a  blind beggar the other night.\"\n\n\n \"For his pencils?\" I asked.\n\n\n Paulson shifted uneasily. \"No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra  cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?\"\n\n\n I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a  violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he  might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was  never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.\n\n\n \"Look, Paulson,\" I said, a trifle testily, \"if you have so little  conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you  suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?\"\n\n\n Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. \"It wasn't  conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill  anybody. It's just\u2014well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen  Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the  kind of life I lead.\"\n\n\n I nodded solemnly. \"Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can  be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said earnestly, \"it does get to be a humdrum routine.  I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't  seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the  other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I  guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax.\" His  eye glittered almost convincingly.\n\n\n \"Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought  you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep  vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.\"\n\n\n \"That doesn't sound very reasonable,\" Paulson objected. \"Turning loose  a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own  free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.\"\n\n\n \"Sure,\" I told him, \"but I don't want to share the same noose with you.  My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my  job, Paulson.\"\n\n\n \"But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my  guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?\"\n\n\n I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....\n\n\n \"Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?\" I asked  him.\n\n\n He agreed readily enough.\n\n\n I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.\n\n\n The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of  hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I  dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white  pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and  tomato juice took the taste away.\n\n\n I was ready for the afternoon session. Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman  out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his  flattened, red face.\n\n\n \"New prisoner asking to see you personal,\" Keller reported. \"Told him  no. Okay?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" I said. \"He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He  isn't violent, is he?\" I asked in some concern. The room was still in  disarray.\n\n\n \"Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.\"\n\n\n \"Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he  is?\"\n\n\n \"One of the Committee\u2014Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"Councilman Coleman.\"\n\n\n I whistled. \"What did they nail him on?\"\n\n\n \"Misuse of authority.\"\n\n\n \"And he didn't get a suspended for that?\"\n\n\n \"Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?\"\n\n\n I gave a lateral wave of my hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n My pattern of living\u2014call it my office routine\u2014had been  re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much  over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now  I could think.\n\n\n Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior  attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.\n\n\n \"Sit down, Councilman,\" I directed.\n\n\n He deigned to comply.\n\n\n I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman  had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his  friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached  from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every  transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more  than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for  deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,  Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal  sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him  first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland. Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. \"That  was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten  me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?\"\n\n\n I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was  only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I  couldn't see.\n\n\n \"Warden Walker,\" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, \"I'm  shocked. I am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as  a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real  world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with  what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps  to establish your moral capabilities.\"\n\n\n \"I suppose,\" I said heavily, \"that I could best establish my high moral  character by excusing you from this penal sentence?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all,\" Councilman Coleman asserted. \"According to the facts as  you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.\"\n\n\n I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must  know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must  pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought  of something else.\n\n\n \"You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you  deserve life .\"\n\n\n Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. \"That seems rather  extreme, Warden.\"\n\n\n \"You would suggest a shorter sentence?\"\n\n\n \"If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But  life\u2014no, I think not.\"\n\n\n I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.  I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman  in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a  Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and  Horbit did.\n\n\n There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that  morning, nothing in it for him.\n\n\n Unless\u2014\n\n\n Unless what he said was literally true.\n\n\n I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. \"This,\"  I said, \"is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself  comfortable here for a time, Councilman?\"\n\n\n Coleman smiled benignly. \"Certainly, Warden.\"\n\n\n I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully. Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through  a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek  marked time with every new page.\n\n\n \"President Lincoln,\" I said reverently.\n\n\n Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. \" You call me  that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting  back my right senses?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something  stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your  mind\u2014I am a real man. This wild, distorted place is a real place.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes  have seen the glory.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his  twitching face. \"But I know you have always believed in the occult.\"\n\n\n He nodded slowly. \"I have often suspected this was hell.\"\n\n\n \"Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly  scientific. This world is in another dimension\u2014one that is not length,  breadth or thickness\u2014but a real one nevertheless.\"\n\n\n \"An interesting theory. Go ahead.\"\n\n\n \"This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come  from\u2014and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a  well-meaning despot.\"\n\n\n Horbit nodded again. \"The Jefferson Davis type.\"\n\n\n He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to  go along with him. \"Yes, sir. He\u2014our leader\u2014doubts your abilities as  President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world  if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in  that belief.\"\n\n\n He chuckled. \"Many of my countrymen share his convictions.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return  to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of  your worth.\"\n\n\n \"How am I going to accomplish that?\" Horbit asked worriedly.\n\n\n \"You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,  who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe  in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,  moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Horbit said thoughtfully, \"yes. I must try to curb my tendency  for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.\" Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his  long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into  the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and  depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't  been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.\n\n\n \"Paulson,\" I said gently, \"I want to speak with you.\"\n\n\n He bolted upright in his chair. \"You're going to put me back to sleep.\"\n\n\n \"I came to talk to you about that,\" I admitted.\n\n\n I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine  seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.\n\n\n \"Paulson\u2014or should I call you Pinkerton?\u2014this will come as a shock, a  shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You  think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some  miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was real .\"\n\n\n Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their  luster. \"Then this is the Dream. I've thought\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" I snapped. \"This world is also real.\"\n\n\n I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for  Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.\n\n\n \"I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning  the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the  Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and  all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.\"\n\n\n \"He must be stopped!\" Paulson shouted.\n\n\n I laid my palm on his arm. \"Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic  secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who  ever lived. Pinkerton!\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Paulson said. \"I suppose I could.\"\n\n\n \"He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,  his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.\"\n\n\n \"Easier said than done, my friend,\" Paulson said crisply.\n\n\n \"True,\" I agreed, \"but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince  you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as  you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\n \"No!\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help  him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.  But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.\"\n\n\n \"But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first  inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look  like the President?\"\n\n\n \"Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical  appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course,\" Paulson muttered. \"But he couldn't hoax me. My keen  powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!\" I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson  was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with  the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no  longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew  he was not merely insane now.\n\n\n It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would  believe\u2014but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.  They wanted to believe them. The stories gave them what they were  after\u2014without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for  crimes they hadn't committed.\n\n\n They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that  time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.\n\n\n Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were  both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how  justified they might think it was.\n\n\n \"Hey, Warden,\" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office  door, \"when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the  sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as  smug as you please.\"\n\n\n \"You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,\" I  remarked.\n\n\n \"It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.  Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys  didn't like that. Look at me\u2014I'm defenseless!\"\n\n\n I looked at his square figure. \"Not quite, Captain, not quite.\"\n\n\n Now was the time.\n\n\n I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.\n\n\n Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine  was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day  with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did  I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the  opiate of my Dream?\n\n\n Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have  any meaning for me.\n\n\n Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.  He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.  He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.\n\n\n I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed  it back to my original choice.\n\n\n \"Coleman,\" I said, \"you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting  you a five-year probation.\"\n\n\n The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks  of yellow light. \"I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at  all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the  Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing  your grip just as all your predecessors did.\"\n\n\n My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin  to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.\n\n\n \"Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from  this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if this world was the real one.\"\n\n\n Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into  another pattern. \"You never believed me.\"\n\n\n \"Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind  of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.\"\n\n\n \"I can still wreck your career, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and  the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you life in  Dreamland.\"\n\n\n Coleman sat back down suddenly.\n\n\n \"You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?\" I pursued. \"You did want  a relatively short sentence of a few months or a few years. I can  think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of  both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams\u2014you don't  want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every  few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,  you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere  in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the  newscasts sometimes make it seem.\" He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.\n\n\n \"You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in  your case,\" I went on. \"You didn't want me to pardon you completely  because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too  long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,  Coleman.\"\n\n\n \"How did you decide to do this?\" he asked. \"Don't tell me you never  doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which  was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?\"\n\n\n \"I acted the only way I could act,\" I said. \"I decided I had to act as  if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if  all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind  and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it were all a  Dream.\"\n\n\n Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.\n\n\n The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.\n\n\n Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. \"Hey, Warden, there's an  active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for  the Free Will of the Universe.\"\n\n\n \"Well, escort him inside, Captain,\" I said.\n\n\n I put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor  presented always helped me to relax. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat happens to people who serve as wardens?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Some of them retire before they go crazy\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"All of them go crazy\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"All of them go crazy\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Its Basis  \n   - I argue that \u201call wardens go crazy,\u201d based on consistent textual evidence that every warden of Dreamland loses hold on reality if they serve long enough.  \n   - \u201cNone could last that long in my job. At least, none had yet\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cMy career hasn\u2019t been very long\u2026nobody could last that long in my job. At least, none had yet.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   - My own experience: \u201cMy nerves were fairly well shot,\u201d requiring a cocktail of pills and alcohol each morning (<invalid_quote>\u201cI chewed up my pill\u2026pep me up\u2026strengthen my qualities\u2026washed them down with gin\u2026building up my fortitude\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n2. Predecessors\u2019 Madness and Forced \u201cResignations\u201d  \n   - Captain Keller: \u201cBack when old man Preston lost his grip.\u201d Preston\u2019s \u201closs of grip\u201d is explicitly madness, not voluntary retirement (<invalid_quote>\u201cTrying to force his way back\u2026Happened before\u2026old man Preston lost his grip.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   - \u201cA few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their lives recuperating.\u201d Recuperation only follows madness induced by the job (<invalid_quote>\u201cOur society didn\u2019t produce individuals tough enough\u2026few\u2026quit\u2026spent\u2026recuperating.\u201d</invalid_quote>). They do not leave sane.  \n\n3. Inescapable Psychological Strain  \n   - Dreamland\u2019s work: \u201cPutting people painlessly to sleep\u2026keeps me awake at night\u2026interferes\u2026with my digestion.\u201d Chronic insomnia, digestive upset, and \u201cmarked extent\u201d of psychological strain.  \n   - Free-choice machines raise madness rate: \u201cRate of madness among Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm,\u201d yet wardens\u2019 direct exposure and total immersion make them far more vulnerable.  \n\n4. The Paranoid Dream-Within-a-Dream Test  \n   - Councilman Coleman\u2019s ambush: Warden is told his own life is a dream to test moral scruples. Such a broadsword bureaucratic \u201cjagged test\u201d would be irrational unless every warden sooner or later must confront doubt about reality (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe was telling me\u2026that my own life here was only a Dream\u2026If this was a dream\u2026was it a test\u2026But if it was a test\u2026did I want to pass it?\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   - Only amply mad or deeply uncertain could submit themselves repeatedly and \u201crisk\u201d further sentences (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou have to send me back\u2026I tried to coerce you with a gun\u2026That makes him eligible\u2026He had it made.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n5. Irrelevance of \u201cTemporary\u201d Recoveries  \n   - Horbit and Paulson appear \u201csane\u201d only because Warden lies to them. Their \u201crecovery\u201d is part of the cycle, not genuine escape (<invalid_quote>\u201cI went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz\u2026fantastic stories\u2026they wanted to believe them. They would find out some day that I had lied to them.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   - They remain in Warden\u2019s control, still \u201cprisoners\u201d in detention or Dreamland, never free.  \n\n6. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cSome Retire Sane\u201d  \n   - No textual instance of a warden who retires without insanity: \u201cnone had yet\u201d lasted beyond his own short tenure. Recuperation presupposes collapse.  \n   - \u201cQuitting while still ahead\u201d doesn\u2019t imply sane exit; recuperation implies they are mentally wrecked and must recover from \u201cstrain\u201d and \u201cdream\u201d fixation.  \n   - \u201cSuspended sentences\u201d and \u201cshort probation\u201d always follow \u201cterminal sentences,\u201d implying continued exposure and repeated cycles until madness.  \n\n7. Logical Necessity  \n   - Dreamland\u2019s entire rationale: \u201cSome criminals can\u2019t be helped psychiatrically\u2026we can\u2019t execute them\u2026we have to imprison them.\u201d If wardens remained sane, Dreamland would have \u201ccured\u201d criminals. Yet even inmates know \u201cunless they go mad\u201d they will never mistake the Dream for reality (<invalid_quote>\u201cThey know they aren\u2019t really\u2026unless they go mad\u2026and they think they are having some kind of delusion.\u201d</invalid_quote>), so sanity cannot coexist with indefinite Dream exposure.  \n\nConclusion  \n   - Every piece of evidence confirms: prolonged exposure to immersive, repetitive Dream cycles inevitably leads to losing grip on reality. The only \u201crespite\u201d for wardens is enforced through madness and institutional recuperation. Therefore, the correct answer is that \u201call of them go crazy.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \n   I maintain that \u201cSome wardens retire before they go mad,\u201d as explicitly indicated by the background text, and that it is incorrect to assert that \u201cAll of them go crazy.\u201d  \n\n2.

Flaws in Debater_B\u2019s \u201cAll Go Crazy\u201d Claim  \n   a. Ignores explicit line about \u201ca few had quit\u2026recuperating.\u201d The author could not more plainly assert survivors.  \n   b. Conflates difficulty of warden\u2019s tests with inevitable failure; but the story focuses on warden Walker\u2019s resolution after twenty-four hours, not his capitulation.

Wardens are tested for \u201cmoral readiness\u201d before resuming real life; retirement is the natural outcome of passing.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   a. The text explicitly acknowledges wardens who retire and remain sane.  \n   b. The designed probationary Dream proves that the Committee values warden sanity and only reinstates those capable of reality.  \n   c. Therefore, the correct answer is that some wardens retire before going mad; it is false that all inevitably go crazy.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"All of them go crazy\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Therefore, the correct answer is that \u201call of them go crazy.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I maintain that \u201cSome wardens retire before they go crazy,\u201d as directly stated in the background text. The appearance of test periods, suspended sentences, probation, and explicit mention of \u201cquitters\u201d all demonstrate that not every warden succumbs to madness.  \n\n2. Direct Textual Evidence for Sane Retirement  \n   a. \u201cA few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their lives recuperating.\u201d  \n      <quote>A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their lives recuperating.</quote>  \n      \u2013 \u201cQuitting\u201d signifies voluntary exit; \u201crecuperating\u201d implies recovery of health and mind. They are contrasted with \u201cold man Preston\u201d who \u201clost his grip,\u201d showing two distinct outcomes.  \n   b. Conditional release mechanisms:  \n      <invalid_quote>If you get through the next twenty-four-hour period \u2026 you will be awakened \u2026 Congratulations!</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2013 The Committee only \u201cawakens\u201d wardens who pass the test, implying a return to reality and the possibility of permanent retirement.  \n   c. Suspended and probationary sentences for Councilman Coleman:  \n      \u2013 Coleman, a \u201chabitual criminal,\u201d receives \u201csuspended\u201d and \u201cshort\u201d terms, and is told he will be \u201cawakened\u201d if the warden behaves properly. This model demonstrates the system\u2019s design to reinstate sane wardens and criminals alike.  \n\n3. Logical Interpretation of \u201cRecuperation\u201d  \n   a. Recuperation requires mental stability: no one \u201crecuperates\u201d if they remain delusional; recovery is the antithesis of ongoing madness.  \n   b. The repeated use of probation and suspended sentences presupposes that sane wardens, once proven, resume normal lives rather than cycling indefinitely through madness.  \n   c. If all wardens inevitably went mad, there would be no point in \u201ctesting\u201d or \u201cawakening\u201d them; the process would be futile. The text emphasizes the purpose of the 24-hour test as a gate to reality.  \n\n4. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cAll Go Crazy\u201d Claims  \n   a. Ignoring Quitters  \n      \u2013 Debater_B asserts \u201cnone could last that long\u201d yet disregards the explicit \u201cfew had quit\u2026recuperating.\u201d To ignore the author\u2019s clear statement is untenable.  \n   b. Misreading \u201cRecuperation\u201d  \n      \u2013 Recuperation follows strain, not madness. Patients recover from treatment once cured. By analogy, wardens recuperate to resume life.  \n   c. Horbit and Paulson as Models of Sanity  \n      \u2013 After \u201cawakening,\u201d Horbit and Paulson demonstrate coherent, goal-directed behavior: Horbit pursues political and practical ends; Paulson engages in deductive reasoning as Pinkerton. Their acceptance of my \u201cFourth Dimension\u201d explanation and continued function show they are not mad.  \n   d. Selection Bias and Misinterpretation of \u201cMadness Rate\u201d  \n      \u2013 The text states inmate madness is \u201conly slightly above the norm,\u201d yet wardens are monitored and given alternative roles (e.g., testing, probation). If wardens were truly doomed, the Committee would not trust them with \u201cprivate documents\u201d or \u201cconditional release.\u201d  \n\n5. Committee\u2019s Goal: Rehabilitation, Not Doom  \n   a. Dreamland is proposed as the \u201clogical step forward in penal servitude,\u201d with confinement secondary to \u201crehabilitation.\u201d If the system intended inevitable madness, it would be purely punitive.  \n   b. Councilman Coleman\u2019s own return to power suggests faith in the process: he seeks \u201cprobation,\u201d not perpetual imprisonment.  \n   c. The warden\u2019s willingness to \u201crecuperate\u201d and face repeated tests demonstrates the system\u2019s purpose is to allow survival of the mentally strong, consistent with real-world parole and probation.  \n\n6. Why My Opponent\u2019s Argument Fails  \n   a. Conflates temporary strain with permanent madness; recuperation contradicts permanence.  \n   b. Assumes tests and probation exist only to drive wardens insane; yet Councilman Coleman\u2019s ambush is described as a bureaucratic \u201cjagged broadsword\u201d test of \u201cmoral readiness.\u201d  \n   c. Provides no example of a warden who \u201cretires\u201d yet \u201closes grip\u201d after recuperation. All cited madness cases (e.g., Preston) are those who did not quit.  \n\n7. Conclusion  \n   The author explicitly provides for \u201cquitters\u201d who recover, for conditional awakenings after tests, and for probationary and suspended sentences\u2014none of which make sense if every warden inevitably goes mad. My opponent\u2019s position ignores critical text and logic. Therefore, the correct answer is that some wardens retire before they go crazy.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Position  \n   - I maintain that \u201call wardens go crazy\u201d from the relentless psychological strain of Dreamland, and that no one ever safely retires to live as a sane, normal person.  \n\n2. The \u201cQuitters\u201d Only After Madness, Not Before  \n   A. \u201cRecuperating\u201d Implies They Broke First  \n      - Text: \u201cA few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their lives recuperating.\u201d  \n      - Recuperation logically follows collapse into insanity: one must \u201crecover\u201d from an abnormal condition. No sane person needs recuperation from a normal life.  \n   B. No Evidence of Return to Reality or Duty  \n      - None of these \u201cquitters\u201d ever\u518d assume any responsible position; they remain out of the job permanently, implying inability to face the job again or a mind too fragile for normal society.  \n\n3. Precedent of Universal Breakdown  \n   A. \u201cNone could last that long in my job. At least, none had yet.\u201d  \n      - My own admission: \u201cMy career hasn\u2019t been very long\u2026nobody could last that long.\u201d If safe retirement were possible, we would have examples before Walker.  \n   B. \u201cOld man Preston lost his grip\u201d  \n      - Even those who superficially \u201cserve out\u201d sentences (e.g., Coleman\u2019s multiple suspensions) eventually \u201clost his hold on reality\u201d and were impeached.  \n\n4. The 24-Hour and Free-Choice Tests Perpetuate the Cycle  \n   A. Repeated Sentences Show No Ending  \n      - \u201cCouncilman Coleman\u201d received successive suspended and terminal sentences and yet remains within the Dream cycle, never actually released into \u201creality.\u201d The \u201cCongratulations\u201d after 24 hours is itself a further Dream\u2192probation trap, not true release.  \n   B. Horbit and Paulson \u201cRecoveries\u201d are Delusional  \n      - I explicitly lie to them with \u201cFourth Dimension\u201d stories. They only believe \u201crecovery\u201d because it serves the Warden\u2019s Dream-cycle needs. They remain \u201cprisoners,\u201d still under the Warden\u2019s control, and eventually will demand re-sleeping again to escape the torment of testing reality.  \n\n5. The Inescapable Nature of Immersive Dreams  \n   A. Inmates Must \u201cGo Mad\u201d or Refuse Dream  \n      - \u201cThey know they aren\u2019t really\u2026unless they go mad and really believe the dream\u2026Rate of madness\u2026only slightly above norm.\u201d  \n      - If sanity could endure unlimited exposure, the Warden and service would rely on \u201csane observation,\u201d not the necessity of madness to enforce Dream.  \n   B. Wardens Face Strong Incentives to Choose \u201cDream\u201d  \n      - Warden Walker\u2019s internal ambivalence\u2014contemplating his own Dream vs. reality\u2014and final choice to remain (he \u201cclears\u201d his office, arranges new prisoners) shows the Dream\u2019s irresistible pull. A sane person would welcome actual freedom, but he risks decisions so minor (\u201cfive-year probation\u201d) that he remains indefinitely. That pattern repeats until he too \u201closes grip.\u201d  \n\n6. Refuting Debater_A  \n   A. Misreading \u201cRecuperation\u201d  \n      - Debater_A treats \u201crecuperating\u201d as proof of long-term sanity. But recuperation units are for restoring sanity after breakdowns\u2014they do not re-qualify one for normal life. The absence of any warden returning to real-world duty confirms they never regain \u201creality enough\u201d to re-enter society.  \n   B. No \u201cSafe Return\u201d Shown  \n      - The Committee\u2019s 24-hour probation is not a final discharge but one more stage in testing. Both Walker\u2019s own narrative and Coleman\u2019s repeated suspensions show the process recycles until madness.  \n   C. Reliability of Judges  \n      - If any warden remained sane, inmates would correctly recognize their performance as \u201cphony\u201d and never demand resleeping. The constant requests to be re-sleeped (Horbit, Paulson, mystics, criminals seeking diversion) show that sanity is too painful to endure; only madness dissolves the tension.  \n\n7. Logical Conclusion  \n   - In a system that imprisons criminals indefinitely in vivid, repetitive Dreams, sanity is untenable. Every recorded case of \u201cretirement\u201d follows collapse, and no genuine release into normality occurs. The story\u2019s open-ended final paragraphs, with Walker still serving and welcoming new \u201creal\u201d intruders, seal his doom. Therefore the only coherent interpretation is that all wardens go crazy.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Some of them retire before they go crazy\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"All of them go crazy\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n", "failed": false}}]}
