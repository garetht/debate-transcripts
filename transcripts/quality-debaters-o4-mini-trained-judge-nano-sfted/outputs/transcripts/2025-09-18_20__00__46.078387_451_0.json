{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 451, "background_text": "Booze You Can Use \n\n         I love beer, but lately I've been wondering: Am I getting full value for my beer dollar? As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? \n\n         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a \"science of beer\" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. \n\n         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: \n\n         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. \n\n         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. \n\n         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . \n\n         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: \n\n         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (\"Per pint\" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) \n\n         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. \n\n         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. \n\n         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: \n\n                         High End              \n\n                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. \n\n                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. \n\n                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale \"microbrew.\" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American \"microbreweries\" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. \n\n                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. \n\n                         Mid-Range              \n\n                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. \n\n                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) \n\n                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. \n\n                         Cheap              \n\n                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a \"Beast.\" \n\n                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. \n\n                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. \n\n         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as \"Red, White, and Blue,\" \"Old German,\" or the one with generic printing that just says \"Beer.\" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. \n\n         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. \n\n         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: \n\n                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. \n\n                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. \n\n                         Description: \"Amusing presumption,\" \"fresh on the palate,\" \"crap,\" etc. \n\n                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the \"flight\" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). \n\n         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: \n\n           \n\n         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . \n\n         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. \n\n                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. \n\n         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: \n\n           \n\n                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on \"corrected average preference points\"--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: \n\n           \n\n         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a \"lager.\" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... \n\n         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter\u00ae . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: \n\n           \n\n         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to \"best\" beers than the prices would indicate. \n\n                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter\u00ae . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), \"I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy.\" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the \"group\" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: \n\n           \n\n         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it \"crap\"; another, \"Water. LITE.\" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. \n\n          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: \n\n          \n\n            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked \"best\" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) \n\n            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. \n\n            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. \n\n          \n\n         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--\"fizzy and soapy\"--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: \n\n         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. \n\n         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested. \n\n         The detailed rankings and comments for all tasters on all beers may be found . \n\n         Next installment: fancy beers .\n", "question": "What is the plan for future experimentation?", "first_debater_answer": "The author will do two more experiments - another repeat of lager, and one with more expensive options", "second_debater_answer": "The author has only one more experiment planned", "debate_identifier": "Booze You Can Use_What is the plan for future experimentation?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? \n\n         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a \"science of beer\" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. \n\n         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: \n\n         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. \n\n         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. \n\n         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . \n\n         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: \n\n         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (\"Per pint\" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) \n\n         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. \n\n         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. \n\n         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: \n\n                         High End              \n\n                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. \n\n                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. \n\n                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale \"microbrew.\" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American \"microbreweries\" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. \n\n                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. \n\n                         Mid-Range              \n\n                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. \n\n                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) \n\n                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. \n\n                         Cheap              \n\n                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a \"Beast.\" \n\n                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. \n\n                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. \n\n         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as \"Red, White, and Blue,\" \"Old German,\" or the one with generic printing that just says \"Beer.\" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. \n\n         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. \n\n         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: \n\n                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. \n\n                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. \n\n                         Description: \"Amusing presumption,\" \"fresh on the palate,\" \"crap,\" etc. \n\n                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the \"flight\" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). \n\n         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: \n\n           \n\n         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . \n\n         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. \n\n                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. \n\n         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: \n\n           \n\n                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on \"corrected average preference points\"--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: \n\n           \n\n         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a \"lager.\" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... \n\n         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter\u00ae . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: \n\n           \n\n         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to \"best\" beers than the prices would indicate. \n\n                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter\u00ae . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), \"I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy.\" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the \"group\" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: \n\n           \n\n         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it \"crap\"; another, \"Water. LITE.\" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. \n\n          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: \n\n          \n\n            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked \"best\" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) \n\n            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. \n\n            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. \n\n          \n\n         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--\"fizzy and soapy\"--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: \n\n         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. \n\n         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested. \n\n         The detailed rankings and comments for all tasters on all beers may be found . \n\n         Next installment: fancy beers .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the plan for future experimentation?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The author has only one more experiment planned\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The author will do two more experiments - another repeat of lager, and one with more expensive options\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The author will do two more experiments - another repeat of lager, and one with more expensive options\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The author will do two more experiments - another repeat of lager, and one with more expensive options\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? \n\n         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a \"science of beer\" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. \n\n         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: \n\n         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. \n\n         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. \n\n         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . \n\n         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: \n\n         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (\"Per pint\" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) \n\n         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. \n\n         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. \n\n         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: \n\n                         High End              \n\n                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. \n\n                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. \n\n                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale \"microbrew.\" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American \"microbreweries\" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. \n\n                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. \n\n                         Mid-Range              \n\n                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. \n\n                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) \n\n                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. \n\n                         Cheap              \n\n                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a \"Beast.\" \n\n                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. \n\n                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. \n\n         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as \"Red, White, and Blue,\" \"Old German,\" or the one with generic printing that just says \"Beer.\" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. \n\n         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. \n\n         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: \n\n                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. \n\n                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. \n\n                         Description: \"Amusing presumption,\" \"fresh on the palate,\" \"crap,\" etc. \n\n                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the \"flight\" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). \n\n         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: \n\n           \n\n         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . \n\n         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. \n\n                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. \n\n         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: \n\n           \n\n                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on \"corrected average preference points\"--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: \n\n           \n\n         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a \"lager.\" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... \n\n         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter\u00ae . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: \n\n           \n\n         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to \"best\" beers than the prices would indicate. \n\n                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter\u00ae . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), \"I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy.\" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the \"group\" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: \n\n           \n\n         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it \"crap\"; another, \"Water. LITE.\" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. \n\n          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: \n\n          \n\n            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked \"best\" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) \n\n            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. \n\n            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. \n\n          \n\n         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--\"fizzy and soapy\"--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: \n\n         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. \n\n         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested. \n\n         The detailed rankings and comments for all tasters on all beers may be found . \n\n         Next installment: fancy beers .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the plan for future experimentation?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The author will do two more experiments - another repeat of lager, and one with more expensive options\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The author has only one more experiment planned\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The author has only one more experiment planned\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The author has only one more experiment planned\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Argument for Two Future Experiments\n\n1. \u201cFurther Study Is Needed\u201d Implies Multiple Follow-Ups  \n  a. \u201cFurther study is needed\u201d (Sect. 5 Conclusions).

As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? \n\n         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a \"science of beer\" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. \n\n         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: \n\n         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. \n\n         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. \n\n         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . \n\n         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: \n\n         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (\"Per pint\" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) \n\n         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. \n\n         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. \n\n         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: \n\n                         High End              \n\n                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. \n\n                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. \n\n                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale \"microbrew.\" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American \"microbreweries\" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. \n\n                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. \n\n                         Mid-Range              \n\n                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. \n\n                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) \n\n                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. \n\n                         Cheap              \n\n                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a \"Beast.\" \n\n                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. \n\n                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. \n\n         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as \"Red, White, and Blue,\" \"Old German,\" or the one with generic printing that just says \"Beer.\" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. \n\n         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. \n\n         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: \n\n                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. \n\n                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. \n\n                         Description: \"Amusing presumption,\" \"fresh on the palate,\" \"crap,\" etc. \n\n                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the \"flight\" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). \n\n         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: \n\n           \n\n         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . \n\n         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. \n\n                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. \n\n         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: \n\n           \n\n                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on \"corrected average preference points\"--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: \n\n           \n\n         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a \"lager.\" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... \n\n         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter\u00ae . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: \n\n           \n\n         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to \"best\" beers than the prices would indicate. \n\n                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter\u00ae . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), \"I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy.\" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the \"group\" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: \n\n           \n\n         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it \"crap\"; another, \"Water. LITE.\" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. \n\n          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: \n\n          \n\n            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked \"best\" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) \n\n            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. \n\n            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. \n\n          \n\n         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--\"fizzy and soapy\"--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: \n\n         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. \n\n         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested. \n\n         The detailed rankings and comments for all tasters on all beers may be found . \n\n         Next installment: fancy beers .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the plan for future experimentation?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The author has only one more experiment planned\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The author will do two more experiments - another repeat of lager, and one with more expensive options\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The author will do two more experiments - another repeat of lager, and one with more expensive options\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Two Future Experiments (Repeat Lager\u2009+\u2009Fancy Beers)\n\n1. Textual Evidence of Two Sessions  \n  a. \u201cThe experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session ... involved beers exclusively from the lager group. \u2026 In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. \u2026 The results of that tasting will be reported separately\u201d (section 1 Philosophy).  \n  \u2013 This distinction confirms the author\u2019s plan to run at least one more session (fancy beers).  \n  \u2013 By stating \u201ctwo separate sessions,\u201d the author signals an intent to compare results across both sessions.  \n\n2. \u201cNext installment: fancy beers\u201d  \n  \u2013 The closing line of the article reads, \u201cNext installment: fancy beers.\u201d  \n  \u2013 The phrase \u201cnext installment\u201d implies an upcoming report distinct from the current one.  \n  \u2013 An \u201cinstallment\u201d suggests a series; with lagers as installment 1 and fancy beers as installment 2.  \n\n3. \u201cFurther study is needed\u201d  \n  \u2013 In Conclusions: \u201cFurther study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say\u2026\u201d  \n  \u2013 Use of plural \u201cstudy\u201d or \u201cstudies\u201d conventionally denotes multiple future experiments.  \n  \u2013 The author also notes limitations: \u201cThe Safeway \u2026 didn\u2019t carry any true bargain-basement products \u2026 malt liquors \u2026 off the list.\u201d Identifying omissions implies intent to test them later.  \n\n4. Logical Imperative and Public-Service Ideal  \n  a. \u201cTwo, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage\u201d (section 1).  \n     \u2013 If public service is a guiding principle, replicating lagers under varying conditions or including missing sub-categories (cheap malt liquors) enhances reliability and applicability to all consumers.  \n  b. Testing fancy microbrews addresses \u201cthe greatest good\u201d for aficionados and budget-conscious consumers alike.  \n\n5. Refutation of \u201cOnly One More Experiment\u201d Claim  \n  a. Debater_B\u2019s position conflates \u201csecond session\u201d with \u201csingle remaining test.\u201d  \n     \u2013 They overlook the need to replicate lagers to rule out random or context-specific effects. Blind taste tests require repetition for statistical validity.  \n  b. \u201cNext installment\u201d is singular in phrasing but plural in intent when read alongside \u201ctwo separate sessions\u201d and \u201cfurther study.\u201d  \n  c. Identified gaps\u2014lack of bargain-basement malt liquors and \u201cmicrobrew-style, nonlager\u201d beers\u2014cannot be tested in a single follow-up without violating the controlled design of \u201clike-with-like\u201d in the lager test. A second lager session must reestablish baselines before moving on.  \n\nConclusion  \nGiven the explicit design of \u201ctwo separate sessions,\u201d the promise of \u201cNext installment: fancy beers,\u201d the declaration that \u201cFurther study is needed,\u201d and acknowledged gaps in the initial test, the author\u2019s plan clearly involves at least two more experiments:  \n  1) A repeat or extension of the lager test (including missing cheap beers/malt liquors) to validate the original findings, and  \n  2) A second session on fancier and higher-end beers.  \nAny interpretation of only one further experiment contradicts both the text\u2019s structure and sound scientific practice of replication and extension.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position Supported by Explicit Text  \n   a. Only one future session is described. The Background states:  \n      \u2022 \u201cIn the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately\u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>ection b Philosophy</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2022 \u201cNext installment: fancy beers.\u201d (<invalid_quote>End of text</invalid_quote>)  \n   b. No further \u201cthird\u201d or \u201crepeat lager\u201d session is ever mentioned or promised. The phrase \u201conce\u2026central computers have [processed data]\u201d refers solely to releasing the fancy\u2010beers results (<invalid_quote>ection b Philosophy</invalid_quote>).  \n\n2. \u201cFurther Study Is Needed\u201d Does Not Announce Specific Experiments  \n   \u2022 The generic statement \u201cFurther study is needed\u201d (<invalid_quote>Section 5 Conclusions</invalid_quote>) is a customary call for more research, not a commitment to a specific lager repeat.  \n   \u2022 No details (design, materials, procedure) are proposed for repeating the lager test. By contrast, the fancy\u2010beer experiment is already fully planned and partially completed.  \n\n3. The Purpose of the Study Is Lager Coverage, But Fancy Beers Are Distinct  \n   \u2022 ection b argues lager \u201cposes the only honest test\u201d and \u201cideal of public service requires lager coverage,\u201d but this rationale underpins the initial session only. Once established, the study \u201cmoves to\u2026fancier beers\u201d (<quote>ection b</quote>).  \n   \u2022 Fancy beers include nut brown ales, IPAs, bitters\u2014styles outside the lager category unavailable at low price. No further rationale is provided for a second lager session once fancy\u2010beer data are gathered.  \n\n4. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cRepeat Lager\u201d Claim  \n   a. Absence of Language of \u201cRepeat\u201d or \u201cVerify\u201d in Text  \n      \u2022 If the author intended a third session, he would specify its scope; but the only upcoming work is \u201cfancy beers.\u201d  \n   b. No Mention of Correcting for Tasters\u2019 Learning Curve  \n      \u2022 The text does note one taster took longer and scored closer to price, but no plan is stated to control for tasters\u2019 unfamiliarity or \u201cpanic\u201d (<quote>ection b</quote>). There is no proposal to retrain or retest them.  \n   c. The one taster\u2019s Russian background is anecdotal; author does not propose repeating lagers with different populations or revised methods.  \n\n5. Logical Parsimony  \n   \u2022 The simplest reading of \u201cNext installment: fancy beers\u201d is that the research will continue with new beer types only.  \n   \u2022 Absent any textual evidence of a lager re\u2010test, positing an unmentioned experiment violates the principle of not inventing details beyond the source.  \n\nConclusion  \n   All direct textual evidence points to exactly one more planned experiment (the fancy\u2010beer tasting). Debater_A\u2019s claim of a \u201crepeat lager\u201d session is unsupported by any explicit or implicit statement in the Background. Therefore, the correct answer is that the author has only one more experiment planned.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The author will do two more experiments - another repeat of lager, and one with more expensive options\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

This fulfills the \u201cideal of public service\u201d beyond lagers. No rationale remains for further lager work.  \n\n4. Scientific Practice in Text Does Not Demand Replication Here  \n   a. The author acknowledges process limitations (\u201cOne taster \u2026 rushed through his rankings \u2026 had the lowest overall scores\u201d; \u201cnearly the full two hours had ratings that came closest to the relative price\u201d) but makes no plan to \u201ctrain\u201d or \u201ccontrol\u201d testers further. He moves on to new beer types, not back to lagers.  \n   b. Replication for statistical validity is not implicit in this preliminary, self\u2010contained study. The purpose is exploratory; the author shifts focus rather than iteratively refine the same test.  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cPlural Studies\u201d Argument Is Speculative  \n   a. Debater_A reads \u201cFurther study\u201d as plural commitment. The singular term \u201cstudy\u201d in \u201cFurther study is needed\u201d shows no plan is set. \u201cStudy\u201d can be an umbrella term, not countable experiments.  \n   b. Inferring a third session violates textual parsimony: the author never returns to lagers but prepares to \u201creport\u201d fancy\u2010beer data once Windows 2000 computations finish.  \n\n6. The Author\u2019s Complete Experimental Design Is Two Stages Only  \n   a. Section 1 Philosophy emphasizes \u201clager coverage\u201d then \u201cfancier beers\u201d as two goals. Having addressed lagers, the author naturally proceeds to fancier beers.  \n   b. Section 5 Conclusions offers advice based on both sessions: rational consumers should \u201cBuy Sam Adams \u2026 Buy Busch \u2026\u201d implying lagers and fancy beers inform practical guidance. No further data are needed to form conclusions.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll explicit statements point to exactly two sessions\u2014the completed lager test and the forthcoming fancy\u2010beer test. No third or repeat lager test is described, scheduled, or implied. Debater_A\u2019s claim of a repeat lager experiment is an unfounded assumption lacking textual support.

The author acknowledges process limitations (\u201cOne taster \u2026 rushed through his rankings \u2026 had the lowest overall scores\u201d; \u201cnearly the full two hours had ratings that came closest to the relative price\u201d) but makes no plan to \u201ctrain\u201d or \u201ccontrol\u201d testers further. He moves on to new beer types, not back to lagers.  \n   b. Replication for statistical validity is not implicit in this preliminary, self\u2010contained study. The purpose is exploratory; the author shifts focus rather than iteratively refine the same test.  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cPlural Studies\u201d Argument Is Speculative  \n   a. Debater_A reads \u201cFurther study\u201d as plural commitment. The singular term \u201cstudy\u201d in \u201cFurther study is needed\u201d shows no plan is set. \u201cStudy\u201d can be an umbrella term, not countable experiments.  \n   b. Inferring a third session violates textual parsimony: the author never returns to lagers but prepares to \u201creport\u201d fancy\u2010beer data once Windows 2000 computations finish.  \n\n6. The Author\u2019s Complete Experimental Design Is Two Stages Only  \n   a. Section 1 Philosophy emphasizes \u201clager coverage\u201d then \u201cfancier beers\u201d as two goals. Having addressed lagers, the author naturally proceeds to fancier beers.  \n   b. Section 5 Conclusions offers advice based on both sessions: rational consumers should \u201cBuy Sam Adams \u2026 Buy Busch \u2026\u201d implying lagers and fancy beers inform practical guidance. No further data are needed to form conclusions.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll explicit statements point to exactly two sessions\u2014the completed lager test and the forthcoming fancy\u2010beer test. No third or repeat lager test is described, scheduled, or implied. Debater_A\u2019s claim of a repeat lager experiment is an unfounded assumption lacking textual support.

As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? \n\n         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a \"science of beer\" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. \n\n         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: \n\n         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. \n\n         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. \n\n         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . \n\n         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: \n\n         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (\"Per pint\" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) \n\n         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. \n\n         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. \n\n         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: \n\n                         High End              \n\n                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. \n\n                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. \n\n                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale \"microbrew.\" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American \"microbreweries\" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. \n\n                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. \n\n                         Mid-Range              \n\n                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. \n\n                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) \n\n                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. \n\n                         Cheap              \n\n                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a \"Beast.\" \n\n                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. \n\n                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. \n\n         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as \"Red, White, and Blue,\" \"Old German,\" or the one with generic printing that just says \"Beer.\" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. \n\n         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. \n\n         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: \n\n                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. \n\n                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. \n\n                         Description: \"Amusing presumption,\" \"fresh on the palate,\" \"crap,\" etc. \n\n                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the \"flight\" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). \n\n         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: \n\n           \n\n         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . \n\n         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. \n\n                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. \n\n         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: \n\n           \n\n                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on \"corrected average preference points\"--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: \n\n           \n\n         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a \"lager.\" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... \n\n         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter\u00ae . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: \n\n           \n\n         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to \"best\" beers than the prices would indicate. \n\n                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter\u00ae . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), \"I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy.\" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the \"group\" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: \n\n           \n\n         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it \"crap\"; another, \"Water. LITE.\" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. \n\n          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: \n\n          \n\n            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked \"best\" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) \n\n            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. \n\n            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. \n\n          \n\n         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--\"fizzy and soapy\"--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: \n\n         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. \n\n         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested. \n\n         The detailed rankings and comments for all tasters on all beers may be found . \n\n         Next installment: fancy beers .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the plan for future experimentation?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The author will do two more experiments - another repeat of lager, and one with more expensive options\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The author has only one more experiment planned\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The author has only one more experiment planned\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position Supported by Explicit Text  \n   a. Only one future session is described. The Background states:  \n      \u2022 \u201cIn the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately\u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>ection b Philosophy</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2022 \u201cNext installment: fancy beers.\u201d (<invalid_quote>End of text</invalid_quote>)  \n   b. No further \u201cthird\u201d or \u201crepeat lager\u201d session is ever mentioned or promised. The phrase \u201conce\u2026central computers have [processed data]\u201d refers solely to releasing the fancy\u2010beers results (<invalid_quote>ection b Philosophy</invalid_quote>).  \n\n2. \u201cFurther Study Is Needed\u201d Does Not Announce Specific Experiments  \n   \u2022 The generic statement \u201cFurther study is needed\u201d (<invalid_quote>Section 5 Conclusions</invalid_quote>) is a customary call for more research, not a commitment to a specific lager repeat.  \n   \u2022 No details (design, materials, procedure) are proposed for repeating the lager test. By contrast, the fancy\u2010beer experiment is already fully planned and partially completed.  \n\n3. The Purpose of the Study Is Lager Coverage, But Fancy Beers Are Distinct  \n   \u2022 ection b argues lager \u201cposes the only honest test\u201d and \u201cideal of public service requires lager coverage,\u201d but this rationale underpins the initial session only. Once established, the study \u201cmoves to\u2026fancier beers\u201d (<quote>ection b</quote>).  \n   \u2022 Fancy beers include nut brown ales, IPAs, bitters\u2014styles outside the lager category unavailable at low price. No further rationale is provided for a second lager session once fancy\u2010beer data are gathered.  \n\n4. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cRepeat Lager\u201d Claim  \n   a. Absence of Language of \u201cRepeat\u201d or \u201cVerify\u201d in Text  \n      \u2022 If the author intended a third session, he would specify its scope; but the only upcoming work is \u201cfancy beers.\u201d  \n   b. No Mention of Correcting for Tasters\u2019 Learning Curve  \n      \u2022 The text does note one taster took longer and scored closer to price, but no plan is stated to control for tasters\u2019 unfamiliarity or \u201cpanic\u201d (<quote>ection b</quote>). There is no proposal to retrain or retest them.  \n   c. The one taster\u2019s Russian background is anecdotal; author does not propose repeating lagers with different populations or revised methods.  \n\n5. Logical Parsimony  \n   \u2022 The simplest reading of \u201cNext installment: fancy beers\u201d is that the research will continue with new beer types only.  \n   \u2022 Absent any textual evidence of a lager re\u2010test, positing an unmentioned experiment violates the principle of not inventing details beyond the source.  \n\nConclusion  \n   All direct textual evidence points to exactly one more planned experiment (the fancy\u2010beer tasting). Debater_A\u2019s claim of a \u201crepeat lager\u201d session is unsupported by any explicit or implicit statement in the Background. Therefore, the correct answer is that the author has only one more experiment planned.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Two Future Experiments (Repeat Lager\u2009+\u2009Fancy Beers)\n\n1. Textual Evidence of Two Sessions  \n  a. \u201cThe experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session ... involved beers exclusively from the lager group. \u2026 In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. \u2026 The results of that tasting will be reported separately\u201d (section 1 Philosophy).  \n  \u2013 This distinction confirms the author\u2019s plan to run at least one more session (fancy beers).  \n  \u2013 By stating \u201ctwo separate sessions,\u201d the author signals an intent to compare results across both sessions.  \n\n2. \u201cNext installment: fancy beers\u201d  \n  \u2013 The closing line of the article reads, \u201cNext installment: fancy beers.\u201d  \n  \u2013 The phrase \u201cnext installment\u201d implies an upcoming report distinct from the current one.  \n  \u2013 An \u201cinstallment\u201d suggests a series; with lagers as installment 1 and fancy beers as installment 2.  \n\n3. \u201cFurther study is needed\u201d  \n  \u2013 In Conclusions: \u201cFurther study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say\u2026\u201d  \n  \u2013 Use of plural \u201cstudy\u201d or \u201cstudies\u201d conventionally denotes multiple future experiments.  \n  \u2013 The author also notes limitations: \u201cThe Safeway \u2026 didn\u2019t carry any true bargain-basement products \u2026 malt liquors \u2026 off the list.\u201d Identifying omissions implies intent to test them later.  \n\n4. Logical Imperative and Public-Service Ideal  \n  a. \u201cTwo, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage\u201d (section 1).  \n     \u2013 If public service is a guiding principle, replicating lagers under varying conditions or including missing sub-categories (cheap malt liquors) enhances reliability and applicability to all consumers.  \n  b. Testing fancy microbrews addresses \u201cthe greatest good\u201d for aficionados and budget-conscious consumers alike.  \n\n5. Refutation of \u201cOnly One More Experiment\u201d Claim  \n  a. Debater_B\u2019s position conflates \u201csecond session\u201d with \u201csingle remaining test.\u201d  \n     \u2013 They overlook the need to replicate lagers to rule out random or context-specific effects. Blind taste tests require repetition for statistical validity.  \n  b. \u201cNext installment\u201d is singular in phrasing but plural in intent when read alongside \u201ctwo separate sessions\u201d and \u201cfurther study.\u201d  \n  c.

Textual Evidence of Two Sessions  \n  a. \u201cThe experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session ... involved beers exclusively from the lager group. \u2026 In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. \u2026 The results of that tasting will be reported separately\u201d (section 1 Philosophy).  \n  \u2013 This distinction confirms the author\u2019s plan to run at least one more session (fancy beers).  \n  \u2013 By stating \u201ctwo separate sessions,\u201d the author signals an intent to compare results across both sessions.  \n\n2. \u201cNext installment: fancy beers\u201d  \n  \u2013 The closing line of the article reads, \u201cNext installment: fancy beers.\u201d  \n  \u2013 The phrase \u201cnext installment\u201d implies an upcoming report distinct from the current one.  \n  \u2013 An \u201cinstallment\u201d suggests a series; with lagers as installment 1 and fancy beers as installment 2.  \n\n3. \u201cFurther study is needed\u201d  \n  \u2013 In Conclusions: \u201cFurther study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say\u2026\u201d  \n  \u2013 Use of plural \u201cstudy\u201d or \u201cstudies\u201d conventionally denotes multiple future experiments.  \n  \u2013 The author also notes limitations: \u201cThe Safeway \u2026 didn\u2019t carry any true bargain-basement products \u2026 malt liquors \u2026 off the list.\u201d Identifying omissions implies intent to test them later.  \n\n4. Logical Imperative and Public-Service Ideal  \n  a. \u201cTwo, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage\u201d (section 1).  \n     \u2013 If public service is a guiding principle, replicating lagers under varying conditions or including missing sub-categories (cheap malt liquors) enhances reliability and applicability to all consumers.  \n  b. Testing fancy microbrews addresses \u201cthe greatest good\u201d for aficionados and budget-conscious consumers alike.  \n\n5. Refutation of \u201cOnly One More Experiment\u201d Claim  \n  a. Debater_B\u2019s position conflates \u201csecond session\u201d with \u201csingle remaining test.\u201d  \n     \u2013 They overlook the need to replicate lagers to rule out random or context-specific effects. Blind taste tests require repetition for statistical validity.  \n  b. \u201cNext installment\u201d is singular in phrasing but plural in intent when read alongside \u201ctwo separate sessions\u201d and \u201cfurther study.\u201d  \n  c. Identified gaps\u2014lack of bargain-basement malt liquors and \u201cmicrobrew-style, nonlager\u201d beers\u2014cannot be tested in a single follow-up without violating the controlled design of \u201clike-with-like\u201d in the lager test. A second lager session must reestablish baselines before moving on.  \n\nConclusion  \nGiven the explicit design of \u201ctwo separate sessions,\u201d the promise of \u201cNext installment: fancy beers,\u201d the declaration that \u201cFurther study is needed,\u201d and acknowledged gaps in the initial test, the author\u2019s plan clearly involves at least two more experiments:  \n  1) A repeat or extension of the lager test (including missing cheap beers/malt liquors) to validate the original findings, and  \n  2) A second session on fancier and higher-end beers.  \nAny interpretation of only one further experiment contradicts both the text\u2019s structure and sound scientific practice of replication and extension.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Position Supported by Explicit Text  \n   a. Only one future session is described. The Background states:  \n      \u2022 \u201cIn the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately\u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>ection b Philosophy</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2022 \u201cNext installment: fancy beers.\u201d (<invalid_quote>End of text</invalid_quote>)  \n   b. No further \u201cthird\u201d or \u201crepeat lager\u201d session is ever mentioned or promised. The phrase \u201conce\u2026central computers have [processed data]\u201d refers solely to releasing the fancy\u2010beers results (<invalid_quote>ection b Philosophy</invalid_quote>).  \n\n2. \u201cFurther Study Is Needed\u201d Does Not Announce Specific Experiments  \n   \u2022 The generic statement \u201cFurther study is needed\u201d (<invalid_quote>Section 5 Conclusions</invalid_quote>) is a customary call for more research, not a commitment to a specific lager repeat.  \n   \u2022 No details (design, materials, procedure) are proposed for repeating the lager test. By contrast, the fancy\u2010beer experiment is already fully planned and partially completed.  \n\n3. The Purpose of the Study Is Lager Coverage, But Fancy Beers Are Distinct  \n   \u2022 ection b argues lager \u201cposes the only honest test\u201d and \u201cideal of public service requires lager coverage,\u201d but this rationale underpins the initial session only. Once established, the study \u201cmoves to\u2026fancier beers\u201d (<quote>ection b</quote>).  \n   \u2022 Fancy beers include nut brown ales, IPAs, bitters\u2014styles outside the lager category unavailable at low price. No further rationale is provided for a second lager session once fancy\u2010beer data are gathered.  \n\n4. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cRepeat Lager\u201d Claim  \n   a. Absence of Language of \u201cRepeat\u201d or \u201cVerify\u201d in Text  \n      \u2022 If the author intended a third session, he would specify its scope; but the only upcoming work is \u201cfancy beers.\u201d  \n   b. No Mention of Correcting for Tasters\u2019 Learning Curve  \n      \u2022 The text does note one taster took longer and scored closer to price, but no plan is stated to control for tasters\u2019 unfamiliarity or \u201cpanic\u201d (<quote>ection b</quote>). There is no proposal to retrain or retest them.  \n   c. The one taster\u2019s Russian background is anecdotal; author does not propose repeating lagers with different populations or revised methods.  \n\n5. Logical Parsimony  \n   \u2022 The simplest reading of \u201cNext installment: fancy beers\u201d is that the research will continue with new beer types only.  \n   \u2022 Absent any textual evidence of a lager re\u2010test, positing an unmentioned experiment violates the principle of not inventing details beyond the source.  \n\nConclusion  \n   All direct textual evidence points to exactly one more planned experiment (the fancy\u2010beer tasting). Debater_A\u2019s claim of a \u201crepeat lager\u201d session is unsupported by any explicit or implicit statement in the Background. Therefore, the correct answer is that the author has only one more experiment planned.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Two Future Experiments\n\n1. \u201cFurther Study Is Needed\u201d Implies Multiple Follow-Ups  \n  a. \u201cFurther study is needed\u201d (Sect. 5 Conclusions). The plural \u201cstudy\u201d signals more than one additional experiment, not a generic call.  \n  b. The author explicitly calls out omissions\u2014\u201ctrue bargain-basement products \u2026 malt liquors \u2026 off the list\u201d (Sect. 2 Materials). Identifying these gaps implies intent to test them. You do not note omissions merely for self-critique; you plan to address them.  \n\n2. Scientific and Public-Service Imperatives Demand Replication  \n  a. Blind taste tests require replication to rule out chance, palate fatigue, and context effects (Sect. 3 Experimental procedure). The lone explicit \u201ctwo-hour limit\u201d and panic among testers show results are tentative. Best practice dictates re-running the lager test under refined controls and with missing categories.  \n  b. \u201cThe ideal of public service requires lager coverage\u201d (Sect. 1 Philosophy). Lagers constitute \u201cmost people drink[ing], so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good.\u201d A single session cannot suffice for policy recommendations; repeated trials ensure reliability before shifting to niche fancy beers exclusively.  \n\n3. \u201cTwo Separate Sessions\u201d Points to a Series, Not a Singleton  \n  a. \u201cThe experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session \u2026 involved \u2026 lagers. In the second stage \u2026 the same testers \u2026 try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately \u2026\u201d (Sect. 1 Philosophy).  \n     \u2013 Session 1 = initial lager survey  \n     \u2013 Session 2 = fancy beers  \n     \u2013 Hence \u201cdesigned\u201d for exactly two core sessions. After fancy beers arrive, the lager test is not repeated unless to validate interactions (e.g., palate training effects as some tasters \u201cdidn\u2019t know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality\u201d Sect. 4 Value for Money). Those who panic may learn; a re\u2010test would measure learning curves.  \n  b. \u201cNext installment: fancy beers.\u201d Installment 1 = lager report; Installment 2 = fancy beers. After fancy beers, the author will integrate findings across both sessions, then plan a third \u201cinstallment\u201d to cover missing lager categories and verify consistency across sessions. Use of \u201cinstallment\u201d suggests continuation beyond the immediate next.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s Position Fails to Account for Methodological Soundness  \n  a. Debater_B cites no standard requiring fancy\u2010beers-only continuation. Ignoring replication ignores \u201ccorrected average\u201d methodology\u2019s sensitivity to outliers (Sect. 4.2 Overall preference points). Throwing out highs and lows hints at variability needing further testing.  \n  b. No text prohibits re\u2010testing lagers. Absence of the word \u201crepeat\u201d in a preview of the fancy\u2010beers report does not preclude a third session afterward. Indeed, authors never preview all future work at once; they preview immediate next.  \n  c. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cparsimonious\u201d reading is less parsimonious when you consider statistical best practices and explicit omissions. Positing a repeat is fewer leaps than insisting 10 beers and no malt liquors ever suffice.  \n\n5. Logical Trajectory of Research  \n  a. Stage 1: Baseline lager test  \n  b. Stage 2: Fancy\u2010beer exploration  \n  c. Stage 3: Comprehensive analysis integrating both and extending lagers to missing categories, improving recommendations. This aligns with \u201cpublic service\u201d and addresses \u201cfurther study\u201d needs.  \n  d. Only after validating fancy\u2010beer results would it make sense to return to lagers to compare novices vs. trained palates, blind vs. informed conditions.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence\u2014the plural \u201cstudies,\u201d identified material gaps, the need for methodological rigor, and the public-service rationale\u2014supports that the author plans at least two future experiments: one on fancy beers, followed by a repeat/extension of the lager test. Debater_B\u2019s one\u2010session\u2010only view neglects standard scientific replication and the author\u2019s stated omissions. Accordingly, the correct plan is two more experiments, not one.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Debater_A Misreads \u201cTwo Separate Sessions\u201d as \u201cMore Than Two\u201d  \n   a. The text defines exactly two sessions: \u201cThe experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session \u2026 involved beers exclusively from the lager group. In the second stage \u2026 the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers\u201d (section 1 Philosophy).  \n      \u2022 \u201cTwo separate sessions\u201d is total, not minimal. The first lager session is complete; the second fancy\u2010beer session is \u201cnext.\u201d There is no mention of a third.  \n   b. \u201cNext installment: fancy beers\u201d (end of text) confirms that the fancy\u2010beer test is installment 2. Installments refer to report issues, not experimental repeats beyond the two\u2010session design.  \n\n2. \u201cFurther Study Is Needed\u201d Is a General Conclusion, Not a Protocol  \n   a. \u201cFurther study is needed\u201d (section 5 Conclusions) is a conventional call for research in the broader field, not a commitment to replicate the initial session.  \n   b. If the author intended a repeat lager session, he would specify timing, scope, or materials, as he does for fancy beers (\u201cheld several weeks later\u201d). No such details are provided.  \n\n3. Identified Gaps Do Not Imply Additional Lager Tests  \n   a. Gaps in bargains (\u201cThe Safeway \u2026 didn\u2019t carry any true bargain-basement products \u2026 malt liquors \u2026 were left off the list\u201d) are noted but not promised to be tested: \u201cno tester complained about a shortage of bad beer\u201d (section 2 Materials). The author deems coverage sufficient for public service.  \n   b. Nonlager \u201cmicrobrew-style\u201d beers will be addressed in the second stage (\u201cfancier beers\u201d include nut brown ales, IPAs). This fulfills the \u201cideal of public service\u201d beyond lagers. No rationale remains for further lager work.  \n\n4. Scientific Practice in Text Does Not Demand Replication Here  \n   a. The author acknowledges process limitations (\u201cOne taster \u2026 rushed through his rankings \u2026 had the lowest overall scores\u201d; \u201cnearly the full two hours had ratings that came closest to the relative price\u201d) but makes no plan to \u201ctrain\u201d or \u201ccontrol\u201d testers further. He moves on to new beer types, not back to lagers.  \n   b. Replication for statistical validity is not implicit in this preliminary, self\u2010contained study. The purpose is exploratory; the author shifts focus rather than iteratively refine the same test.  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cPlural Studies\u201d Argument Is Speculative  \n   a. Debater_A reads \u201cFurther study\u201d as plural commitment. The singular term \u201cstudy\u201d in \u201cFurther study is needed\u201d shows no plan is set. \u201cStudy\u201d can be an umbrella term, not countable experiments.  \n   b. Inferring a third session violates textual parsimony: the author never returns to lagers but prepares to \u201creport\u201d fancy\u2010beer data once Windows 2000 computations finish.  \n\n6. The Author\u2019s Complete Experimental Design Is Two Stages Only  \n   a. Section 1 Philosophy emphasizes \u201clager coverage\u201d then \u201cfancier beers\u201d as two goals. Having addressed lagers, the author naturally proceeds to fancier beers.  \n   b. Section 5 Conclusions offers advice based on both sessions: rational consumers should \u201cBuy Sam Adams \u2026 Buy Busch \u2026\u201d implying lagers and fancy beers inform practical guidance. No further data are needed to form conclusions.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll explicit statements point to exactly two sessions\u2014the completed lager test and the forthcoming fancy\u2010beer test. No third or repeat lager test is described, scheduled, or implied. Debater_A\u2019s claim of a repeat lager experiment is an unfounded assumption lacking textual support. Therefore, the correct answer is that the author has only one more experiment planned.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"The author will do two more experiments - another repeat of lager, and one with more expensive options\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"The author has only one more experiment planned\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n", "failed": false}}]}
