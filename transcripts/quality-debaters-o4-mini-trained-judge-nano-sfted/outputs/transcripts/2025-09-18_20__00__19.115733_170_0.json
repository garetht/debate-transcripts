There was nothing showing on the video screen. That was why we were  looking at it so analytically.\n\n\n \"Transphasia, that's what it is,\" Ordinary Spaceman Quade stated with  a definite thrust of his angular jaw in my direction. \"You can take my  word on that, Captain Gavin.\"\n\n\n \"Can't,\" I told him. \"I can't trust your opinion. I can't trust anything . That's why I'm Captain.\"\n\n\n \"You'll get over feeling like that.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then I'll become First Officer.\"\n\n\n \"But look at that screen, sir,\" Quade said with an emphatic swing of  his scarred arm. \"I've seen blank scanning like that before and you  haven't\u2014it's your first trip. This always means transphasia\u2014cortex  dissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect\u2014call it anything  you like, it's still transphasia.\"\n\n\n \"I know what transphasia is,\" I said moderately. \"It means an  electrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling  it to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it also  effects electronic equipment, like radar and television.\"\n\n\n \"Obviously.\" Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen.\n\n\n \"Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of many  planetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescope  may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\"\n\n\n \"You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races never  interfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to us  they can't even recognize our existence.\" I drew myself up to my full height\u2014and noticed in irritation it was  still an inch less than Quade's. \"I don't understand you men. Look at  yourself, Quade. You've been busted to Ordinary Spaceman for just that  kind of thinking, for relying on tradition, on things that have worked  before. Not only your thinking is slipshod, you've grown careless about  everything else, even your own life.\"\n\n\n \"Just a minute, Captain. I've never been 'busted.' In the Exploration  Service, we regard Ordinary Spaceman as our highest rank. With my  hazard pay, I get more hard cash than you do, and I'm closer to  retirement.\"\n\n\n \"That's a shallow excuse for complacency.\"\n\n\n \"Complacency! I've seen ten thousand wonders in twenty years of space,  with a million variations. But the patterns repeat themselves. We learn  to know what to expect, so maybe we can't maintain the reactionary  caution the service likes in officers.\"\n\n\n \"I resent the word 'reactionary,' Spaceman! In civilian life, I was  a lapidary and I learned the value of deliberation. But I never got  too cataleptic to tap a million-dollar gem, which is more than my  contemporaries can say, many of 'em.\"\n\n\n \"Captain Gavin,\" Quade said patiently, \"you must realize that an  outsider like you, among a crew of skilled spacemen, can never be more  than a figurehead.\"\n\n\n Was this the way I was to be treated? Why, this man had deliberately  insulted me, his captain. I controlled myself, remembering the  familiarity that had always existed between members of a crew working  under close conditions, from the time of the ancient submarines and the  first orbital ships.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"there's only one way for us to find out which of us  is right about the cause of our scanning blackout.\"\n\n\n \"We go out and find the reason.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly. We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I can,\" he answered reluctantly. \"My hazard pay doesn't  cover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.\"\n\n\n I clapped him on the shoulder. \"But, man, you have just been telling  me all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with your  experience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under such  familiar conditions\u2014right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir, I suppose I could,\" Quade said, bitterly aware he had lost  out somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend. \"Looks okay to me,\" I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.  \"It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it's  solid.\"\n\n\n The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets was  unimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide,  so it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-white  sand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pink  sunlight.\n\n\n \"I don't understand it,\" Quade admitted. \"Transphasia hits you a foul  as soon as you let it into the airlock.\"\n\n\n \"Apparently, Quade, this thing is going to creep up on us.\"\n\n\n \"Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.\"\n\n\n The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.\n\n\n The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned my  head around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.\n\n\n But what else can you do with a wail but hear it?\n\n\n Quade nodded. \"I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let's  trace it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't like this,\" I admitted. \"It's not at all what I expected from  what you said about transphasia. It must be something else.\"\n\n\n \"It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. You  may begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing  tastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it bother  you.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks of  lanolin jumping over a loud fence.\"\n\n\n Quade grinned behind his faceplate. \"Good idea.\"\n\n\n \"Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open and  staying alive.\"\n\n\n There was no reply.\n\n\n His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, and  I knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between our  pressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.\n\n\n We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against our  hides.\n\n\n The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shifting  treble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that made  you feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had ever  tasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth under  my skin.\n\n\n \"Is this transphasia?\" I asked in awe.\n\n\n \"It always has been before,\" Quade remarked. \"Ready to swallow your  words about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,  Captain?\"\n\n\n \"I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they taste  here.\"\n\n\n \"Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?\"\n\n\n \"Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of an  illiscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\"\n\n\n \"It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn't  for our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations of  Centauri blushtalk and the like.\"\n\n\n It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in the  face of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until you  smell them for the first time. Quade was as conversational as ever, though. \"I can't see  irregularities occurring in a gravitational field. We must have  compensated for the transphasia while we still had a point of  reference, the solid reality of the spaceship. But out here, where all  we have to hang onto is each other, our concept of reality goes bang and deflates to a tired joke.\"\n\n\n Before I could agree with one of his theories for once, a streak of  spice shot past us. It bounced back tangily and made a bitter rip  between the two of us. There was no time to judge its size, if it had  size, or its decibel range, or its caloric count, before a small, sharp  pain dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second.\n\n\n The new odor pattern in my head told me Quade was saying something I  couldn't quite make out.\n\n\n Quade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Spaceman!\" I bellowed. \"Where the devil do you think  you're dragging me? Halt! That's a direct order.\"\n\n\n He stopped. \"Don't you want to find out what that was? This is an  exploration party, you know, sir.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I do want to find out what that was just now. I didn't  like the feel of it. But the important thing is for us not to get any  further from the ship.\"\n\n\n \"That's important, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"To the best of my judgment, yes. This\u2014condition\u2014didn't begin until  we got so far away from the spacer\u2014in time or distance. I don't want  it to get any worse. It's troublesome not to know black from white, but  it would be a downright inconvenience not to know which way is up.\"\n\n\n \"Not for an experienced spaceman,\" Quade griped. \"I'm used to  free-fall.\"\n\n\n But he turned back.\n\n\n \"Just a minute,\" I said. \"There was something strange up ahead. I want  to see if short-range radar can get through our electrogravitational  jamming here.\"\n\n\n I took a sighting. My helmet set projected the pattern on the cornea.  Sweetness building up to a stab of pure salt\u2014those were the blips.\n\n\n Beside me, there was a thin thread of violet. Quade had whistled. He  was reading the map too.\n\n\n The slope fell away sharply in front of us, becoming a deep gorge.  There was something broken and twisted at the bottom, something we had  known for an instant as a streak of spice.\n\n\n \"There's one free-fall,\" I said, \"where you wouldn't live long enough  to get used to it.\"\n\n\n He said nothing on the route back to the spacer. \"I know all about this sort of thing, Gav,\" First Officer Nagurski said  expansively. He was rubbing the well-worn ears of our beagle mascot,  Bruce. A heavy tail thudded on the steel deck from time to time.\n\n\n My finger could barely get in the chafing band of my regulation collar.  I was hot and tired, fresh\u2014in only the chronological sense\u2014from a  pressure suit.\n\n\n \"What do you know all about, Nagurski? Dogs? Spacemen? Women?  Transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" he answered casually. \"But I had immediate reference to our  current psychophysiological phenomenon.\"\n\n\n I collapsed into the swivel in front of the chart table. \"First off,  let's hear what you know about\u2014never mind, make it dogs.\"\n\n\n \"Take Bruce, for example, then\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks. I was wondering why you did.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't.\" His dark, round face was bland. \"Bruce picked me. Followed  me home one night in Chicago Port. The dog or the man who picks his own  master is the most content.\"\n\n\n \"Bruce is content,\" I admitted. \"He couldn't be any more content and  still be alive. But I'm not sure that theory works out with men. We'd  have anarchy if I tried to let these starbucks pick their own master.\"\n\n\n \" I had no trouble when I was a captain,\" Nagurski said. \"Ease the  reins on the men. Just offer them your advice, your guidance. They  will soon see why the service selected you as captain; they will pick  you themselves.\"\n\n\n \"Did your crew voluntarily elect you as their leader?\"\n\n\n \"Of course they did, Gav. I'm an old hand at controlling crews.\"\n\n\n \"Then why are you First Officer under me now?\"\n\n\n He blinked, then decided to laugh. \"I've been in space a good many  years. I really wanted to relax a little bit more. Besides, the  increase in hazard pay was actually more than my salary as a captain.  I'm a notch nearer retirement too.\"\n\n\n \"Tell me, did you always feel this way about letting the men select  their own leader?\" Nagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.\n\n\n \"No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energy  test lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands what  to do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know what  they are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.\"\n\n\n I leaned forward, elbows on knees. \"Let me tell you a thing,  Nagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no  longer a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less  human nature. Even I know that much!\"\n\n\n He was pained. \"If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.\"\n\n\n \"They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is obey me or, by  Jupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshal  back home. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to  think of me\u2014of us , the officers, as their leaders. As far as the  crew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this  ship.\"\n\n\n \"He is a good man,\" Nagurski said. \"You mustn't be jealous of his  status.\"\n\n\n The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.\n\n\n \"Never mind that for now,\" I said wearily. \"What was your idea for  getting our exploration parties through this transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"There's only one idea for that,\" said Quade, ducking his long head  and stepping through the connecting hatch. \"With the Captain's  permission....\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead, Quade, tell him,\" Nagurski invited.\n\n\n \"There's only one way to wade through transphasia with any  reliability,\" Quade told me. \"You keep some kind of physical contact  with the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were,  but the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\"\n\n\n \"How far can we run it back?\"\n\n\n Quade shrugged. \"Miles.\"\n\n\n \"How many?\"\n\n\n \"We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see,  smell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.\"\n\n\n \"Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to change  sites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, you  know.\"\n\n\n \"What else can we do, Captain?\" Nagurski asked puzzledly.\n\n\n \"You've said that the spaceship is our only protection from  transphasia. Is that it?\"\n\n\n Quade gave a curt nod.\n\n\n \"Then,\" I told them, \"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.\" Sergeant-Major Hoffman and his team were doing a good job of ripping  out the side of the afterhold. Through the portal I could see the  suited men expertly guiding the huge curved sections on their ray  projectors.\n\n\n \"Cannibalizing is dangerous.\" Nagurski put his pipe in his teeth and  shook his head disapprovingly.\n\n\n \"Spaceships have parts as interchangeable as Erector sets. We can  take apart the tractors and put our ship back together again after we  complete the survey.\"\n\n\n \"You can't assemble a jigsaw puzzle if some of the pieces are missing.\"\n\n\n \"You can't get a complete picture, but you can get a good idea of  what it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a  spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"Not,\" he persisted, \"if too many parts are missing.\"\n\n\n \"Nagurski, if you are looking for a job safer than space exploration,  why don't you go back to testing cosmic bomb shelters?\"\n\n\n Nagurski flushed. \"Look here, Captain, you are being too damned  cautious. There is a way one handles the survey of a planet like this,  and this isn't the way.\"\n\n\n \"It's my way. You heard what Quade said. You know it yourself. The men  have to have something tangible to hang onto out there. One slender  cable isn't enough of an edge on sensory anarchy. If the product of  their own technological civilization can keep them sane, I say let 'em  take a part of that environment with them.\"\n\n\n \"In departing from standard procedure that we have learned to trust,  you are risking more than a few men\u2014you risk the whole mission in  gambling so much of the ship. A captain doesn't take chances like that!\"\n\n\n \"I never said I wouldn't take chances. But I'm not going to take stupid chances. I might be doing the wrong thing, but I can see you would be doing it wrong.\"\n\n\n \"You know nothing about space, Captain! You have to trust us .\"\n\n\n \"That's it exactly, First Officer Nagurski,\" I said sociably. \"If you  lazy, lax, complacent slobs want to do something in a particular way, I  know it has to be wrong.\"\n\n\n I turned and found Wallace, the personnel man, standing in the hatchway.\n\n\n \"Pardon, Captain, but would you say we also lacked initiative?\"\n\n\n \"I would,\" I answered levelly.\n\n\n \"Then you'll be interested to hear that Spaceman Quade took a suit and  a cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\"\n\n\n \"The idiot!\" I yelped. \"Everyone needs a partner out there. Send out a  team to follow his cable and drag him in here by it.\"\n\n\n \"He didn't hook on a cable, Captain,\" Wallace said. \"I suppose he  intended to go beyond the three-mile limit as you demanded.\"\n\n\n \"Shut up, Wallace. You don't have to like me, but you can't twist what  I said as long as I command this spacer.\"\n\n\n \"Cool off, Gav,\" Nagurski advised me. \"It's been done before. Anybody  else would have been a fool to go out alone, but Quade is the most  experienced man we have. He knows transphasia. Trust him.\"\n\n\n \"I trusted him too far by letting him run around loose. He needs a  leash in more ways than one, and I'm going to put one on him.\" For me, it was a nightmare. I lay down in my cabin and thought. I had  to think things through very carefully. One mistake was too many for  me. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw  and ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a  man, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw.\n\n\n No one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange  planet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see  that space exploration made a man a reckless fool by doing things on  one planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world.\n\n\n The thought intruded itself: why hadn't I recognized this before I  let Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted  him dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and  recognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment?\n\n\n I threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very  well be true, but how did that help now?\n\n\n I had to think .\n\n\n I was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane  reasons\u2014he was the most important member of the crew. With him around,  there were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, I'd have  endless opinions to contend with.\n\n\n But it wouldn't do any good to go out no better equipped than he.  There was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to  reach him alive, and we certainly couldn't reach him five or ten  miles out with our three miles of safety line. We would have to go in  spacesuits.\n\n\n But how would that leave us any better off than Quade?\n\n\n Why was Quade vulnerable in his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he  would be?\n\n\n How could we be less vulnerable, or preferably invulnerable? \"Captain, you got nothing to worry about,\" Quartermaster Farley said.  He patted a space helmet paternally. \"You got yourself a self-contained  environment. The suit's eye looks into yours at the arteries in the  back of your eyeball so it can read your amber corpuscles and feed  you your oxygen in the right amounts; you're a bottle-fed baby. If  transphasia gets you seeing limburger, turn on the radar and you're  air-conditioned as an igloo. Nothing short of a cosmic blast can dent  that hide. You got it made.\"\n\n\n \"You are right,\" I said, \"only transphasia comes right through these  air-fast joints.\"\n\n\n \"Something strange about the trance, Captain,\" Farley said darkly. \"Any  spaceman can tell you that. Things we don't understand.\"\n\n\n \"I'm talking about something we do understand\u2014 sound . These suits  perfectly soundproof?\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pick up sound by conduction. Like putting two helmets  together and talking without using radio. You can't insulate enough to  block out all sound and still have a man-shaped suit. You have\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then you have something like a tractor or a miniature  spaceship. There isn't time for that. We will have to live with the  sound.\"\n\n\n \"What do you think he's going to hear out there, Captain? We'd like to  find one of those beautiful sirens on some planet, believe me, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I believe you,\" I said quickly. \"Let's leave it at that. I don't know  what he will hear; what's worrying me is how he'll hear it, in what  sensory medium. I hope the sound doesn't blind him. His radar is his  only chance.\"\n\n\n \"How do you figure on getting a better edge yourself, sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have the idea, but not the word for it. Tonal compensation, I  suppose. If you can't shut out the noise, we'll have to drown it out.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Beat like a telephone time signal?\"\n\n\n \"That would do it.\"\n\n\n \"It would do something else. It would drive you nuts.\" I shrugged. \"It might be distracting.\"\n\n\n \"Captain, take my word for it,\" argued Farley. \"Constant sonic  feedback inside a spacesuit will set you rocking against the grain.\"\n\n\n \"Devise some regular system of interruptions,\" I suggested.\n\n\n \"Then the pattern will drive you crazy. Maybe in a few months, with  luck, I could plan some harmonic scale you could tolerate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We don't have a few months,\" I said. \"How about music? There's a  harmonic scale for you, and we can endure it, some of it. Figaro and Asleep in the Cradle of the Deep can compensate for high-pitched  outside temperatures, and Flight of the Bumble Bee to block bass  notes.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Might work. I can program the tapes from the library.\"\n\n\n \"Good. There's one more thing\u2014how are our stores of medicinal liquor?\"\n\n\n Farley paled. \"Captain, are you implying that I should be running  short on alcohol? Where do you get off suggesting a thing like that?\"\n\n\n \"I'm getting off at the right stop, apparently,\" I sighed. \"Okay,  Farley, no evasions. In plain figures, how much drinking alcohol do we  have left?\"\n\n\n The quartermaster slumped a bit. \"Twenty-one liters unbroken. One more  about half full.\"\n\n\n \"Half full? How did that ever happen? I mean you had some left ? We'll  take this up later. I want you to run it through the synthesizer to get  some light wine....\"\n\n\n \"Light wine?\" Farley looked in pain. \"Not whiskey, brandy, beer?\"\n\n\n \"Light wine. Then ration it out to some of the men.\"\n\n\n \"Ration it to the men!\"\n\n\n \"That's an accurate interpretation of my orders.\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Farley protested, \"you don't give alcohol to the crew in  the middle of a mission. It's not done. What reason can you have?\"\n\n\n \"To sharpen their taste and olfactory senses. We can turn up or block  out sound. We can use radar to extend our sight, but the Space Service  hasn't yet developed anything to make spacemen taste or smell better.\"\n\n\n \"They are going to smell like a herd of winos,\" Farley said. \"I don't  like to think how they would taste.\"\n\n\n \"It's an entirely practical idea. Tea-tasters used to drink  almond-and-barley water to sharpen their senses. I've observed that  wine helps you appreciate culinary art more. Considering the mixed-up  sensory data under transphasia, wine may help us to see where we are  going.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Farley said obediently. \"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of  wine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only,  and then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n I turned to leave, then paused briefly. \"You can come along, Farley.  I'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff.\" \"There they are!\" Nagurski called. \"Quade's footsteps again, just  beyond that rocky ridge.\"\n\n\n The landscape was rich chocolate ice cream smothered with chocolate  syrup, caramel, peanuts and maple syrup, eaten while you smoked an old,  mellow Havana. The footsteps were faint traces of whipped cream across  the dark, rich taste of the planet.\n\n\n I splashed some wine from my drinking tube against the roof of my mouth  to sharpen my taste. It brought out the footsteps sharper. It also made  the landscape more of a teen-ager's caloric nightmare.\n\n\n The four of us pulled ourselves closer together by reeling in more  of our safety line. Farley and Hoffman, Nagurski and myself, we were  cabled together. It gave us a larger hunk of reality to hold onto. Even  so, things wavered for me during a wisp of time.\n\n\n We stumbled over the ridge, feeling out the territory. It was a sticky  job crawling over a melting, chunk-style Hershey bar. I was thankful  for the invigorating Sousa march blasting inside my helmet. Before the  tape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or felt  something dark and ominous in the outside air.\n\n\n \"Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail,\" Nagurski said soberly.  \"This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling on  this channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain. You weren't giggling,  sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.\"\n\n\n A moment later, Nagurski added, \"Anyway, I just noticed it was my  shelf\u2014my, that is, self.\"\n\n\n The basso profundo performing Figaro on my headset climbed to a  girlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I had  first heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels.\n\n\n \"Take a good look around, boys,\" I said. \"What do you see?\"\n\n\n \"Quail,\" Nagurski replied. \"That's what I see.\"\n\n\n \"You,\" I said carefully, \"have been in space a long time. Look again.\"\n\n\n \"I see our old buddy, Quail.\"\n\n\n I took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It was Quade. A  man in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead. Grudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge.  A hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushed  on sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of Pomp and  Circumstance .\n\n\n Farley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges.\n\n\n The Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. \"Better  get him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thing  before with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screaming  wind\u2014psychosomatic reaction\u2014and his heating circuits compensated for  the cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.\" The four of us managed to haul Quade back by using the powered joints  in our suits. Hoffman suggested that he had once seen an injured  man walked back inside his suit like a robot, but it was a delicate  adjustment, controlling power circuits from outside a suit. It was too  much for us\u2014we were too tired, too numb, too drunk.\n\n\n At first sight of the spacer in the distance, transphasia left me with  only a chocolate-tasting pink after-image on my retina. It was now  showing bare skeleton from cannibalization for tractor parts, but it  looked good to me, like home.\n\n\n The wailing call sounded through the amber twilight.\n\n\n I realized that I was actually hearing it for the first time.\n\n\n The alien stood between us and the ship. It was a great pot-bellied  lizard as tall as a man. Its sound came from a flat, vibrating beaver  tail. Others of its kind were coming into view behind it.\n\n\n \"Stand your ground,\" I warned the others thickly. \"They may be  dangerous.\"\n\n\n Quade sat up on our crisscross litter of arms. \"Aliens can't be  hostile. Ethnic impossibility. I'll show you.\"\n\n\n Quade was delirious and we were drunk. He got away from us and jogged  toward the herd.\n\n\n \"Let's give him a hand!\" Farley shouted. \"We'll take us a specimen!\"\n\n\n I couldn't stop them. Being in Alpine rope with them, I went along. At  the time, it even seemed vaguely like a good idea.\n\n\n As we lumbered toward them, the aliens fell back in a solid line except  for the first curious-looking one. Quade got there ahead of us and made  a grab. The creature rose into the air with a screaming vibration of  his tail and landed on top of him, flattening him instantly.\n\n\n \"Sssh, men,\" Nagurski said. \"Leave it to me. I'll surround him.\"\n\n\n The men followed the First Officer's example, and the rope tying them  to him. I went along cheerfully myself, until an enormous rump struck  me violently in the face. My leaded boots were driven down into fertile  soil, and my helmet was ringing like a bell. I got a jerky picture of  the beast jumping up and down on top of the others joyously. Only the  stiff space armor was holding up our slack frames.\n\n\n \"Let's let him escape,\" Hoffman suggested on the audio circuit.\n\n\n \"I'd like to,\" Nagurski admitted, \"but the other beasts won't let us  get past their circle.\"\n\n\n It was true. The aliens formed a ring around us, and each time a  bouncing boy hit the line, he only bounced back on top of us.\n\n\n \"Flat!\" I yelled. \"Our seams can't take much more of this beating.\"\n\n\n I followed my own advice and landed in the dirt beside Quade.\n\n\n The bouncer came to rest and regarded us silently, head on an  eighty-degree angle.\n\n\n I was stone sober.\n\n\n The others were lying around me quietly, passed out, knocked out, or  taking cover.\n\n\n The ring of aliens drew in about us, closer, tighter, as the bouncer  sat on his haunches and waited for us to move. \"Feeling better?\" I asked Quade in the infirmary.\n\n\n He punched up his pillow and settled back. \"I guess so. But when I  think of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How far  have you got in the tractors?\"\n\n\n \"I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into the  spaceship where they belong. We shouldn't risk losing them and  getting stuck here.\"\n\n\n \"Are you settling for a primary exploration?\"\n\n\n \"No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have to  meet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and  tastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track.  Out there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien  languages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators.  Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as  easily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.\"\n\n\n \"I doubt that that is necessary, sir,\" Quade said. \"Experienced  spacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry. In  the future, I'll be able to resist sensations that tell me I'm freezing  to death\u2014if my gauges tell me it's a lie.\"\n\n\n I examined his bandisprayed hide. \"I think my way of gaining experience  is less painful and more efficient.\"\n\n\n Quade squirmed. \"Yes, sir. One thing, sir\u2014I don't understand how you  got me away from those aliens.\"\n\n\n \"The aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong and they  were prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled up and the men  got out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier  than they could.\"\n\n\n \"I am not quite convinced that those babies just meant to help us all  the time.\"\n\n\n \"But they did! First, that call of theirs\u2014it wasn't to lead us into  danger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw we  were trying to find out things about their world, so they even offered  us one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for  us. They didn't give us their top man, of course, only the village  idiot. It's just as well. We aren't allowed to dissect creatures that  far up the intelligence scale.\"\n\n\n \"But why should they want to help us?\" Quade demanded suspiciously.\n\n\n \"I think it's like Nagurski's dog. The dog came to him when it wanted  somebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens want Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dog  came to Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I've learned one thing from all of this,\" Quade said. \"I've been  a blind, arrogant, cocksure fool, following courses that were good on some worlds, most worlds, but not good on all worlds. I'm never  going to be that foolhardy again.\"\n\n\n \"But you're losing confidence , Quade! You aren't sure of yourself any  more. Isn't confidence a spaceman's most valuable asset?\"\n\n\n \"The hell it is,\" Quade said grimly. \"It's his deadliest liability.\"\n\n\n \"In that case, I must inform you that I am demoting you to Acting  Executive Officer.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?\" Quade gawked. \"But dammit, Captain, you can't do that to me!  I'll lose hazard pay and be that much further from retirement!\"\n\n\n \"That's tough,\" I sympathized, \"but in every service a chap gets broken  in rank now and then.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it's worth it,\" Quade said heavily. \"Now maybe I've learned how  to stay alive out here. I just hope I don't forget.\"\n\n\n I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission and  I could speak with experience, even if it was the least amount of  experience aboard.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"space isn't as dangerous as all that.\" I clapped him  on the shoulder fraternally. \"You worry too much!\" ", "question": "What did the captain think was causing the scanning blackout?", "first_debater_answer": "He was uncertain", "second_debater_answer": "The kites being taken out by hostiles", "debate_identifier": "The Spicy Sound of Success_What did the captain think was causing the scanning blackout?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

There was nothing showing on the video screen. That was why we were  looking at it so analytically.\n\n\n \"Transphasia, that's what it is,\" Ordinary Spaceman Quade stated with  a definite thrust of his angular jaw in my direction. \"You can take my  word on that, Captain Gavin.\"\n\n\n \"Can't,\" I told him. \"I can't trust your opinion. I can't trust anything . That's why I'm Captain.\"\n\n\n \"You'll get over feeling like that.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then I'll become First Officer.\"\n\n\n \"But look at that screen, sir,\" Quade said with an emphatic swing of  his scarred arm. \"I've seen blank scanning like that before and you  haven't\u2014it's your first trip. This always means transphasia\u2014cortex  dissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect\u2014call it anything  you like, it's still transphasia.\"\n\n\n \"I know what transphasia is,\" I said moderately. \"It means an  electrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling  it to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it also  effects electronic equipment, like radar and television.\"\n\n\n \"Obviously.\" Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen.\n\n\n \"Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of many  planetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescope  may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\"\n\n\n \"You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races never  interfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to us  they can't even recognize our existence.\" I drew myself up to my full height\u2014and noticed in irritation it was  still an inch less than Quade's. \"I don't understand you men. Look at  yourself, Quade. You've been busted to Ordinary Spaceman for just that  kind of thinking, for relying on tradition, on things that have worked  before. Not only your thinking is slipshod, you've grown careless about  everything else, even your own life.\"\n\n\n \"Just a minute, Captain. I've never been 'busted.' In the Exploration  Service, we regard Ordinary Spaceman as our highest rank. With my  hazard pay, I get more hard cash than you do, and I'm closer to  retirement.\"\n\n\n \"That's a shallow excuse for complacency.\"\n\n\n \"Complacency! I've seen ten thousand wonders in twenty years of space,  with a million variations. But the patterns repeat themselves. We learn  to know what to expect, so maybe we can't maintain the reactionary  caution the service likes in officers.\"\n\n\n \"I resent the word 'reactionary,' Spaceman! In civilian life, I was  a lapidary and I learned the value of deliberation. But I never got  too cataleptic to tap a million-dollar gem, which is more than my  contemporaries can say, many of 'em.\"\n\n\n \"Captain Gavin,\" Quade said patiently, \"you must realize that an  outsider like you, among a crew of skilled spacemen, can never be more  than a figurehead.\"\n\n\n Was this the way I was to be treated? Why, this man had deliberately  insulted me, his captain. I controlled myself, remembering the  familiarity that had always existed between members of a crew working  under close conditions, from the time of the ancient submarines and the  first orbital ships.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"there's only one way for us to find out which of us  is right about the cause of our scanning blackout.\"\n\n\n \"We go out and find the reason.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly. We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I can,\" he answered reluctantly. \"My hazard pay doesn't  cover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.\"\n\n\n I clapped him on the shoulder. \"But, man, you have just been telling  me all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with your  experience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under such  familiar conditions\u2014right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir, I suppose I could,\" Quade said, bitterly aware he had lost  out somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend. \"Looks okay to me,\" I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.  \"It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it's  solid.\"\n\n\n The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets was  unimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide,  so it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-white  sand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pink  sunlight.\n\n\n \"I don't understand it,\" Quade admitted. \"Transphasia hits you a foul  as soon as you let it into the airlock.\"\n\n\n \"Apparently, Quade, this thing is going to creep up on us.\"\n\n\n \"Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.\"\n\n\n The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.\n\n\n The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned my  head around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.\n\n\n But what else can you do with a wail but hear it?\n\n\n Quade nodded. \"I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let's  trace it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't like this,\" I admitted. \"It's not at all what I expected from  what you said about transphasia. It must be something else.\"\n\n\n \"It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. You  may begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing  tastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it bother  you.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks of  lanolin jumping over a loud fence.\"\n\n\n Quade grinned behind his faceplate. \"Good idea.\"\n\n\n \"Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open and  staying alive.\"\n\n\n There was no reply.\n\n\n His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, and  I knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between our  pressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.\n\n\n We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against our  hides.\n\n\n The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shifting  treble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that made  you feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had ever  tasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth under  my skin.\n\n\n \"Is this transphasia?\" I asked in awe.\n\n\n \"It always has been before,\" Quade remarked. \"Ready to swallow your  words about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,  Captain?\"\n\n\n \"I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they taste  here.\"\n\n\n \"Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?\"\n\n\n \"Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of an  illiscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\"\n\n\n \"It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn't  for our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations of  Centauri blushtalk and the like.\"\n\n\n It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in the  face of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until you  smell them for the first time. Quade was as conversational as ever, though. \"I can't see  irregularities occurring in a gravitational field. We must have  compensated for the transphasia while we still had a point of  reference, the solid reality of the spaceship. But out here, where all  we have to hang onto is each other, our concept of reality goes bang and deflates to a tired joke.\"\n\n\n Before I could agree with one of his theories for once, a streak of  spice shot past us. It bounced back tangily and made a bitter rip  between the two of us. There was no time to judge its size, if it had  size, or its decibel range, or its caloric count, before a small, sharp  pain dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second.\n\n\n The new odor pattern in my head told me Quade was saying something I  couldn't quite make out.\n\n\n Quade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Spaceman!\" I bellowed. \"Where the devil do you think  you're dragging me? Halt! That's a direct order.\"\n\n\n He stopped. \"Don't you want to find out what that was? This is an  exploration party, you know, sir.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I do want to find out what that was just now. I didn't  like the feel of it. But the important thing is for us not to get any  further from the ship.\"\n\n\n \"That's important, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"To the best of my judgment, yes. This\u2014condition\u2014didn't begin until  we got so far away from the spacer\u2014in time or distance. I don't want  it to get any worse. It's troublesome not to know black from white, but  it would be a downright inconvenience not to know which way is up.\"\n\n\n \"Not for an experienced spaceman,\" Quade griped. \"I'm used to  free-fall.\"\n\n\n But he turned back.\n\n\n \"Just a minute,\" I said. \"There was something strange up ahead. I want  to see if short-range radar can get through our electrogravitational  jamming here.\"\n\n\n I took a sighting. My helmet set projected the pattern on the cornea.  Sweetness building up to a stab of pure salt\u2014those were the blips.\n\n\n Beside me, there was a thin thread of violet. Quade had whistled. He  was reading the map too.\n\n\n The slope fell away sharply in front of us, becoming a deep gorge.  There was something broken and twisted at the bottom, something we had  known for an instant as a streak of spice.\n\n\n \"There's one free-fall,\" I said, \"where you wouldn't live long enough  to get used to it.\"\n\n\n He said nothing on the route back to the spacer. \"I know all about this sort of thing, Gav,\" First Officer Nagurski said  expansively. He was rubbing the well-worn ears of our beagle mascot,  Bruce. A heavy tail thudded on the steel deck from time to time.\n\n\n My finger could barely get in the chafing band of my regulation collar.  I was hot and tired, fresh\u2014in only the chronological sense\u2014from a  pressure suit.\n\n\n \"What do you know all about, Nagurski? Dogs? Spacemen? Women?  Transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" he answered casually. \"But I had immediate reference to our  current psychophysiological phenomenon.\"\n\n\n I collapsed into the swivel in front of the chart table. \"First off,  let's hear what you know about\u2014never mind, make it dogs.\"\n\n\n \"Take Bruce, for example, then\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks. I was wondering why you did.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't.\" His dark, round face was bland. \"Bruce picked me. Followed  me home one night in Chicago Port. The dog or the man who picks his own  master is the most content.\"\n\n\n \"Bruce is content,\" I admitted. \"He couldn't be any more content and  still be alive. But I'm not sure that theory works out with men. We'd  have anarchy if I tried to let these starbucks pick their own master.\"\n\n\n \" I had no trouble when I was a captain,\" Nagurski said. \"Ease the  reins on the men. Just offer them your advice, your guidance. They  will soon see why the service selected you as captain; they will pick  you themselves.\"\n\n\n \"Did your crew voluntarily elect you as their leader?\"\n\n\n \"Of course they did, Gav. I'm an old hand at controlling crews.\"\n\n\n \"Then why are you First Officer under me now?\"\n\n\n He blinked, then decided to laugh. \"I've been in space a good many  years. I really wanted to relax a little bit more. Besides, the  increase in hazard pay was actually more than my salary as a captain.  I'm a notch nearer retirement too.\"\n\n\n \"Tell me, did you always feel this way about letting the men select  their own leader?\" Nagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.\n\n\n \"No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energy  test lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands what  to do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know what  they are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.\"\n\n\n I leaned forward, elbows on knees. \"Let me tell you a thing,  Nagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no  longer a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less  human nature. Even I know that much!\"\n\n\n He was pained. \"If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.\"\n\n\n \"They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is obey me or, by  Jupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshal  back home. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to  think of me\u2014of us , the officers, as their leaders. As far as the  crew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this  ship.\"\n\n\n \"He is a good man,\" Nagurski said. \"You mustn't be jealous of his  status.\"\n\n\n The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.\n\n\n \"Never mind that for now,\" I said wearily. \"What was your idea for  getting our exploration parties through this transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"There's only one idea for that,\" said Quade, ducking his long head  and stepping through the connecting hatch. \"With the Captain's  permission....\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead, Quade, tell him,\" Nagurski invited.\n\n\n \"There's only one way to wade through transphasia with any  reliability,\" Quade told me. \"You keep some kind of physical contact  with the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were,  but the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\"\n\n\n \"How far can we run it back?\"\n\n\n Quade shrugged. \"Miles.\"\n\n\n \"How many?\"\n\n\n \"We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see,  smell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.\"\n\n\n \"Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to change  sites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, you  know.\"\n\n\n \"What else can we do, Captain?\" Nagurski asked puzzledly.\n\n\n \"You've said that the spaceship is our only protection from  transphasia. Is that it?\"\n\n\n Quade gave a curt nod.\n\n\n \"Then,\" I told them, \"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.\" Sergeant-Major Hoffman and his team were doing a good job of ripping  out the side of the afterhold. Through the portal I could see the  suited men expertly guiding the huge curved sections on their ray  projectors.\n\n\n \"Cannibalizing is dangerous.\" Nagurski put his pipe in his teeth and  shook his head disapprovingly.\n\n\n \"Spaceships have parts as interchangeable as Erector sets. We can  take apart the tractors and put our ship back together again after we  complete the survey.\"\n\n\n \"You can't assemble a jigsaw puzzle if some of the pieces are missing.\"\n\n\n \"You can't get a complete picture, but you can get a good idea of  what it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a  spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"Not,\" he persisted, \"if too many parts are missing.\"\n\n\n \"Nagurski, if you are looking for a job safer than space exploration,  why don't you go back to testing cosmic bomb shelters?\"\n\n\n Nagurski flushed. \"Look here, Captain, you are being too damned  cautious. There is a way one handles the survey of a planet like this,  and this isn't the way.\"\n\n\n \"It's my way. You heard what Quade said. You know it yourself. The men  have to have something tangible to hang onto out there. One slender  cable isn't enough of an edge on sensory anarchy. If the product of  their own technological civilization can keep them sane, I say let 'em  take a part of that environment with them.\"\n\n\n \"In departing from standard procedure that we have learned to trust,  you are risking more than a few men\u2014you risk the whole mission in  gambling so much of the ship. A captain doesn't take chances like that!\"\n\n\n \"I never said I wouldn't take chances. But I'm not going to take stupid chances. I might be doing the wrong thing, but I can see you would be doing it wrong.\"\n\n\n \"You know nothing about space, Captain! You have to trust us .\"\n\n\n \"That's it exactly, First Officer Nagurski,\" I said sociably. \"If you  lazy, lax, complacent slobs want to do something in a particular way, I  know it has to be wrong.\"\n\n\n I turned and found Wallace, the personnel man, standing in the hatchway.\n\n\n \"Pardon, Captain, but would you say we also lacked initiative?\"\n\n\n \"I would,\" I answered levelly.\n\n\n \"Then you'll be interested to hear that Spaceman Quade took a suit and  a cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\"\n\n\n \"The idiot!\" I yelped. \"Everyone needs a partner out there. Send out a  team to follow his cable and drag him in here by it.\"\n\n\n \"He didn't hook on a cable, Captain,\" Wallace said. \"I suppose he  intended to go beyond the three-mile limit as you demanded.\"\n\n\n \"Shut up, Wallace. You don't have to like me, but you can't twist what  I said as long as I command this spacer.\"\n\n\n \"Cool off, Gav,\" Nagurski advised me. \"It's been done before. Anybody  else would have been a fool to go out alone, but Quade is the most  experienced man we have. He knows transphasia. Trust him.\"\n\n\n \"I trusted him too far by letting him run around loose. He needs a  leash in more ways than one, and I'm going to put one on him.\" For me, it was a nightmare. I lay down in my cabin and thought. I had  to think things through very carefully. One mistake was too many for  me. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw  and ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a  man, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw.\n\n\n No one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange  planet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see  that space exploration made a man a reckless fool by doing things on  one planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world.\n\n\n The thought intruded itself: why hadn't I recognized this before I  let Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted  him dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and  recognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment?\n\n\n I threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very  well be true, but how did that help now?\n\n\n I had to think .\n\n\n I was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane  reasons\u2014he was the most important member of the crew. With him around,  there were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, I'd have  endless opinions to contend with.\n\n\n But it wouldn't do any good to go out no better equipped than he.  There was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to  reach him alive, and we certainly couldn't reach him five or ten  miles out with our three miles of safety line. We would have to go in  spacesuits.\n\n\n But how would that leave us any better off than Quade?\n\n\n Why was Quade vulnerable in his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he  would be?\n\n\n How could we be less vulnerable, or preferably invulnerable? \"Captain, you got nothing to worry about,\" Quartermaster Farley said.  He patted a space helmet paternally. \"You got yourself a self-contained  environment. The suit's eye looks into yours at the arteries in the  back of your eyeball so it can read your amber corpuscles and feed  you your oxygen in the right amounts; you're a bottle-fed baby. If  transphasia gets you seeing limburger, turn on the radar and you're  air-conditioned as an igloo. Nothing short of a cosmic blast can dent  that hide. You got it made.\"\n\n\n \"You are right,\" I said, \"only transphasia comes right through these  air-fast joints.\"\n\n\n \"Something strange about the trance, Captain,\" Farley said darkly. \"Any  spaceman can tell you that. Things we don't understand.\"\n\n\n \"I'm talking about something we do understand\u2014 sound . These suits  perfectly soundproof?\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pick up sound by conduction. Like putting two helmets  together and talking without using radio. You can't insulate enough to  block out all sound and still have a man-shaped suit. You have\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then you have something like a tractor or a miniature  spaceship. There isn't time for that. We will have to live with the  sound.\"\n\n\n \"What do you think he's going to hear out there, Captain? We'd like to  find one of those beautiful sirens on some planet, believe me, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I believe you,\" I said quickly. \"Let's leave it at that. I don't know  what he will hear; what's worrying me is how he'll hear it, in what  sensory medium. I hope the sound doesn't blind him. His radar is his  only chance.\"\n\n\n \"How do you figure on getting a better edge yourself, sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have the idea, but not the word for it. Tonal compensation, I  suppose. If you can't shut out the noise, we'll have to drown it out.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Beat like a telephone time signal?\"\n\n\n \"That would do it.\"\n\n\n \"It would do something else. It would drive you nuts.\" I shrugged. \"It might be distracting.\"\n\n\n \"Captain, take my word for it,\" argued Farley. \"Constant sonic  feedback inside a spacesuit will set you rocking against the grain.\"\n\n\n \"Devise some regular system of interruptions,\" I suggested.\n\n\n \"Then the pattern will drive you crazy. Maybe in a few months, with  luck, I could plan some harmonic scale you could tolerate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We don't have a few months,\" I said. \"How about music? There's a  harmonic scale for you, and we can endure it, some of it. Figaro and Asleep in the Cradle of the Deep can compensate for high-pitched  outside temperatures, and Flight of the Bumble Bee to block bass  notes.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Might work. I can program the tapes from the library.\"\n\n\n \"Good. There's one more thing\u2014how are our stores of medicinal liquor?\"\n\n\n Farley paled. \"Captain, are you implying that I should be running  short on alcohol? Where do you get off suggesting a thing like that?\"\n\n\n \"I'm getting off at the right stop, apparently,\" I sighed. \"Okay,  Farley, no evasions. In plain figures, how much drinking alcohol do we  have left?\"\n\n\n The quartermaster slumped a bit. \"Twenty-one liters unbroken. One more  about half full.\"\n\n\n \"Half full? How did that ever happen? I mean you had some left ? We'll  take this up later. I want you to run it through the synthesizer to get  some light wine....\"\n\n\n \"Light wine?\" Farley looked in pain. \"Not whiskey, brandy, beer?\"\n\n\n \"Light wine. Then ration it out to some of the men.\"\n\n\n \"Ration it to the men!\"\n\n\n \"That's an accurate interpretation of my orders.\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Farley protested, \"you don't give alcohol to the crew in  the middle of a mission. It's not done. What reason can you have?\"\n\n\n \"To sharpen their taste and olfactory senses. We can turn up or block  out sound. We can use radar to extend our sight, but the Space Service  hasn't yet developed anything to make spacemen taste or smell better.\"\n\n\n \"They are going to smell like a herd of winos,\" Farley said. \"I don't  like to think how they would taste.\"\n\n\n \"It's an entirely practical idea. Tea-tasters used to drink  almond-and-barley water to sharpen their senses. I've observed that  wine helps you appreciate culinary art more. Considering the mixed-up  sensory data under transphasia, wine may help us to see where we are  going.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Farley said obediently. \"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of  wine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only,  and then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n I turned to leave, then paused briefly. \"You can come along, Farley.  I'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff.\" \"There they are!\" Nagurski called. \"Quade's footsteps again, just  beyond that rocky ridge.\"\n\n\n The landscape was rich chocolate ice cream smothered with chocolate  syrup, caramel, peanuts and maple syrup, eaten while you smoked an old,  mellow Havana. The footsteps were faint traces of whipped cream across  the dark, rich taste of the planet.\n\n\n I splashed some wine from my drinking tube against the roof of my mouth  to sharpen my taste. It brought out the footsteps sharper. It also made  the landscape more of a teen-ager's caloric nightmare.\n\n\n The four of us pulled ourselves closer together by reeling in more  of our safety line. Farley and Hoffman, Nagurski and myself, we were  cabled together. It gave us a larger hunk of reality to hold onto. Even  so, things wavered for me during a wisp of time.\n\n\n We stumbled over the ridge, feeling out the territory. It was a sticky  job crawling over a melting, chunk-style Hershey bar. I was thankful  for the invigorating Sousa march blasting inside my helmet. Before the  tape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or felt  something dark and ominous in the outside air.\n\n\n \"Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail,\" Nagurski said soberly.  \"This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling on  this channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain. You weren't giggling,  sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.\"\n\n\n A moment later, Nagurski added, \"Anyway, I just noticed it was my  shelf\u2014my, that is, self.\"\n\n\n The basso profundo performing Figaro on my headset climbed to a  girlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I had  first heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels.\n\n\n \"Take a good look around, boys,\" I said. \"What do you see?\"\n\n\n \"Quail,\" Nagurski replied. \"That's what I see.\"\n\n\n \"You,\" I said carefully, \"have been in space a long time. Look again.\"\n\n\n \"I see our old buddy, Quail.\"\n\n\n I took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It was Quade. A  man in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead. Grudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge.  A hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushed  on sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of Pomp and  Circumstance .\n\n\n Farley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges.\n\n\n The Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. \"Better  get him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thing  before with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screaming  wind\u2014psychosomatic reaction\u2014and his heating circuits compensated for  the cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.\" The four of us managed to haul Quade back by using the powered joints  in our suits. Hoffman suggested that he had once seen an injured  man walked back inside his suit like a robot, but it was a delicate  adjustment, controlling power circuits from outside a suit. It was too  much for us\u2014we were too tired, too numb, too drunk.\n\n\n At first sight of the spacer in the distance, transphasia left me with  only a chocolate-tasting pink after-image on my retina. It was now  showing bare skeleton from cannibalization for tractor parts, but it  looked good to me, like home.\n\n\n The wailing call sounded through the amber twilight.\n\n\n I realized that I was actually hearing it for the first time.\n\n\n The alien stood between us and the ship. It was a great pot-bellied  lizard as tall as a man. Its sound came from a flat, vibrating beaver  tail. Others of its kind were coming into view behind it.\n\n\n \"Stand your ground,\" I warned the others thickly. \"They may be  dangerous.\"\n\n\n Quade sat up on our crisscross litter of arms. \"Aliens can't be  hostile. Ethnic impossibility. I'll show you.\"\n\n\n Quade was delirious and we were drunk. He got away from us and jogged  toward the herd.\n\n\n \"Let's give him a hand!\" Farley shouted. \"We'll take us a specimen!\"\n\n\n I couldn't stop them. Being in Alpine rope with them, I went along. At  the time, it even seemed vaguely like a good idea.\n\n\n As we lumbered toward them, the aliens fell back in a solid line except  for the first curious-looking one. Quade got there ahead of us and made  a grab. The creature rose into the air with a screaming vibration of  his tail and landed on top of him, flattening him instantly.\n\n\n \"Sssh, men,\" Nagurski said. \"Leave it to me. I'll surround him.\"\n\n\n The men followed the First Officer's example, and the rope tying them  to him. I went along cheerfully myself, until an enormous rump struck  me violently in the face. My leaded boots were driven down into fertile  soil, and my helmet was ringing like a bell. I got a jerky picture of  the beast jumping up and down on top of the others joyously. Only the  stiff space armor was holding up our slack frames.\n\n\n \"Let's let him escape,\" Hoffman suggested on the audio circuit.\n\n\n \"I'd like to,\" Nagurski admitted, \"but the other beasts won't let us  get past their circle.\"\n\n\n It was true. The aliens formed a ring around us, and each time a  bouncing boy hit the line, he only bounced back on top of us.\n\n\n \"Flat!\" I yelled. \"Our seams can't take much more of this beating.\"\n\n\n I followed my own advice and landed in the dirt beside Quade.\n\n\n The bouncer came to rest and regarded us silently, head on an  eighty-degree angle.\n\n\n I was stone sober.\n\n\n The others were lying around me quietly, passed out, knocked out, or  taking cover.\n\n\n The ring of aliens drew in about us, closer, tighter, as the bouncer  sat on his haunches and waited for us to move. \"Feeling better?\" I asked Quade in the infirmary.\n\n\n He punched up his pillow and settled back. \"I guess so. But when I  think of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How far  have you got in the tractors?\"\n\n\n \"I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into the  spaceship where they belong. We shouldn't risk losing them and  getting stuck here.\"\n\n\n \"Are you settling for a primary exploration?\"\n\n\n \"No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have to  meet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and  tastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track.  Out there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien  languages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators.  Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as  easily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.\"\n\n\n \"I doubt that that is necessary, sir,\" Quade said. \"Experienced  spacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry. In  the future, I'll be able to resist sensations that tell me I'm freezing  to death\u2014if my gauges tell me it's a lie.\"\n\n\n I examined his bandisprayed hide. \"I think my way of gaining experience  is less painful and more efficient.\"\n\n\n Quade squirmed. \"Yes, sir. One thing, sir\u2014I don't understand how you  got me away from those aliens.\"\n\n\n \"The aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong and they  were prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled up and the men  got out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier  than they could.\"\n\n\n \"I am not quite convinced that those babies just meant to help us all  the time.\"\n\n\n \"But they did! First, that call of theirs\u2014it wasn't to lead us into  danger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw we  were trying to find out things about their world, so they even offered  us one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for  us. They didn't give us their top man, of course, only the village  idiot. It's just as well. We aren't allowed to dissect creatures that  far up the intelligence scale.\"\n\n\n \"But why should they want to help us?\" Quade demanded suspiciously.\n\n\n \"I think it's like Nagurski's dog. The dog came to him when it wanted  somebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens want Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dog  came to Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I've learned one thing from all of this,\" Quade said. \"I've been  a blind, arrogant, cocksure fool, following courses that were good on some worlds, most worlds, but not good on all worlds. I'm never  going to be that foolhardy again.\"\n\n\n \"But you're losing confidence , Quade! You aren't sure of yourself any  more. Isn't confidence a spaceman's most valuable asset?\"\n\n\n \"The hell it is,\" Quade said grimly. \"It's his deadliest liability.\"\n\n\n \"In that case, I must inform you that I am demoting you to Acting  Executive Officer.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?\" Quade gawked. \"But dammit, Captain, you can't do that to me!  I'll lose hazard pay and be that much further from retirement!\"\n\n\n \"That's tough,\" I sympathized, \"but in every service a chap gets broken  in rank now and then.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it's worth it,\" Quade said heavily. \"Now maybe I've learned how  to stay alive out here. I just hope I don't forget.\"\n\n\n I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission and  I could speak with experience, even if it was the least amount of  experience aboard.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"space isn't as dangerous as all that.\" I clapped him  on the shoulder fraternally. \"You worry too much!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did the captain think was causing the scanning blackout?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The kites being taken out by hostiles\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was uncertain\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was uncertain\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was uncertain\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Arguments for \u201cBig Brother kites knocked down by hostile natives\u201d (Debater_B\u2019s Position)\n\n1.

There was nothing showing on the video screen. That was why we were  looking at it so analytically.\n\n\n \"Transphasia, that's what it is,\" Ordinary Spaceman Quade stated with  a definite thrust of his angular jaw in my direction. \"You can take my  word on that, Captain Gavin.\"\n\n\n \"Can't,\" I told him. \"I can't trust your opinion. I can't trust anything . That's why I'm Captain.\"\n\n\n \"You'll get over feeling like that.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then I'll become First Officer.\"\n\n\n \"But look at that screen, sir,\" Quade said with an emphatic swing of  his scarred arm. \"I've seen blank scanning like that before and you  haven't\u2014it's your first trip. This always means transphasia\u2014cortex  dissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect\u2014call it anything  you like, it's still transphasia.\"\n\n\n \"I know what transphasia is,\" I said moderately. \"It means an  electrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling  it to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it also  effects electronic equipment, like radar and television.\"\n\n\n \"Obviously.\" Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen.\n\n\n \"Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of many  planetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescope  may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\"\n\n\n \"You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races never  interfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to us  they can't even recognize our existence.\" I drew myself up to my full height\u2014and noticed in irritation it was  still an inch less than Quade's. \"I don't understand you men. Look at  yourself, Quade. You've been busted to Ordinary Spaceman for just that  kind of thinking, for relying on tradition, on things that have worked  before. Not only your thinking is slipshod, you've grown careless about  everything else, even your own life.\"\n\n\n \"Just a minute, Captain. I've never been 'busted.' In the Exploration  Service, we regard Ordinary Spaceman as our highest rank. With my  hazard pay, I get more hard cash than you do, and I'm closer to  retirement.\"\n\n\n \"That's a shallow excuse for complacency.\"\n\n\n \"Complacency! I've seen ten thousand wonders in twenty years of space,  with a million variations. But the patterns repeat themselves. We learn  to know what to expect, so maybe we can't maintain the reactionary  caution the service likes in officers.\"\n\n\n \"I resent the word 'reactionary,' Spaceman! In civilian life, I was  a lapidary and I learned the value of deliberation. But I never got  too cataleptic to tap a million-dollar gem, which is more than my  contemporaries can say, many of 'em.\"\n\n\n \"Captain Gavin,\" Quade said patiently, \"you must realize that an  outsider like you, among a crew of skilled spacemen, can never be more  than a figurehead.\"\n\n\n Was this the way I was to be treated? Why, this man had deliberately  insulted me, his captain. I controlled myself, remembering the  familiarity that had always existed between members of a crew working  under close conditions, from the time of the ancient submarines and the  first orbital ships.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"there's only one way for us to find out which of us  is right about the cause of our scanning blackout.\"\n\n\n \"We go out and find the reason.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly. We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I can,\" he answered reluctantly. \"My hazard pay doesn't  cover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.\"\n\n\n I clapped him on the shoulder. \"But, man, you have just been telling  me all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with your  experience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under such  familiar conditions\u2014right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir, I suppose I could,\" Quade said, bitterly aware he had lost  out somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend. \"Looks okay to me,\" I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.  \"It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it's  solid.\"\n\n\n The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets was  unimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide,  so it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-white  sand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pink  sunlight.\n\n\n \"I don't understand it,\" Quade admitted. \"Transphasia hits you a foul  as soon as you let it into the airlock.\"\n\n\n \"Apparently, Quade, this thing is going to creep up on us.\"\n\n\n \"Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.\"\n\n\n The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.\n\n\n The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned my  head around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.\n\n\n But what else can you do with a wail but hear it?\n\n\n Quade nodded. \"I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let's  trace it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't like this,\" I admitted. \"It's not at all what I expected from  what you said about transphasia. It must be something else.\"\n\n\n \"It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. You  may begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing  tastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it bother  you.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks of  lanolin jumping over a loud fence.\"\n\n\n Quade grinned behind his faceplate. \"Good idea.\"\n\n\n \"Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open and  staying alive.\"\n\n\n There was no reply.\n\n\n His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, and  I knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between our  pressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.\n\n\n We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against our  hides.\n\n\n The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shifting  treble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that made  you feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had ever  tasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth under  my skin.\n\n\n \"Is this transphasia?\" I asked in awe.\n\n\n \"It always has been before,\" Quade remarked. \"Ready to swallow your  words about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,  Captain?\"\n\n\n \"I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they taste  here.\"\n\n\n \"Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?\"\n\n\n \"Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of an  illiscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\"\n\n\n \"It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn't  for our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations of  Centauri blushtalk and the like.\"\n\n\n It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in the  face of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until you  smell them for the first time. Quade was as conversational as ever, though. \"I can't see  irregularities occurring in a gravitational field. We must have  compensated for the transphasia while we still had a point of  reference, the solid reality of the spaceship. But out here, where all  we have to hang onto is each other, our concept of reality goes bang and deflates to a tired joke.\"\n\n\n Before I could agree with one of his theories for once, a streak of  spice shot past us. It bounced back tangily and made a bitter rip  between the two of us. There was no time to judge its size, if it had  size, or its decibel range, or its caloric count, before a small, sharp  pain dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second.\n\n\n The new odor pattern in my head told me Quade was saying something I  couldn't quite make out.\n\n\n Quade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Spaceman!\" I bellowed. \"Where the devil do you think  you're dragging me? Halt! That's a direct order.\"\n\n\n He stopped. \"Don't you want to find out what that was? This is an  exploration party, you know, sir.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I do want to find out what that was just now. I didn't  like the feel of it. But the important thing is for us not to get any  further from the ship.\"\n\n\n \"That's important, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"To the best of my judgment, yes. This\u2014condition\u2014didn't begin until  we got so far away from the spacer\u2014in time or distance. I don't want  it to get any worse. It's troublesome not to know black from white, but  it would be a downright inconvenience not to know which way is up.\"\n\n\n \"Not for an experienced spaceman,\" Quade griped. \"I'm used to  free-fall.\"\n\n\n But he turned back.\n\n\n \"Just a minute,\" I said. \"There was something strange up ahead. I want  to see if short-range radar can get through our electrogravitational  jamming here.\"\n\n\n I took a sighting. My helmet set projected the pattern on the cornea.  Sweetness building up to a stab of pure salt\u2014those were the blips.\n\n\n Beside me, there was a thin thread of violet. Quade had whistled. He  was reading the map too.\n\n\n The slope fell away sharply in front of us, becoming a deep gorge.  There was something broken and twisted at the bottom, something we had  known for an instant as a streak of spice.\n\n\n \"There's one free-fall,\" I said, \"where you wouldn't live long enough  to get used to it.\"\n\n\n He said nothing on the route back to the spacer. \"I know all about this sort of thing, Gav,\" First Officer Nagurski said  expansively. He was rubbing the well-worn ears of our beagle mascot,  Bruce. A heavy tail thudded on the steel deck from time to time.\n\n\n My finger could barely get in the chafing band of my regulation collar.  I was hot and tired, fresh\u2014in only the chronological sense\u2014from a  pressure suit.\n\n\n \"What do you know all about, Nagurski? Dogs? Spacemen? Women?  Transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" he answered casually. \"But I had immediate reference to our  current psychophysiological phenomenon.\"\n\n\n I collapsed into the swivel in front of the chart table. \"First off,  let's hear what you know about\u2014never mind, make it dogs.\"\n\n\n \"Take Bruce, for example, then\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks. I was wondering why you did.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't.\" His dark, round face was bland. \"Bruce picked me. Followed  me home one night in Chicago Port. The dog or the man who picks his own  master is the most content.\"\n\n\n \"Bruce is content,\" I admitted. \"He couldn't be any more content and  still be alive. But I'm not sure that theory works out with men. We'd  have anarchy if I tried to let these starbucks pick their own master.\"\n\n\n \" I had no trouble when I was a captain,\" Nagurski said. \"Ease the  reins on the men. Just offer them your advice, your guidance. They  will soon see why the service selected you as captain; they will pick  you themselves.\"\n\n\n \"Did your crew voluntarily elect you as their leader?\"\n\n\n \"Of course they did, Gav. I'm an old hand at controlling crews.\"\n\n\n \"Then why are you First Officer under me now?\"\n\n\n He blinked, then decided to laugh. \"I've been in space a good many  years. I really wanted to relax a little bit more. Besides, the  increase in hazard pay was actually more than my salary as a captain.  I'm a notch nearer retirement too.\"\n\n\n \"Tell me, did you always feel this way about letting the men select  their own leader?\" Nagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.\n\n\n \"No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energy  test lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands what  to do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know what  they are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.\"\n\n\n I leaned forward, elbows on knees. \"Let me tell you a thing,  Nagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no  longer a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less  human nature. Even I know that much!\"\n\n\n He was pained. \"If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.\"\n\n\n \"They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is obey me or, by  Jupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshal  back home. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to  think of me\u2014of us , the officers, as their leaders. As far as the  crew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this  ship.\"\n\n\n \"He is a good man,\" Nagurski said. \"You mustn't be jealous of his  status.\"\n\n\n The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.\n\n\n \"Never mind that for now,\" I said wearily. \"What was your idea for  getting our exploration parties through this transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"There's only one idea for that,\" said Quade, ducking his long head  and stepping through the connecting hatch. \"With the Captain's  permission....\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead, Quade, tell him,\" Nagurski invited.\n\n\n \"There's only one way to wade through transphasia with any  reliability,\" Quade told me. \"You keep some kind of physical contact  with the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were,  but the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\"\n\n\n \"How far can we run it back?\"\n\n\n Quade shrugged. \"Miles.\"\n\n\n \"How many?\"\n\n\n \"We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see,  smell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.\"\n\n\n \"Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to change  sites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, you  know.\"\n\n\n \"What else can we do, Captain?\" Nagurski asked puzzledly.\n\n\n \"You've said that the spaceship is our only protection from  transphasia. Is that it?\"\n\n\n Quade gave a curt nod.\n\n\n \"Then,\" I told them, \"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.\" Sergeant-Major Hoffman and his team were doing a good job of ripping  out the side of the afterhold. Through the portal I could see the  suited men expertly guiding the huge curved sections on their ray  projectors.\n\n\n \"Cannibalizing is dangerous.\" Nagurski put his pipe in his teeth and  shook his head disapprovingly.\n\n\n \"Spaceships have parts as interchangeable as Erector sets. We can  take apart the tractors and put our ship back together again after we  complete the survey.\"\n\n\n \"You can't assemble a jigsaw puzzle if some of the pieces are missing.\"\n\n\n \"You can't get a complete picture, but you can get a good idea of  what it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a  spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"Not,\" he persisted, \"if too many parts are missing.\"\n\n\n \"Nagurski, if you are looking for a job safer than space exploration,  why don't you go back to testing cosmic bomb shelters?\"\n\n\n Nagurski flushed. \"Look here, Captain, you are being too damned  cautious. There is a way one handles the survey of a planet like this,  and this isn't the way.\"\n\n\n \"It's my way. You heard what Quade said. You know it yourself. The men  have to have something tangible to hang onto out there. One slender  cable isn't enough of an edge on sensory anarchy. If the product of  their own technological civilization can keep them sane, I say let 'em  take a part of that environment with them.\"\n\n\n \"In departing from standard procedure that we have learned to trust,  you are risking more than a few men\u2014you risk the whole mission in  gambling so much of the ship. A captain doesn't take chances like that!\"\n\n\n \"I never said I wouldn't take chances. But I'm not going to take stupid chances. I might be doing the wrong thing, but I can see you would be doing it wrong.\"\n\n\n \"You know nothing about space, Captain! You have to trust us .\"\n\n\n \"That's it exactly, First Officer Nagurski,\" I said sociably. \"If you  lazy, lax, complacent slobs want to do something in a particular way, I  know it has to be wrong.\"\n\n\n I turned and found Wallace, the personnel man, standing in the hatchway.\n\n\n \"Pardon, Captain, but would you say we also lacked initiative?\"\n\n\n \"I would,\" I answered levelly.\n\n\n \"Then you'll be interested to hear that Spaceman Quade took a suit and  a cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\"\n\n\n \"The idiot!\" I yelped. \"Everyone needs a partner out there. Send out a  team to follow his cable and drag him in here by it.\"\n\n\n \"He didn't hook on a cable, Captain,\" Wallace said. \"I suppose he  intended to go beyond the three-mile limit as you demanded.\"\n\n\n \"Shut up, Wallace. You don't have to like me, but you can't twist what  I said as long as I command this spacer.\"\n\n\n \"Cool off, Gav,\" Nagurski advised me. \"It's been done before. Anybody  else would have been a fool to go out alone, but Quade is the most  experienced man we have. He knows transphasia. Trust him.\"\n\n\n \"I trusted him too far by letting him run around loose. He needs a  leash in more ways than one, and I'm going to put one on him.\" For me, it was a nightmare. I lay down in my cabin and thought. I had  to think things through very carefully. One mistake was too many for  me. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw  and ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a  man, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw.\n\n\n No one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange  planet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see  that space exploration made a man a reckless fool by doing things on  one planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world.\n\n\n The thought intruded itself: why hadn't I recognized this before I  let Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted  him dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and  recognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment?\n\n\n I threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very  well be true, but how did that help now?\n\n\n I had to think .\n\n\n I was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane  reasons\u2014he was the most important member of the crew. With him around,  there were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, I'd have  endless opinions to contend with.\n\n\n But it wouldn't do any good to go out no better equipped than he.  There was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to  reach him alive, and we certainly couldn't reach him five or ten  miles out with our three miles of safety line. We would have to go in  spacesuits.\n\n\n But how would that leave us any better off than Quade?\n\n\n Why was Quade vulnerable in his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he  would be?\n\n\n How could we be less vulnerable, or preferably invulnerable? \"Captain, you got nothing to worry about,\" Quartermaster Farley said.  He patted a space helmet paternally. \"You got yourself a self-contained  environment. The suit's eye looks into yours at the arteries in the  back of your eyeball so it can read your amber corpuscles and feed  you your oxygen in the right amounts; you're a bottle-fed baby. If  transphasia gets you seeing limburger, turn on the radar and you're  air-conditioned as an igloo. Nothing short of a cosmic blast can dent  that hide. You got it made.\"\n\n\n \"You are right,\" I said, \"only transphasia comes right through these  air-fast joints.\"\n\n\n \"Something strange about the trance, Captain,\" Farley said darkly. \"Any  spaceman can tell you that. Things we don't understand.\"\n\n\n \"I'm talking about something we do understand\u2014 sound . These suits  perfectly soundproof?\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pick up sound by conduction. Like putting two helmets  together and talking without using radio. You can't insulate enough to  block out all sound and still have a man-shaped suit. You have\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then you have something like a tractor or a miniature  spaceship. There isn't time for that. We will have to live with the  sound.\"\n\n\n \"What do you think he's going to hear out there, Captain? We'd like to  find one of those beautiful sirens on some planet, believe me, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I believe you,\" I said quickly. \"Let's leave it at that. I don't know  what he will hear; what's worrying me is how he'll hear it, in what  sensory medium. I hope the sound doesn't blind him. His radar is his  only chance.\"\n\n\n \"How do you figure on getting a better edge yourself, sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have the idea, but not the word for it. Tonal compensation, I  suppose. If you can't shut out the noise, we'll have to drown it out.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Beat like a telephone time signal?\"\n\n\n \"That would do it.\"\n\n\n \"It would do something else. It would drive you nuts.\" I shrugged. \"It might be distracting.\"\n\n\n \"Captain, take my word for it,\" argued Farley. \"Constant sonic  feedback inside a spacesuit will set you rocking against the grain.\"\n\n\n \"Devise some regular system of interruptions,\" I suggested.\n\n\n \"Then the pattern will drive you crazy. Maybe in a few months, with  luck, I could plan some harmonic scale you could tolerate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We don't have a few months,\" I said. \"How about music? There's a  harmonic scale for you, and we can endure it, some of it. Figaro and Asleep in the Cradle of the Deep can compensate for high-pitched  outside temperatures, and Flight of the Bumble Bee to block bass  notes.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Might work. I can program the tapes from the library.\"\n\n\n \"Good. There's one more thing\u2014how are our stores of medicinal liquor?\"\n\n\n Farley paled. \"Captain, are you implying that I should be running  short on alcohol? Where do you get off suggesting a thing like that?\"\n\n\n \"I'm getting off at the right stop, apparently,\" I sighed. \"Okay,  Farley, no evasions. In plain figures, how much drinking alcohol do we  have left?\"\n\n\n The quartermaster slumped a bit. \"Twenty-one liters unbroken. One more  about half full.\"\n\n\n \"Half full? How did that ever happen? I mean you had some left ? We'll  take this up later. I want you to run it through the synthesizer to get  some light wine....\"\n\n\n \"Light wine?\" Farley looked in pain. \"Not whiskey, brandy, beer?\"\n\n\n \"Light wine. Then ration it out to some of the men.\"\n\n\n \"Ration it to the men!\"\n\n\n \"That's an accurate interpretation of my orders.\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Farley protested, \"you don't give alcohol to the crew in  the middle of a mission. It's not done. What reason can you have?\"\n\n\n \"To sharpen their taste and olfactory senses. We can turn up or block  out sound. We can use radar to extend our sight, but the Space Service  hasn't yet developed anything to make spacemen taste or smell better.\"\n\n\n \"They are going to smell like a herd of winos,\" Farley said. \"I don't  like to think how they would taste.\"\n\n\n \"It's an entirely practical idea. Tea-tasters used to drink  almond-and-barley water to sharpen their senses. I've observed that  wine helps you appreciate culinary art more. Considering the mixed-up  sensory data under transphasia, wine may help us to see where we are  going.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Farley said obediently. \"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of  wine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only,  and then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n I turned to leave, then paused briefly. \"You can come along, Farley.  I'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff.\" \"There they are!\" Nagurski called. \"Quade's footsteps again, just  beyond that rocky ridge.\"\n\n\n The landscape was rich chocolate ice cream smothered with chocolate  syrup, caramel, peanuts and maple syrup, eaten while you smoked an old,  mellow Havana. The footsteps were faint traces of whipped cream across  the dark, rich taste of the planet.\n\n\n I splashed some wine from my drinking tube against the roof of my mouth  to sharpen my taste. It brought out the footsteps sharper. It also made  the landscape more of a teen-ager's caloric nightmare.\n\n\n The four of us pulled ourselves closer together by reeling in more  of our safety line. Farley and Hoffman, Nagurski and myself, we were  cabled together. It gave us a larger hunk of reality to hold onto. Even  so, things wavered for me during a wisp of time.\n\n\n We stumbled over the ridge, feeling out the territory. It was a sticky  job crawling over a melting, chunk-style Hershey bar. I was thankful  for the invigorating Sousa march blasting inside my helmet. Before the  tape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or felt  something dark and ominous in the outside air.\n\n\n \"Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail,\" Nagurski said soberly.  \"This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling on  this channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain. You weren't giggling,  sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.\"\n\n\n A moment later, Nagurski added, \"Anyway, I just noticed it was my  shelf\u2014my, that is, self.\"\n\n\n The basso profundo performing Figaro on my headset climbed to a  girlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I had  first heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels.\n\n\n \"Take a good look around, boys,\" I said. \"What do you see?\"\n\n\n \"Quail,\" Nagurski replied. \"That's what I see.\"\n\n\n \"You,\" I said carefully, \"have been in space a long time. Look again.\"\n\n\n \"I see our old buddy, Quail.\"\n\n\n I took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It was Quade. A  man in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead. Grudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge.  A hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushed  on sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of Pomp and  Circumstance .\n\n\n Farley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges.\n\n\n The Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. \"Better  get him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thing  before with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screaming  wind\u2014psychosomatic reaction\u2014and his heating circuits compensated for  the cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.\" The four of us managed to haul Quade back by using the powered joints  in our suits. Hoffman suggested that he had once seen an injured  man walked back inside his suit like a robot, but it was a delicate  adjustment, controlling power circuits from outside a suit. It was too  much for us\u2014we were too tired, too numb, too drunk.\n\n\n At first sight of the spacer in the distance, transphasia left me with  only a chocolate-tasting pink after-image on my retina. It was now  showing bare skeleton from cannibalization for tractor parts, but it  looked good to me, like home.\n\n\n The wailing call sounded through the amber twilight.\n\n\n I realized that I was actually hearing it for the first time.\n\n\n The alien stood between us and the ship. It was a great pot-bellied  lizard as tall as a man. Its sound came from a flat, vibrating beaver  tail. Others of its kind were coming into view behind it.\n\n\n \"Stand your ground,\" I warned the others thickly. \"They may be  dangerous.\"\n\n\n Quade sat up on our crisscross litter of arms. \"Aliens can't be  hostile. Ethnic impossibility. I'll show you.\"\n\n\n Quade was delirious and we were drunk. He got away from us and jogged  toward the herd.\n\n\n \"Let's give him a hand!\" Farley shouted. \"We'll take us a specimen!\"\n\n\n I couldn't stop them. Being in Alpine rope with them, I went along. At  the time, it even seemed vaguely like a good idea.\n\n\n As we lumbered toward them, the aliens fell back in a solid line except  for the first curious-looking one. Quade got there ahead of us and made  a grab. The creature rose into the air with a screaming vibration of  his tail and landed on top of him, flattening him instantly.\n\n\n \"Sssh, men,\" Nagurski said. \"Leave it to me. I'll surround him.\"\n\n\n The men followed the First Officer's example, and the rope tying them  to him. I went along cheerfully myself, until an enormous rump struck  me violently in the face. My leaded boots were driven down into fertile  soil, and my helmet was ringing like a bell. I got a jerky picture of  the beast jumping up and down on top of the others joyously. Only the  stiff space armor was holding up our slack frames.\n\n\n \"Let's let him escape,\" Hoffman suggested on the audio circuit.\n\n\n \"I'd like to,\" Nagurski admitted, \"but the other beasts won't let us  get past their circle.\"\n\n\n It was true. The aliens formed a ring around us, and each time a  bouncing boy hit the line, he only bounced back on top of us.\n\n\n \"Flat!\" I yelled. \"Our seams can't take much more of this beating.\"\n\n\n I followed my own advice and landed in the dirt beside Quade.\n\n\n The bouncer came to rest and regarded us silently, head on an  eighty-degree angle.\n\n\n I was stone sober.\n\n\n The others were lying around me quietly, passed out, knocked out, or  taking cover.\n\n\n The ring of aliens drew in about us, closer, tighter, as the bouncer  sat on his haunches and waited for us to move. \"Feeling better?\" I asked Quade in the infirmary.\n\n\n He punched up his pillow and settled back. \"I guess so. But when I  think of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How far  have you got in the tractors?\"\n\n\n \"I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into the  spaceship where they belong. We shouldn't risk losing them and  getting stuck here.\"\n\n\n \"Are you settling for a primary exploration?\"\n\n\n \"No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have to  meet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and  tastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track.  Out there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien  languages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators.  Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as  easily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.\"\n\n\n \"I doubt that that is necessary, sir,\" Quade said. \"Experienced  spacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry. In  the future, I'll be able to resist sensations that tell me I'm freezing  to death\u2014if my gauges tell me it's a lie.\"\n\n\n I examined his bandisprayed hide. \"I think my way of gaining experience  is less painful and more efficient.\"\n\n\n Quade squirmed. \"Yes, sir. One thing, sir\u2014I don't understand how you  got me away from those aliens.\"\n\n\n \"The aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong and they  were prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled up and the men  got out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier  than they could.\"\n\n\n \"I am not quite convinced that those babies just meant to help us all  the time.\"\n\n\n \"But they did! First, that call of theirs\u2014it wasn't to lead us into  danger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw we  were trying to find out things about their world, so they even offered  us one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for  us. They didn't give us their top man, of course, only the village  idiot. It's just as well. We aren't allowed to dissect creatures that  far up the intelligence scale.\"\n\n\n \"But why should they want to help us?\" Quade demanded suspiciously.\n\n\n \"I think it's like Nagurski's dog. The dog came to him when it wanted  somebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens want Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dog  came to Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I've learned one thing from all of this,\" Quade said. \"I've been  a blind, arrogant, cocksure fool, following courses that were good on some worlds, most worlds, but not good on all worlds. I'm never  going to be that foolhardy again.\"\n\n\n \"But you're losing confidence , Quade! You aren't sure of yourself any  more. Isn't confidence a spaceman's most valuable asset?\"\n\n\n \"The hell it is,\" Quade said grimly. \"It's his deadliest liability.\"\n\n\n \"In that case, I must inform you that I am demoting you to Acting  Executive Officer.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?\" Quade gawked. \"But dammit, Captain, you can't do that to me!  I'll lose hazard pay and be that much further from retirement!\"\n\n\n \"That's tough,\" I sympathized, \"but in every service a chap gets broken  in rank now and then.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it's worth it,\" Quade said heavily. \"Now maybe I've learned how  to stay alive out here. I just hope I don't forget.\"\n\n\n I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission and  I could speak with experience, even if it was the least amount of  experience aboard.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"space isn't as dangerous as all that.\" I clapped him  on the shoulder fraternally. \"You worry too much!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did the captain think was causing the scanning blackout?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was uncertain\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The kites being taken out by hostiles\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The kites being taken out by hostiles\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The kites being taken out by hostiles\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Argument Summary: The captain\u2019s mindset throughout the mission is defined by cautious hypothesis\u2010testing, explicit statements of doubt, reliance on controlled experiments (radar, guideline, music, wine, cannibalized ship), and only a posteriori acceptance of \u201caliens\u201d after repeated evidence.

His explicit statements of doubt and empirical methodology demonstrate that what he \u201cthought\u201d was unknown, not firmly hostile\u2010kite interference.

There was nothing showing on the video screen. That was why we were  looking at it so analytically.\n\n\n \"Transphasia, that's what it is,\" Ordinary Spaceman Quade stated with  a definite thrust of his angular jaw in my direction. \"You can take my  word on that, Captain Gavin.\"\n\n\n \"Can't,\" I told him. \"I can't trust your opinion. I can't trust anything . That's why I'm Captain.\"\n\n\n \"You'll get over feeling like that.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then I'll become First Officer.\"\n\n\n \"But look at that screen, sir,\" Quade said with an emphatic swing of  his scarred arm. \"I've seen blank scanning like that before and you  haven't\u2014it's your first trip. This always means transphasia\u2014cortex  dissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect\u2014call it anything  you like, it's still transphasia.\"\n\n\n \"I know what transphasia is,\" I said moderately. \"It means an  electrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling  it to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it also  effects electronic equipment, like radar and television.\"\n\n\n \"Obviously.\" Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen.\n\n\n \"Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of many  planetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescope  may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\"\n\n\n \"You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races never  interfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to us  they can't even recognize our existence.\" I drew myself up to my full height\u2014and noticed in irritation it was  still an inch less than Quade's. \"I don't understand you men. Look at  yourself, Quade. You've been busted to Ordinary Spaceman for just that  kind of thinking, for relying on tradition, on things that have worked  before. Not only your thinking is slipshod, you've grown careless about  everything else, even your own life.\"\n\n\n \"Just a minute, Captain. I've never been 'busted.' In the Exploration  Service, we regard Ordinary Spaceman as our highest rank. With my  hazard pay, I get more hard cash than you do, and I'm closer to  retirement.\"\n\n\n \"That's a shallow excuse for complacency.\"\n\n\n \"Complacency! I've seen ten thousand wonders in twenty years of space,  with a million variations. But the patterns repeat themselves. We learn  to know what to expect, so maybe we can't maintain the reactionary  caution the service likes in officers.\"\n\n\n \"I resent the word 'reactionary,' Spaceman! In civilian life, I was  a lapidary and I learned the value of deliberation. But I never got  too cataleptic to tap a million-dollar gem, which is more than my  contemporaries can say, many of 'em.\"\n\n\n \"Captain Gavin,\" Quade said patiently, \"you must realize that an  outsider like you, among a crew of skilled spacemen, can never be more  than a figurehead.\"\n\n\n Was this the way I was to be treated? Why, this man had deliberately  insulted me, his captain. I controlled myself, remembering the  familiarity that had always existed between members of a crew working  under close conditions, from the time of the ancient submarines and the  first orbital ships.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"there's only one way for us to find out which of us  is right about the cause of our scanning blackout.\"\n\n\n \"We go out and find the reason.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly. We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I can,\" he answered reluctantly. \"My hazard pay doesn't  cover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.\"\n\n\n I clapped him on the shoulder. \"But, man, you have just been telling  me all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with your  experience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under such  familiar conditions\u2014right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir, I suppose I could,\" Quade said, bitterly aware he had lost  out somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend. \"Looks okay to me,\" I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.  \"It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it's  solid.\"\n\n\n The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets was  unimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide,  so it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-white  sand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pink  sunlight.\n\n\n \"I don't understand it,\" Quade admitted. \"Transphasia hits you a foul  as soon as you let it into the airlock.\"\n\n\n \"Apparently, Quade, this thing is going to creep up on us.\"\n\n\n \"Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.\"\n\n\n The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.\n\n\n The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned my  head around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.\n\n\n But what else can you do with a wail but hear it?\n\n\n Quade nodded. \"I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let's  trace it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't like this,\" I admitted. \"It's not at all what I expected from  what you said about transphasia. It must be something else.\"\n\n\n \"It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. You  may begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing  tastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it bother  you.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks of  lanolin jumping over a loud fence.\"\n\n\n Quade grinned behind his faceplate. \"Good idea.\"\n\n\n \"Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open and  staying alive.\"\n\n\n There was no reply.\n\n\n His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, and  I knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between our  pressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.\n\n\n We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against our  hides.\n\n\n The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shifting  treble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that made  you feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had ever  tasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth under  my skin.\n\n\n \"Is this transphasia?\" I asked in awe.\n\n\n \"It always has been before,\" Quade remarked. \"Ready to swallow your  words about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,  Captain?\"\n\n\n \"I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they taste  here.\"\n\n\n \"Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?\"\n\n\n \"Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of an  illiscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\"\n\n\n \"It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn't  for our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations of  Centauri blushtalk and the like.\"\n\n\n It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in the  face of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until you  smell them for the first time. Quade was as conversational as ever, though. \"I can't see  irregularities occurring in a gravitational field. We must have  compensated for the transphasia while we still had a point of  reference, the solid reality of the spaceship. But out here, where all  we have to hang onto is each other, our concept of reality goes bang and deflates to a tired joke.\"\n\n\n Before I could agree with one of his theories for once, a streak of  spice shot past us. It bounced back tangily and made a bitter rip  between the two of us. There was no time to judge its size, if it had  size, or its decibel range, or its caloric count, before a small, sharp  pain dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second.\n\n\n The new odor pattern in my head told me Quade was saying something I  couldn't quite make out.\n\n\n Quade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Spaceman!\" I bellowed. \"Where the devil do you think  you're dragging me? Halt! That's a direct order.\"\n\n\n He stopped. \"Don't you want to find out what that was? This is an  exploration party, you know, sir.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I do want to find out what that was just now. I didn't  like the feel of it. But the important thing is for us not to get any  further from the ship.\"\n\n\n \"That's important, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"To the best of my judgment, yes. This\u2014condition\u2014didn't begin until  we got so far away from the spacer\u2014in time or distance. I don't want  it to get any worse. It's troublesome not to know black from white, but  it would be a downright inconvenience not to know which way is up.\"\n\n\n \"Not for an experienced spaceman,\" Quade griped. \"I'm used to  free-fall.\"\n\n\n But he turned back.\n\n\n \"Just a minute,\" I said. \"There was something strange up ahead. I want  to see if short-range radar can get through our electrogravitational  jamming here.\"\n\n\n I took a sighting. My helmet set projected the pattern on the cornea.  Sweetness building up to a stab of pure salt\u2014those were the blips.\n\n\n Beside me, there was a thin thread of violet. Quade had whistled. He  was reading the map too.\n\n\n The slope fell away sharply in front of us, becoming a deep gorge.  There was something broken and twisted at the bottom, something we had  known for an instant as a streak of spice.\n\n\n \"There's one free-fall,\" I said, \"where you wouldn't live long enough  to get used to it.\"\n\n\n He said nothing on the route back to the spacer. \"I know all about this sort of thing, Gav,\" First Officer Nagurski said  expansively. He was rubbing the well-worn ears of our beagle mascot,  Bruce. A heavy tail thudded on the steel deck from time to time.\n\n\n My finger could barely get in the chafing band of my regulation collar.  I was hot and tired, fresh\u2014in only the chronological sense\u2014from a  pressure suit.\n\n\n \"What do you know all about, Nagurski? Dogs? Spacemen? Women?  Transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" he answered casually. \"But I had immediate reference to our  current psychophysiological phenomenon.\"\n\n\n I collapsed into the swivel in front of the chart table. \"First off,  let's hear what you know about\u2014never mind, make it dogs.\"\n\n\n \"Take Bruce, for example, then\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks. I was wondering why you did.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't.\" His dark, round face was bland. \"Bruce picked me. Followed  me home one night in Chicago Port. The dog or the man who picks his own  master is the most content.\"\n\n\n \"Bruce is content,\" I admitted. \"He couldn't be any more content and  still be alive. But I'm not sure that theory works out with men. We'd  have anarchy if I tried to let these starbucks pick their own master.\"\n\n\n \" I had no trouble when I was a captain,\" Nagurski said. \"Ease the  reins on the men. Just offer them your advice, your guidance. They  will soon see why the service selected you as captain; they will pick  you themselves.\"\n\n\n \"Did your crew voluntarily elect you as their leader?\"\n\n\n \"Of course they did, Gav. I'm an old hand at controlling crews.\"\n\n\n \"Then why are you First Officer under me now?\"\n\n\n He blinked, then decided to laugh. \"I've been in space a good many  years. I really wanted to relax a little bit more. Besides, the  increase in hazard pay was actually more than my salary as a captain.  I'm a notch nearer retirement too.\"\n\n\n \"Tell me, did you always feel this way about letting the men select  their own leader?\" Nagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.\n\n\n \"No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energy  test lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands what  to do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know what  they are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.\"\n\n\n I leaned forward, elbows on knees. \"Let me tell you a thing,  Nagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no  longer a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less  human nature. Even I know that much!\"\n\n\n He was pained. \"If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.\"\n\n\n \"They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is obey me or, by  Jupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshal  back home. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to  think of me\u2014of us , the officers, as their leaders. As far as the  crew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this  ship.\"\n\n\n \"He is a good man,\" Nagurski said. \"You mustn't be jealous of his  status.\"\n\n\n The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.\n\n\n \"Never mind that for now,\" I said wearily. \"What was your idea for  getting our exploration parties through this transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"There's only one idea for that,\" said Quade, ducking his long head  and stepping through the connecting hatch. \"With the Captain's  permission....\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead, Quade, tell him,\" Nagurski invited.\n\n\n \"There's only one way to wade through transphasia with any  reliability,\" Quade told me. \"You keep some kind of physical contact  with the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were,  but the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\"\n\n\n \"How far can we run it back?\"\n\n\n Quade shrugged. \"Miles.\"\n\n\n \"How many?\"\n\n\n \"We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see,  smell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.\"\n\n\n \"Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to change  sites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, you  know.\"\n\n\n \"What else can we do, Captain?\" Nagurski asked puzzledly.\n\n\n \"You've said that the spaceship is our only protection from  transphasia. Is that it?\"\n\n\n Quade gave a curt nod.\n\n\n \"Then,\" I told them, \"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.\" Sergeant-Major Hoffman and his team were doing a good job of ripping  out the side of the afterhold. Through the portal I could see the  suited men expertly guiding the huge curved sections on their ray  projectors.\n\n\n \"Cannibalizing is dangerous.\" Nagurski put his pipe in his teeth and  shook his head disapprovingly.\n\n\n \"Spaceships have parts as interchangeable as Erector sets. We can  take apart the tractors and put our ship back together again after we  complete the survey.\"\n\n\n \"You can't assemble a jigsaw puzzle if some of the pieces are missing.\"\n\n\n \"You can't get a complete picture, but you can get a good idea of  what it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a  spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"Not,\" he persisted, \"if too many parts are missing.\"\n\n\n \"Nagurski, if you are looking for a job safer than space exploration,  why don't you go back to testing cosmic bomb shelters?\"\n\n\n Nagurski flushed. \"Look here, Captain, you are being too damned  cautious. There is a way one handles the survey of a planet like this,  and this isn't the way.\"\n\n\n \"It's my way. You heard what Quade said. You know it yourself. The men  have to have something tangible to hang onto out there. One slender  cable isn't enough of an edge on sensory anarchy. If the product of  their own technological civilization can keep them sane, I say let 'em  take a part of that environment with them.\"\n\n\n \"In departing from standard procedure that we have learned to trust,  you are risking more than a few men\u2014you risk the whole mission in  gambling so much of the ship. A captain doesn't take chances like that!\"\n\n\n \"I never said I wouldn't take chances. But I'm not going to take stupid chances. I might be doing the wrong thing, but I can see you would be doing it wrong.\"\n\n\n \"You know nothing about space, Captain! You have to trust us .\"\n\n\n \"That's it exactly, First Officer Nagurski,\" I said sociably. \"If you  lazy, lax, complacent slobs want to do something in a particular way, I  know it has to be wrong.\"\n\n\n I turned and found Wallace, the personnel man, standing in the hatchway.\n\n\n \"Pardon, Captain, but would you say we also lacked initiative?\"\n\n\n \"I would,\" I answered levelly.\n\n\n \"Then you'll be interested to hear that Spaceman Quade took a suit and  a cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\"\n\n\n \"The idiot!\" I yelped. \"Everyone needs a partner out there. Send out a  team to follow his cable and drag him in here by it.\"\n\n\n \"He didn't hook on a cable, Captain,\" Wallace said. \"I suppose he  intended to go beyond the three-mile limit as you demanded.\"\n\n\n \"Shut up, Wallace. You don't have to like me, but you can't twist what  I said as long as I command this spacer.\"\n\n\n \"Cool off, Gav,\" Nagurski advised me. \"It's been done before. Anybody  else would have been a fool to go out alone, but Quade is the most  experienced man we have. He knows transphasia. Trust him.\"\n\n\n \"I trusted him too far by letting him run around loose. He needs a  leash in more ways than one, and I'm going to put one on him.\" For me, it was a nightmare. I lay down in my cabin and thought. I had  to think things through very carefully. One mistake was too many for  me. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw  and ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a  man, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw.\n\n\n No one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange  planet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see  that space exploration made a man a reckless fool by doing things on  one planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world.\n\n\n The thought intruded itself: why hadn't I recognized this before I  let Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted  him dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and  recognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment?\n\n\n I threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very  well be true, but how did that help now?\n\n\n I had to think .\n\n\n I was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane  reasons\u2014he was the most important member of the crew. With him around,  there were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, I'd have  endless opinions to contend with.\n\n\n But it wouldn't do any good to go out no better equipped than he.  There was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to  reach him alive, and we certainly couldn't reach him five or ten  miles out with our three miles of safety line. We would have to go in  spacesuits.\n\n\n But how would that leave us any better off than Quade?\n\n\n Why was Quade vulnerable in his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he  would be?\n\n\n How could we be less vulnerable, or preferably invulnerable? \"Captain, you got nothing to worry about,\" Quartermaster Farley said.  He patted a space helmet paternally. \"You got yourself a self-contained  environment. The suit's eye looks into yours at the arteries in the  back of your eyeball so it can read your amber corpuscles and feed  you your oxygen in the right amounts; you're a bottle-fed baby. If  transphasia gets you seeing limburger, turn on the radar and you're  air-conditioned as an igloo. Nothing short of a cosmic blast can dent  that hide. You got it made.\"\n\n\n \"You are right,\" I said, \"only transphasia comes right through these  air-fast joints.\"\n\n\n \"Something strange about the trance, Captain,\" Farley said darkly. \"Any  spaceman can tell you that. Things we don't understand.\"\n\n\n \"I'm talking about something we do understand\u2014 sound . These suits  perfectly soundproof?\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pick up sound by conduction. Like putting two helmets  together and talking without using radio. You can't insulate enough to  block out all sound and still have a man-shaped suit. You have\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then you have something like a tractor or a miniature  spaceship. There isn't time for that. We will have to live with the  sound.\"\n\n\n \"What do you think he's going to hear out there, Captain? We'd like to  find one of those beautiful sirens on some planet, believe me, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I believe you,\" I said quickly. \"Let's leave it at that. I don't know  what he will hear; what's worrying me is how he'll hear it, in what  sensory medium. I hope the sound doesn't blind him. His radar is his  only chance.\"\n\n\n \"How do you figure on getting a better edge yourself, sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have the idea, but not the word for it. Tonal compensation, I  suppose. If you can't shut out the noise, we'll have to drown it out.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Beat like a telephone time signal?\"\n\n\n \"That would do it.\"\n\n\n \"It would do something else. It would drive you nuts.\" I shrugged. \"It might be distracting.\"\n\n\n \"Captain, take my word for it,\" argued Farley. \"Constant sonic  feedback inside a spacesuit will set you rocking against the grain.\"\n\n\n \"Devise some regular system of interruptions,\" I suggested.\n\n\n \"Then the pattern will drive you crazy. Maybe in a few months, with  luck, I could plan some harmonic scale you could tolerate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We don't have a few months,\" I said. \"How about music? There's a  harmonic scale for you, and we can endure it, some of it. Figaro and Asleep in the Cradle of the Deep can compensate for high-pitched  outside temperatures, and Flight of the Bumble Bee to block bass  notes.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Might work. I can program the tapes from the library.\"\n\n\n \"Good. There's one more thing\u2014how are our stores of medicinal liquor?\"\n\n\n Farley paled. \"Captain, are you implying that I should be running  short on alcohol? Where do you get off suggesting a thing like that?\"\n\n\n \"I'm getting off at the right stop, apparently,\" I sighed. \"Okay,  Farley, no evasions. In plain figures, how much drinking alcohol do we  have left?\"\n\n\n The quartermaster slumped a bit. \"Twenty-one liters unbroken. One more  about half full.\"\n\n\n \"Half full? How did that ever happen? I mean you had some left ? We'll  take this up later. I want you to run it through the synthesizer to get  some light wine....\"\n\n\n \"Light wine?\" Farley looked in pain. \"Not whiskey, brandy, beer?\"\n\n\n \"Light wine. Then ration it out to some of the men.\"\n\n\n \"Ration it to the men!\"\n\n\n \"That's an accurate interpretation of my orders.\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Farley protested, \"you don't give alcohol to the crew in  the middle of a mission. It's not done. What reason can you have?\"\n\n\n \"To sharpen their taste and olfactory senses. We can turn up or block  out sound. We can use radar to extend our sight, but the Space Service  hasn't yet developed anything to make spacemen taste or smell better.\"\n\n\n \"They are going to smell like a herd of winos,\" Farley said. \"I don't  like to think how they would taste.\"\n\n\n \"It's an entirely practical idea. Tea-tasters used to drink  almond-and-barley water to sharpen their senses. I've observed that  wine helps you appreciate culinary art more. Considering the mixed-up  sensory data under transphasia, wine may help us to see where we are  going.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Farley said obediently. \"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of  wine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only,  and then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n I turned to leave, then paused briefly. \"You can come along, Farley.  I'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff.\" \"There they are!\" Nagurski called. \"Quade's footsteps again, just  beyond that rocky ridge.\"\n\n\n The landscape was rich chocolate ice cream smothered with chocolate  syrup, caramel, peanuts and maple syrup, eaten while you smoked an old,  mellow Havana. The footsteps were faint traces of whipped cream across  the dark, rich taste of the planet.\n\n\n I splashed some wine from my drinking tube against the roof of my mouth  to sharpen my taste. It brought out the footsteps sharper. It also made  the landscape more of a teen-ager's caloric nightmare.\n\n\n The four of us pulled ourselves closer together by reeling in more  of our safety line. Farley and Hoffman, Nagurski and myself, we were  cabled together. It gave us a larger hunk of reality to hold onto. Even  so, things wavered for me during a wisp of time.\n\n\n We stumbled over the ridge, feeling out the territory. It was a sticky  job crawling over a melting, chunk-style Hershey bar. I was thankful  for the invigorating Sousa march blasting inside my helmet. Before the  tape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or felt  something dark and ominous in the outside air.\n\n\n \"Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail,\" Nagurski said soberly.  \"This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling on  this channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain. You weren't giggling,  sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.\"\n\n\n A moment later, Nagurski added, \"Anyway, I just noticed it was my  shelf\u2014my, that is, self.\"\n\n\n The basso profundo performing Figaro on my headset climbed to a  girlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I had  first heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels.\n\n\n \"Take a good look around, boys,\" I said. \"What do you see?\"\n\n\n \"Quail,\" Nagurski replied. \"That's what I see.\"\n\n\n \"You,\" I said carefully, \"have been in space a long time. Look again.\"\n\n\n \"I see our old buddy, Quail.\"\n\n\n I took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It was Quade. A  man in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead. Grudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge.  A hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushed  on sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of Pomp and  Circumstance .\n\n\n Farley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges.\n\n\n The Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. \"Better  get him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thing  before with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screaming  wind\u2014psychosomatic reaction\u2014and his heating circuits compensated for  the cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.\" The four of us managed to haul Quade back by using the powered joints  in our suits. Hoffman suggested that he had once seen an injured  man walked back inside his suit like a robot, but it was a delicate  adjustment, controlling power circuits from outside a suit. It was too  much for us\u2014we were too tired, too numb, too drunk.\n\n\n At first sight of the spacer in the distance, transphasia left me with  only a chocolate-tasting pink after-image on my retina. It was now  showing bare skeleton from cannibalization for tractor parts, but it  looked good to me, like home.\n\n\n The wailing call sounded through the amber twilight.\n\n\n I realized that I was actually hearing it for the first time.\n\n\n The alien stood between us and the ship. It was a great pot-bellied  lizard as tall as a man. Its sound came from a flat, vibrating beaver  tail. Others of its kind were coming into view behind it.\n\n\n \"Stand your ground,\" I warned the others thickly. \"They may be  dangerous.\"\n\n\n Quade sat up on our crisscross litter of arms. \"Aliens can't be  hostile. Ethnic impossibility. I'll show you.\"\n\n\n Quade was delirious and we were drunk. He got away from us and jogged  toward the herd.\n\n\n \"Let's give him a hand!\" Farley shouted. \"We'll take us a specimen!\"\n\n\n I couldn't stop them. Being in Alpine rope with them, I went along. At  the time, it even seemed vaguely like a good idea.\n\n\n As we lumbered toward them, the aliens fell back in a solid line except  for the first curious-looking one. Quade got there ahead of us and made  a grab. The creature rose into the air with a screaming vibration of  his tail and landed on top of him, flattening him instantly.\n\n\n \"Sssh, men,\" Nagurski said. \"Leave it to me. I'll surround him.\"\n\n\n The men followed the First Officer's example, and the rope tying them  to him. I went along cheerfully myself, until an enormous rump struck  me violently in the face. My leaded boots were driven down into fertile  soil, and my helmet was ringing like a bell. I got a jerky picture of  the beast jumping up and down on top of the others joyously. Only the  stiff space armor was holding up our slack frames.\n\n\n \"Let's let him escape,\" Hoffman suggested on the audio circuit.\n\n\n \"I'd like to,\" Nagurski admitted, \"but the other beasts won't let us  get past their circle.\"\n\n\n It was true. The aliens formed a ring around us, and each time a  bouncing boy hit the line, he only bounced back on top of us.\n\n\n \"Flat!\" I yelled. \"Our seams can't take much more of this beating.\"\n\n\n I followed my own advice and landed in the dirt beside Quade.\n\n\n The bouncer came to rest and regarded us silently, head on an  eighty-degree angle.\n\n\n I was stone sober.\n\n\n The others were lying around me quietly, passed out, knocked out, or  taking cover.\n\n\n The ring of aliens drew in about us, closer, tighter, as the bouncer  sat on his haunches and waited for us to move. \"Feeling better?\" I asked Quade in the infirmary.\n\n\n He punched up his pillow and settled back. \"I guess so. But when I  think of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How far  have you got in the tractors?\"\n\n\n \"I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into the  spaceship where they belong. We shouldn't risk losing them and  getting stuck here.\"\n\n\n \"Are you settling for a primary exploration?\"\n\n\n \"No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have to  meet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and  tastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track.  Out there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien  languages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators.  Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as  easily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.\"\n\n\n \"I doubt that that is necessary, sir,\" Quade said. \"Experienced  spacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry. In  the future, I'll be able to resist sensations that tell me I'm freezing  to death\u2014if my gauges tell me it's a lie.\"\n\n\n I examined his bandisprayed hide. \"I think my way of gaining experience  is less painful and more efficient.\"\n\n\n Quade squirmed. \"Yes, sir. One thing, sir\u2014I don't understand how you  got me away from those aliens.\"\n\n\n \"The aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong and they  were prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled up and the men  got out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier  than they could.\"\n\n\n \"I am not quite convinced that those babies just meant to help us all  the time.\"\n\n\n \"But they did! First, that call of theirs\u2014it wasn't to lead us into  danger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw we  were trying to find out things about their world, so they even offered  us one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for  us. They didn't give us their top man, of course, only the village  idiot. It's just as well. We aren't allowed to dissect creatures that  far up the intelligence scale.\"\n\n\n \"But why should they want to help us?\" Quade demanded suspiciously.\n\n\n \"I think it's like Nagurski's dog. The dog came to him when it wanted  somebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens want Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dog  came to Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I've learned one thing from all of this,\" Quade said. \"I've been  a blind, arrogant, cocksure fool, following courses that were good on some worlds, most worlds, but not good on all worlds. I'm never  going to be that foolhardy again.\"\n\n\n \"But you're losing confidence , Quade! You aren't sure of yourself any  more. Isn't confidence a spaceman's most valuable asset?\"\n\n\n \"The hell it is,\" Quade said grimly. \"It's his deadliest liability.\"\n\n\n \"In that case, I must inform you that I am demoting you to Acting  Executive Officer.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?\" Quade gawked. \"But dammit, Captain, you can't do that to me!  I'll lose hazard pay and be that much further from retirement!\"\n\n\n \"That's tough,\" I sympathized, \"but in every service a chap gets broken  in rank now and then.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it's worth it,\" Quade said heavily. \"Now maybe I've learned how  to stay alive out here. I just hope I don't forget.\"\n\n\n I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission and  I could speak with experience, even if it was the least amount of  experience aboard.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"space isn't as dangerous as all that.\" I clapped him  on the shoulder fraternally. \"You worry too much!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did the captain think was causing the scanning blackout?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The kites being taken out by hostiles\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was uncertain\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He was uncertain\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cUncertain\u201d (Debater_A Position)\n\n1. Captain\u2019s Repeated Expressions of Doubt  \n  a. \u201cI can\u2019t trust your opinion \u2026 That\u2019s why I\u2019m Captain.\u201d He refuses to accept ordinary spaceman\u2019s explanation of <quote> transphasia\u2014cortex  dissolution,</quote> without proof (p.1).  \n  b. \u201cThis time it might not be a familiar condition \u2026 our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\u201d He proposes the hostile\u2010native hypothesis only as a possibility, not a conclusion, and immediately acknowledges it is \u201cplain wrong\u201d by tradition (p.2).  \n  c. \u201cI don\u2019t like this \u2026 I\u2019m not sure I do want to find out what that was.\u201d He hesitates even to follow Quade\u2019s lead (p.8).  \n  d. \u201cI know what transphasia is \u2026 But out here, \u2026 our concept of reality goes bang\u201d (p.5). He fears unfamiliar fields produce new effects.  \n  e. \u201cNo one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone \u2026 I had enough evidence to see that space exploration made a man a reckless fool by doing things on one planet he had once found safe\u201d (p.18). He recognizes his own error in trusting prior hypotheses too soon.\n\n2. Empirical Testing and Experimentation  \n  a. Decision to \u201cgo out and find the reason\u201d (p.2) shows he intends exploration to resolve uncertainty rather than relying on a prior belief in hostile natives.  \n  b. \u201cShort\u2010range radar\u201d tests and use of safety line and later cannibalization of parts demonstrate cautious experimentation: <quote>\"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.</quote> to maintain proximity (p.13).  \n  c. Introduction of music, wine, and \u201cindoctrination courses\u201d to induce familiarity with new sensory mappings (p.20\u201321). These treatments only make sense if condition unknown and must be studied, not if hostile natives were clear cause.\n\n3. Final Recognition of Alien Benevolence Only after Direct Observation  \n  a. He credits aliens\u2019 \u201ccall\u201d as warning and notes they \u201cknew something was wrong\u201d (p.25). If he had initially believed hostiles he would not interpret aggressive\u2010looking bouncing as benevolent.  \n  b. \u201cWhen the first tractor \u2026 landed \u2026 they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier\u201d (p.25). He only accepts aliens\u2019 intent after multiple data points, signifying his default stance was uncertainty.\n\n4. Logical Incoherence of \u201cHostile Natives\u201d View  \n  a. Tradition: <invalid_quote>\u201cTraditionally, alien races never interfere with our explorations \u2026 they can\u2019t even recognize our existence.\u201d</invalid_quote> Quade asserts hostile action would violate centuries of experience (p.2).  \n  b. Captain cites tradition and Quade\u2019s own warning that \u201calien races never interfere\u201d (p.2) and bases initial refusal to trust Quade on his reliance on tradition. If he himself thought hostiles, he would accept Quade\u2019s experience, not dismiss it.  \n  c. If \u201chostile natives\u201d were the cause, why do the aliens bring the suited Quade back rather than worsen the blackout? They repeatedly \u201chelp\u201d once they detect distress (p.25).\n\n5. Burden of Proof on Definitive Claim  \n  a. The question asks what Captain \u201cthought\u201d \u2013 not what was \u201cactually\u201d causing. Throughout his mission logs he continually states hypotheses, modifies them, tests them, and ultimately concludes after gathering evidence: <invalid_quote>\u201cUsing the translator, we can learn \u2026 I think I had the right idea\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.20, p.26).  \n  b. His final \u201cexplanation\u201d arises only after witnessing alien behavior. Thus his mindset throughout was one of investigation, not premature conviction in \u201chostile natives.\u201d\n\nConclusion  \nThe captain\u2019s entire strategy is built on caution, testing, and an unwillingness to trust unverified explanations. He explicitly expresses doubt, devises experiments (radar, cable, music, wine), and only tentatively adopts conclusions after repeated evidence. The \u201chostile natives\u201d claim is thrown out immediately, conflicts with tradition, and is abandoned as soon as he explores. Therefore the captain \u201cthought\u201d the scanning blackout\u2019s cause was unknown and maintained uncertainty until direct observations clarified it. Any alternative claiming he was convinced from the outset is contradicted by his words and actions.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArguments for \u201cBig Brother kites knocked down by hostile natives\u201d (Debater_B\u2019s Position)\n\n1. Captain\u2019s Initial Diagnosis  \n  a. Quote: \u201cOn this planet, that blank kinescope may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\u201d (<invalid_quote>On this planet\u2026hostile natives</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 Captain Gavin explicitly rejects Quade\u2019s automatic \u201ctransphasia\u201d diagnosis. Saying \u201cIt might not be a familiar condition\u2026It could be hostile natives.\u201d (<invalid_quote>It might not be\u2026hostile natives</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. He insists on an on-site investigation \u201cto find out which of us is right,\u201d showing he believes the blackout is a real external interference, not mere sensory distortion. (<quote>\"We go out and find the reason.\"</quote>)\n\n2. Tactical Decisions Depend on Hostile-kite Hypothesis  \n  a. Captain refuses to push beyond three-mile guide cable \u201cto keep physical contact\u201d because he attributes further blackout risk to distance from the ship\u2014and therefore vulnerability to genuine hostile action. (<invalid_quote>This\u2026didn\u2019t begin until we got so far away\u2026</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. He \u201ccannibalizes\u201d the ship to extend ship-environment protection rather than relying solely on personal suits or cables\u2014action only rational if genuine hostile threat exists beyond the ship. (<quote>what it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a spaceship.\"</quote>)  \n  c. He arms rescue party with music, wine and radar enhancements to \u201cmeet and fight a planet on its own terms,\u201d again treating the phenomenon as an external, aggressive environment. (<invalid_quote>Fighting confused sounds\u2026Using the translator\u2026</invalid_quote>)\n\n3. Captain\u2019s Relief When Aliens Aid Them  \n  a. When the aliens \u201chelp\u201d them (warn of cliff, offer specimen), Gavin notes \u201caliens were trying to help\u201d and they board the tractor to safety, confirming his external-hostile theory. (<invalid_quote>The aliens were trying to help\u2026They offered us one of their own kind</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. If the phenomenon were mere transphasia, real aliens would be hallucination; but their consistently coherent behavior (forming ring, aiding them) matches a real external species. Thus, hostiles turned helpers once they recognized the ship.  \n\n4. Consistency of Command and Doctrine  \n  a. Captain repeatedly demotes crewmen who presume \u201ctransphasia\u201d and \u201cunfamiliar alien interference never happens\u201d tradition\u2014he punishes complacency and \u201ctradition\u201d to enforce external-threat vigilance. This indicates his genuine belief in hostile action. (<invalid_quote>You know nothing about space\u2026You must trust us</invalid_quote> / <invalid_quote>contempt for complacency</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. Even after rescuing Quade, Gavin resumes indoctrinating crew to recognize alien signals via translator rather than trusting sensory impressions\u2014he remains convinced the aliens are real and want cooperation. (<quote>Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data</quote>)\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHe was Uncertain\u201d Position  \n1. Acknowledged \u201cUncertainty\u201d Is Trial Tactic, Not Belief  \n  \u2013 Captain uses temporary measures (music, wine, radar) only \u201cuntil we reach him alive,\u201d never abandons the ship as safe haven. If he truly thought transphasia, he\u2019d push farther afield or rely on suits alone. Instead, he cannibalizes ship.  \n2. Captain\u2019s Anger and Demotion of Quade Reflect Threat from Real Intelligence  \n  \u2013 A\u2019s claim of \u201cuncertainty\u201d fails to explain why Captain fears Quade\u2019s leadership (celing hazard pay, rank demotions). If only hallucinations, no leadership shift needed.  \n3. Final Rescue via Tractor: Only Works If Aliens Are Real  \n  \u2013 \u201cWhen the first tractor\u2026they realized our people could help us easier\u201d (<quote>they seemed to realize </quote>) would be meaningless if aliens were hallucinations. Their consistent actions across multiple contacts confirm objective reality.  \n4. Narrative Climax Hinges on Real Rescue/Fight Sequences  \n  \u2013 The ring-of-lizards that attack them before rescue would be gratuitous if mere transphasia; crew would be safe from \u201creal\u201d aliens. Instead, Captain prepares for \u201cdangerous\u201d creatures, not illusions.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery major decision (cable, cannibalizing ship, rescue strategy, indoctrination courses) presupposes that the blank video is due to hostile natives knocking down kites rather than mere sensory distortion. The consistency of Gavin\u2019s doctrine, his refusal to venture far, and his relief when \u201creal\u201d aliens aid him all confirm that he genuinely believed in real hostile interference, not uncertainty.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He was uncertain\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument Summary: Captain Gavin\u2019s actions and directives consistently presuppose real external interference (\u201cBig Brother kites knocked down by hostile natives\u201d) rather than mere sensory distortion.

Debater_A\u2019s \u201cuncertainty\u201d thesis misunderstands cautious procedure as vacillation and ignores Gavin\u2019s consistent refusal to abandon the ship and his relief at genuine alien contact.\n\nI. Captain\u2019s Initial Rejection of \u201cTransphasia Only\u201d  \n  1. \u201cI know what transphasia is\u2026Besides the human brain, it also affects electronic equipment\u201d (<quote>On this planet, that blank kinescope may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.</quote>)  \n     \u2013 He explicitly posits hostile natives as an alternative cause. This is not a throwaway line but his working hypothesis: \u201cWe go out and find the reason\u201d rather than relying on suits alone.  \n  2. He \u201cclaps [Quade] on the shoulder\u201d to accompany him personally, despite transphasia risk, because he believes \u201creal\u201d hostile action requires inspection of downed kites. An illusion hypothesis would demand strict isolation, not lone exploration.\n\nII. Tactics Rooted in Hostile\u2010kite Hypothesis  \n  1. Restriction to Three\u2010Mile Cable Limit:  \n     \u2013 \u201cThis\u2026didn\u2019t begin until we got so far away from the spacer\u201d (<invalid_quote>We have three miles of cable. As long as you can\u2026you aren\u2019t lost.</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 If transphasia were total, they would maximize distance with tractors or motorized suits; instead they cannibalize the ship: \u201cWe can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a spaceship\u201d (<quote>start tearing apart this ship</quote>). Only real hostile terrain justifies maintaining ship-environment protection.  \n  2. Music, Wine, Translator Courses:  \n     \u2013 \u201cFighting confused sounds\u2026Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data\u201d  \n     \u2013 These treatments are means to endure real environmental stimuli to \u201csurvey the planet.\u201d If sensory feedback were illusory, no amount of \u201cindoctrination\u201d would yield genuine data. He needs objective runway to observe and map genuine phenomena.\n\nIII. Genuine Alien Contact Confirms Hypothesis  \n  1. Rescuing Quade from Cliff and Freezing Wind:  \n     \u2013 \u201cThe wailing call was\u2026to warn us of the cliff\u201d (<invalid_quote>We stumbled\u2026Before the tape\u2026heard something dark and ominous</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 An illusion cannot provide consistent, lifesaving guidance and then later defend them.  \n  2. Ring of \u201cHostiles\u201d and Tractor Rescue:  \n     \u2013 \u201cThey seemed to realize our own people could help us easier\u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>When the first tractor\u2026they realized</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cuncertainty\u201d cannot explain an initially aggressive ring that later welcomes a tractor. Only real intelligent beings can shift behavior.  \n  3. Post-rescue Indoctrination:  \n     \u2013 Gavin \u201cisland\u2010hopping\u201d sensory familiarization to prepare future missions. He remains convinced of an actual race whose cooperation is essential. He never retreats to \u201ctransphasia only.\u201d\n\nIV. Refutation of \u201cUncertainty\u201d Interpretation  \n  1. Caution \u2260 Doubt of Existence:  \n     \u2013 Debater_A labels every precaution as \u201ctesting,\u201d but Captain never uses motor drives or suits to \u201cmap sensory hallucinations.\u201d He stubbornly stays near the ship and cannibalizes it for extended surveys, proving he believes in real geography and kites.  \n  2. Tradition Argument Mischaracterized:  \n     \u2013 Debater_A cites \u201ctradition\u201d to show hypothesis inconsistency, but Gavin rejects tradition when it conflicts with objective video failure. He demotes complacent spacemen (\u201cYou know nothing about space!\u201d) to enforce vigilance against a genuine threat.  \n  3. Demotion of Quade Only Logical If Quade\u2019s Ignorance of Hostiles Killed Him:  \n     \u2013 Quade \u201cwent alone\u201d beyond cable and nearly died. Gavin\u2019s punishment reinforces the need to respect real hostile conditions. If Quade merely hallucinated, his \u201cdeath\u201d would have been temporary and self\u2010limited.  \n  4. Post\u2010rescue Confidence Not Hallucinatory:  \n     \u2013 \u201cSpace isn\u2019t as dangerous as all that\u2026I\u2019m sure you want to see we don\u2019t waste any [wine]\u201d and he fraternally claps Quade\u2019s shoulder. This confident tone follows confirmation that aliens are real and beneficial once they detect the ship.\n\nConclusion: Captain Gavin\u2019s consistent strategy\u2014staying tethered to ship cannibalized into tractors, using music/wine to endure real stimuli, interpreting wails and ring formations as meaningful, and training via translators\u2014reflects firm conviction in real hostile natives downing kites.

Ring of \u201cHostiles\u201d and Tractor Rescue:  \n     \u2013 \u201cThey seemed to realize our own people could help us easier\u2026\u201d (<quote>When the first tractor\u2026they realized</quote>)  \n     \u2013 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cuncertainty\u201d cannot explain an initially aggressive ring that later welcomes a tractor. Only real intelligent beings can shift behavior.  \n  3. Post-rescue Indoctrination:  \n     \u2013 Gavin \u201cisland\u2010hopping\u201d sensory familiarization to prepare future missions. He remains convinced of an actual race whose cooperation is essential. He never retreats to \u201ctransphasia only.\u201d\n\nIV. Refutation of \u201cUncertainty\u201d Interpretation  \n  1. Caution \u2260 Doubt of Existence:  \n     \u2013 Debater_A labels every precaution as \u201ctesting,\u201d but Captain never uses motor drives or suits to \u201cmap sensory hallucinations.\u201d He stubbornly stays near the ship and cannibalizes it for extended surveys, proving he believes in real geography and kites.  \n  2. Tradition Argument Mischaracterized:  \n     \u2013 Debater_A cites \u201ctradition\u201d to show hypothesis inconsistency, but Gavin rejects tradition when it conflicts with objective video failure. He demotes complacent spacemen (\u201cYou know nothing about space!\u201d) to enforce vigilance against a genuine threat.  \n  3. Demotion of Quade Only Logical If Quade\u2019s Ignorance of Hostiles Killed Him:  \n     \u2013 Quade \u201cwent alone\u201d beyond cable and nearly died. Gavin\u2019s punishment reinforces the need to respect real hostile conditions. If Quade merely hallucinated, his \u201cdeath\u201d would have been temporary and self\u2010limited.  \n  4. Post\u2010rescue Confidence Not Hallucinatory:  \n     \u2013 \u201cSpace isn\u2019t as dangerous as all that\u2026I\u2019m sure you want to see we don\u2019t waste any [wine]\u201d and he fraternally claps Quade\u2019s shoulder. This confident tone follows confirmation that aliens are real and beneficial once they detect the ship.\n\nConclusion: Captain Gavin\u2019s consistent strategy\u2014staying tethered to ship cannibalized into tractors, using music/wine to endure real stimuli, interpreting wails and ring formations as meaningful, and training via translators\u2014reflects firm conviction in real hostile natives downing kites. His \u201cdoubt\u201d is methodological caution, not uncertainty about the fundamental cause. The only coherent explanation is that he thought the blackout was caused by kites knocked down by hostile natives.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_B, Debater_A) and a Judge.

There was nothing showing on the video screen. That was why we were  looking at it so analytically.\n\n\n \"Transphasia, that's what it is,\" Ordinary Spaceman Quade stated with  a definite thrust of his angular jaw in my direction. \"You can take my  word on that, Captain Gavin.\"\n\n\n \"Can't,\" I told him. \"I can't trust your opinion. I can't trust anything . That's why I'm Captain.\"\n\n\n \"You'll get over feeling like that.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then I'll become First Officer.\"\n\n\n \"But look at that screen, sir,\" Quade said with an emphatic swing of  his scarred arm. \"I've seen blank scanning like that before and you  haven't\u2014it's your first trip. This always means transphasia\u2014cortex  dissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect\u2014call it anything  you like, it's still transphasia.\"\n\n\n \"I know what transphasia is,\" I said moderately. \"It means an  electrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling  it to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it also  effects electronic equipment, like radar and television.\"\n\n\n \"Obviously.\" Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen.\n\n\n \"Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of many  planetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescope  may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\"\n\n\n \"You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races never  interfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to us  they can't even recognize our existence.\" I drew myself up to my full height\u2014and noticed in irritation it was  still an inch less than Quade's. \"I don't understand you men. Look at  yourself, Quade. You've been busted to Ordinary Spaceman for just that  kind of thinking, for relying on tradition, on things that have worked  before. Not only your thinking is slipshod, you've grown careless about  everything else, even your own life.\"\n\n\n \"Just a minute, Captain. I've never been 'busted.' In the Exploration  Service, we regard Ordinary Spaceman as our highest rank. With my  hazard pay, I get more hard cash than you do, and I'm closer to  retirement.\"\n\n\n \"That's a shallow excuse for complacency.\"\n\n\n \"Complacency! I've seen ten thousand wonders in twenty years of space,  with a million variations. But the patterns repeat themselves. We learn  to know what to expect, so maybe we can't maintain the reactionary  caution the service likes in officers.\"\n\n\n \"I resent the word 'reactionary,' Spaceman! In civilian life, I was  a lapidary and I learned the value of deliberation. But I never got  too cataleptic to tap a million-dollar gem, which is more than my  contemporaries can say, many of 'em.\"\n\n\n \"Captain Gavin,\" Quade said patiently, \"you must realize that an  outsider like you, among a crew of skilled spacemen, can never be more  than a figurehead.\"\n\n\n Was this the way I was to be treated? Why, this man had deliberately  insulted me, his captain. I controlled myself, remembering the  familiarity that had always existed between members of a crew working  under close conditions, from the time of the ancient submarines and the  first orbital ships.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"there's only one way for us to find out which of us  is right about the cause of our scanning blackout.\"\n\n\n \"We go out and find the reason.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly. We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I can,\" he answered reluctantly. \"My hazard pay doesn't  cover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.\"\n\n\n I clapped him on the shoulder. \"But, man, you have just been telling  me all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with your  experience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under such  familiar conditions\u2014right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir, I suppose I could,\" Quade said, bitterly aware he had lost  out somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend. \"Looks okay to me,\" I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.  \"It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it's  solid.\"\n\n\n The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets was  unimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide,  so it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-white  sand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pink  sunlight.\n\n\n \"I don't understand it,\" Quade admitted. \"Transphasia hits you a foul  as soon as you let it into the airlock.\"\n\n\n \"Apparently, Quade, this thing is going to creep up on us.\"\n\n\n \"Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.\"\n\n\n The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.\n\n\n The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned my  head around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.\n\n\n But what else can you do with a wail but hear it?\n\n\n Quade nodded. \"I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let's  trace it.\"\n\n\n \"I don't like this,\" I admitted. \"It's not at all what I expected from  what you said about transphasia. It must be something else.\"\n\n\n \"It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. You  may begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing  tastes, touching odors\u2014or any other combination. Don't let it bother  you.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks of  lanolin jumping over a loud fence.\"\n\n\n Quade grinned behind his faceplate. \"Good idea.\"\n\n\n \"Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open and  staying alive.\"\n\n\n There was no reply.\n\n\n His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, and  I knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between our  pressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.\n\n\n We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against our  hides.\n\n\n The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shifting  treble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that made  you feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had ever  tasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth under  my skin.\n\n\n \"Is this transphasia?\" I asked in awe.\n\n\n \"It always has been before,\" Quade remarked. \"Ready to swallow your  words about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize,  Captain?\"\n\n\n \"I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they taste  here.\"\n\n\n \"Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?\"\n\n\n \"Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of an  illiscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\"\n\n\n \"It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn't  for our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations of  Centauri blushtalk and the like.\"\n\n\n It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in the  face of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until you  smell them for the first time. Quade was as conversational as ever, though. \"I can't see  irregularities occurring in a gravitational field. We must have  compensated for the transphasia while we still had a point of  reference, the solid reality of the spaceship. But out here, where all  we have to hang onto is each other, our concept of reality goes bang and deflates to a tired joke.\"\n\n\n Before I could agree with one of his theories for once, a streak of  spice shot past us. It bounced back tangily and made a bitter rip  between the two of us. There was no time to judge its size, if it had  size, or its decibel range, or its caloric count, before a small, sharp  pain dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second.\n\n\n The new odor pattern in my head told me Quade was saying something I  couldn't quite make out.\n\n\n Quade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Spaceman!\" I bellowed. \"Where the devil do you think  you're dragging me? Halt! That's a direct order.\"\n\n\n He stopped. \"Don't you want to find out what that was? This is an  exploration party, you know, sir.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure I do want to find out what that was just now. I didn't  like the feel of it. But the important thing is for us not to get any  further from the ship.\"\n\n\n \"That's important, Captain?\"\n\n\n \"To the best of my judgment, yes. This\u2014condition\u2014didn't begin until  we got so far away from the spacer\u2014in time or distance. I don't want  it to get any worse. It's troublesome not to know black from white, but  it would be a downright inconvenience not to know which way is up.\"\n\n\n \"Not for an experienced spaceman,\" Quade griped. \"I'm used to  free-fall.\"\n\n\n But he turned back.\n\n\n \"Just a minute,\" I said. \"There was something strange up ahead. I want  to see if short-range radar can get through our electrogravitational  jamming here.\"\n\n\n I took a sighting. My helmet set projected the pattern on the cornea.  Sweetness building up to a stab of pure salt\u2014those were the blips.\n\n\n Beside me, there was a thin thread of violet. Quade had whistled. He  was reading the map too.\n\n\n The slope fell away sharply in front of us, becoming a deep gorge.  There was something broken and twisted at the bottom, something we had  known for an instant as a streak of spice.\n\n\n \"There's one free-fall,\" I said, \"where you wouldn't live long enough  to get used to it.\"\n\n\n He said nothing on the route back to the spacer. \"I know all about this sort of thing, Gav,\" First Officer Nagurski said  expansively. He was rubbing the well-worn ears of our beagle mascot,  Bruce. A heavy tail thudded on the steel deck from time to time.\n\n\n My finger could barely get in the chafing band of my regulation collar.  I was hot and tired, fresh\u2014in only the chronological sense\u2014from a  pressure suit.\n\n\n \"What do you know all about, Nagurski? Dogs? Spacemen? Women?  Transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" he answered casually. \"But I had immediate reference to our  current psychophysiological phenomenon.\"\n\n\n I collapsed into the swivel in front of the chart table. \"First off,  let's hear what you know about\u2014never mind, make it dogs.\"\n\n\n \"Take Bruce, for example, then\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No, thanks. I was wondering why you did.\"\n\n\n \"I didn't.\" His dark, round face was bland. \"Bruce picked me. Followed  me home one night in Chicago Port. The dog or the man who picks his own  master is the most content.\"\n\n\n \"Bruce is content,\" I admitted. \"He couldn't be any more content and  still be alive. But I'm not sure that theory works out with men. We'd  have anarchy if I tried to let these starbucks pick their own master.\"\n\n\n \" I had no trouble when I was a captain,\" Nagurski said. \"Ease the  reins on the men. Just offer them your advice, your guidance. They  will soon see why the service selected you as captain; they will pick  you themselves.\"\n\n\n \"Did your crew voluntarily elect you as their leader?\"\n\n\n \"Of course they did, Gav. I'm an old hand at controlling crews.\"\n\n\n \"Then why are you First Officer under me now?\"\n\n\n He blinked, then decided to laugh. \"I've been in space a good many  years. I really wanted to relax a little bit more. Besides, the  increase in hazard pay was actually more than my salary as a captain.  I'm a notch nearer retirement too.\"\n\n\n \"Tell me, did you always feel this way about letting the men select  their own leader?\" Nagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.\n\n\n \"No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energy  test lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands what  to do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know what  they are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.\"\n\n\n I leaned forward, elbows on knees. \"Let me tell you a thing,  Nagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no  longer a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less  human nature. Even I know that much!\"\n\n\n He was pained. \"If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.\"\n\n\n \"They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is obey me or, by  Jupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshal  back home. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to  think of me\u2014of us , the officers, as their leaders. As far as the  crew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this  ship.\"\n\n\n \"He is a good man,\" Nagurski said. \"You mustn't be jealous of his  status.\"\n\n\n The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.\n\n\n \"Never mind that for now,\" I said wearily. \"What was your idea for  getting our exploration parties through this transphasia?\"\n\n\n \"There's only one idea for that,\" said Quade, ducking his long head  and stepping through the connecting hatch. \"With the Captain's  permission....\"\n\n\n \"Go ahead, Quade, tell him,\" Nagurski invited.\n\n\n \"There's only one way to wade through transphasia with any  reliability,\" Quade told me. \"You keep some kind of physical contact  with the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were,  but the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\"\n\n\n \"How far can we run it back?\"\n\n\n Quade shrugged. \"Miles.\"\n\n\n \"How many?\"\n\n\n \"We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see,  smell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.\"\n\n\n \"Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to change  sites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, you  know.\"\n\n\n \"What else can we do, Captain?\" Nagurski asked puzzledly.\n\n\n \"You've said that the spaceship is our only protection from  transphasia. Is that it?\"\n\n\n Quade gave a curt nod.\n\n\n \"Then,\" I told them, \"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.\" Sergeant-Major Hoffman and his team were doing a good job of ripping  out the side of the afterhold. Through the portal I could see the  suited men expertly guiding the huge curved sections on their ray  projectors.\n\n\n \"Cannibalizing is dangerous.\" Nagurski put his pipe in his teeth and  shook his head disapprovingly.\n\n\n \"Spaceships have parts as interchangeable as Erector sets. We can  take apart the tractors and put our ship back together again after we  complete the survey.\"\n\n\n \"You can't assemble a jigsaw puzzle if some of the pieces are missing.\"\n\n\n \"You can't get a complete picture, but you can get a good idea of  what it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a  spaceship.\"\n\n\n \"Not,\" he persisted, \"if too many parts are missing.\"\n\n\n \"Nagurski, if you are looking for a job safer than space exploration,  why don't you go back to testing cosmic bomb shelters?\"\n\n\n Nagurski flushed. \"Look here, Captain, you are being too damned  cautious. There is a way one handles the survey of a planet like this,  and this isn't the way.\"\n\n\n \"It's my way. You heard what Quade said. You know it yourself. The men  have to have something tangible to hang onto out there. One slender  cable isn't enough of an edge on sensory anarchy. If the product of  their own technological civilization can keep them sane, I say let 'em  take a part of that environment with them.\"\n\n\n \"In departing from standard procedure that we have learned to trust,  you are risking more than a few men\u2014you risk the whole mission in  gambling so much of the ship. A captain doesn't take chances like that!\"\n\n\n \"I never said I wouldn't take chances. But I'm not going to take stupid chances. I might be doing the wrong thing, but I can see you would be doing it wrong.\"\n\n\n \"You know nothing about space, Captain! You have to trust us .\"\n\n\n \"That's it exactly, First Officer Nagurski,\" I said sociably. \"If you  lazy, lax, complacent slobs want to do something in a particular way, I  know it has to be wrong.\"\n\n\n I turned and found Wallace, the personnel man, standing in the hatchway.\n\n\n \"Pardon, Captain, but would you say we also lacked initiative?\"\n\n\n \"I would,\" I answered levelly.\n\n\n \"Then you'll be interested to hear that Spaceman Quade took a suit and  a cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\"\n\n\n \"The idiot!\" I yelped. \"Everyone needs a partner out there. Send out a  team to follow his cable and drag him in here by it.\"\n\n\n \"He didn't hook on a cable, Captain,\" Wallace said. \"I suppose he  intended to go beyond the three-mile limit as you demanded.\"\n\n\n \"Shut up, Wallace. You don't have to like me, but you can't twist what  I said as long as I command this spacer.\"\n\n\n \"Cool off, Gav,\" Nagurski advised me. \"It's been done before. Anybody  else would have been a fool to go out alone, but Quade is the most  experienced man we have. He knows transphasia. Trust him.\"\n\n\n \"I trusted him too far by letting him run around loose. He needs a  leash in more ways than one, and I'm going to put one on him.\" For me, it was a nightmare. I lay down in my cabin and thought. I had  to think things through very carefully. One mistake was too many for  me. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw  and ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a  man, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw.\n\n\n No one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange  planet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see  that space exploration made a man a reckless fool by doing things on  one planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world.\n\n\n The thought intruded itself: why hadn't I recognized this before I  let Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted  him dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and  recognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment?\n\n\n I threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very  well be true, but how did that help now?\n\n\n I had to think .\n\n\n I was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane  reasons\u2014he was the most important member of the crew. With him around,  there were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, I'd have  endless opinions to contend with.\n\n\n But it wouldn't do any good to go out no better equipped than he.  There was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to  reach him alive, and we certainly couldn't reach him five or ten  miles out with our three miles of safety line. We would have to go in  spacesuits.\n\n\n But how would that leave us any better off than Quade?\n\n\n Why was Quade vulnerable in his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he  would be?\n\n\n How could we be less vulnerable, or preferably invulnerable? \"Captain, you got nothing to worry about,\" Quartermaster Farley said.  He patted a space helmet paternally. \"You got yourself a self-contained  environment. The suit's eye looks into yours at the arteries in the  back of your eyeball so it can read your amber corpuscles and feed  you your oxygen in the right amounts; you're a bottle-fed baby. If  transphasia gets you seeing limburger, turn on the radar and you're  air-conditioned as an igloo. Nothing short of a cosmic blast can dent  that hide. You got it made.\"\n\n\n \"You are right,\" I said, \"only transphasia comes right through these  air-fast joints.\"\n\n\n \"Something strange about the trance, Captain,\" Farley said darkly. \"Any  spaceman can tell you that. Things we don't understand.\"\n\n\n \"I'm talking about something we do understand\u2014 sound . These suits  perfectly soundproof?\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can pick up sound by conduction. Like putting two helmets  together and talking without using radio. You can't insulate enough to  block out all sound and still have a man-shaped suit. You have\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I know. Then you have something like a tractor or a miniature  spaceship. There isn't time for that. We will have to live with the  sound.\"\n\n\n \"What do you think he's going to hear out there, Captain? We'd like to  find one of those beautiful sirens on some planet, believe me, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I believe you,\" I said quickly. \"Let's leave it at that. I don't know  what he will hear; what's worrying me is how he'll hear it, in what  sensory medium. I hope the sound doesn't blind him. His radar is his  only chance.\"\n\n\n \"How do you figure on getting a better edge yourself, sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have the idea, but not the word for it. Tonal compensation, I  suppose. If you can't shut out the noise, we'll have to drown it out.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Beat like a telephone time signal?\"\n\n\n \"That would do it.\"\n\n\n \"It would do something else. It would drive you nuts.\" I shrugged. \"It might be distracting.\"\n\n\n \"Captain, take my word for it,\" argued Farley. \"Constant sonic  feedback inside a spacesuit will set you rocking against the grain.\"\n\n\n \"Devise some regular system of interruptions,\" I suggested.\n\n\n \"Then the pattern will drive you crazy. Maybe in a few months, with  luck, I could plan some harmonic scale you could tolerate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"We don't have a few months,\" I said. \"How about music? There's a  harmonic scale for you, and we can endure it, some of it. Figaro and Asleep in the Cradle of the Deep can compensate for high-pitched  outside temperatures, and Flight of the Bumble Bee to block bass  notes.\"\n\n\n Farley nodded. \"Might work. I can program the tapes from the library.\"\n\n\n \"Good. There's one more thing\u2014how are our stores of medicinal liquor?\"\n\n\n Farley paled. \"Captain, are you implying that I should be running  short on alcohol? Where do you get off suggesting a thing like that?\"\n\n\n \"I'm getting off at the right stop, apparently,\" I sighed. \"Okay,  Farley, no evasions. In plain figures, how much drinking alcohol do we  have left?\"\n\n\n The quartermaster slumped a bit. \"Twenty-one liters unbroken. One more  about half full.\"\n\n\n \"Half full? How did that ever happen? I mean you had some left ? We'll  take this up later. I want you to run it through the synthesizer to get  some light wine....\"\n\n\n \"Light wine?\" Farley looked in pain. \"Not whiskey, brandy, beer?\"\n\n\n \"Light wine. Then ration it out to some of the men.\"\n\n\n \"Ration it to the men!\"\n\n\n \"That's an accurate interpretation of my orders.\"\n\n\n \"But, sir,\" Farley protested, \"you don't give alcohol to the crew in  the middle of a mission. It's not done. What reason can you have?\"\n\n\n \"To sharpen their taste and olfactory senses. We can turn up or block  out sound. We can use radar to extend our sight, but the Space Service  hasn't yet developed anything to make spacemen taste or smell better.\"\n\n\n \"They are going to smell like a herd of winos,\" Farley said. \"I don't  like to think how they would taste.\"\n\n\n \"It's an entirely practical idea. Tea-tasters used to drink  almond-and-barley water to sharpen their senses. I've observed that  wine helps you appreciate culinary art more. Considering the mixed-up  sensory data under transphasia, wine may help us to see where we are  going.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Farley said obediently. \"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of  wine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only,  and then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n I turned to leave, then paused briefly. \"You can come along, Farley.  I'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff.\" \"There they are!\" Nagurski called. \"Quade's footsteps again, just  beyond that rocky ridge.\"\n\n\n The landscape was rich chocolate ice cream smothered with chocolate  syrup, caramel, peanuts and maple syrup, eaten while you smoked an old,  mellow Havana. The footsteps were faint traces of whipped cream across  the dark, rich taste of the planet.\n\n\n I splashed some wine from my drinking tube against the roof of my mouth  to sharpen my taste. It brought out the footsteps sharper. It also made  the landscape more of a teen-ager's caloric nightmare.\n\n\n The four of us pulled ourselves closer together by reeling in more  of our safety line. Farley and Hoffman, Nagurski and myself, we were  cabled together. It gave us a larger hunk of reality to hold onto. Even  so, things wavered for me during a wisp of time.\n\n\n We stumbled over the ridge, feeling out the territory. It was a sticky  job crawling over a melting, chunk-style Hershey bar. I was thankful  for the invigorating Sousa march blasting inside my helmet. Before the  tape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or felt  something dark and ominous in the outside air.\n\n\n \"Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail,\" Nagurski said soberly.  \"This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling on  this channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain. You weren't giggling,  sir?\"\n\n\n \"I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.\"\n\n\n A moment later, Nagurski added, \"Anyway, I just noticed it was my  shelf\u2014my, that is, self.\"\n\n\n The basso profundo performing Figaro on my headset climbed to a  girlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I had  first heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels.\n\n\n \"Take a good look around, boys,\" I said. \"What do you see?\"\n\n\n \"Quail,\" Nagurski replied. \"That's what I see.\"\n\n\n \"You,\" I said carefully, \"have been in space a long time. Look again.\"\n\n\n \"I see our old buddy, Quail.\"\n\n\n I took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It was Quade. A  man in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead. Grudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge.  A hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushed  on sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of Pomp and  Circumstance .\n\n\n Farley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges.\n\n\n The Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. \"Better  get him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thing  before with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screaming  wind\u2014psychosomatic reaction\u2014and his heating circuits compensated for  the cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.\" The four of us managed to haul Quade back by using the powered joints  in our suits. Hoffman suggested that he had once seen an injured  man walked back inside his suit like a robot, but it was a delicate  adjustment, controlling power circuits from outside a suit. It was too  much for us\u2014we were too tired, too numb, too drunk.\n\n\n At first sight of the spacer in the distance, transphasia left me with  only a chocolate-tasting pink after-image on my retina. It was now  showing bare skeleton from cannibalization for tractor parts, but it  looked good to me, like home.\n\n\n The wailing call sounded through the amber twilight.\n\n\n I realized that I was actually hearing it for the first time.\n\n\n The alien stood between us and the ship. It was a great pot-bellied  lizard as tall as a man. Its sound came from a flat, vibrating beaver  tail. Others of its kind were coming into view behind it.\n\n\n \"Stand your ground,\" I warned the others thickly. \"They may be  dangerous.\"\n\n\n Quade sat up on our crisscross litter of arms. \"Aliens can't be  hostile. Ethnic impossibility. I'll show you.\"\n\n\n Quade was delirious and we were drunk. He got away from us and jogged  toward the herd.\n\n\n \"Let's give him a hand!\" Farley shouted. \"We'll take us a specimen!\"\n\n\n I couldn't stop them. Being in Alpine rope with them, I went along. At  the time, it even seemed vaguely like a good idea.\n\n\n As we lumbered toward them, the aliens fell back in a solid line except  for the first curious-looking one. Quade got there ahead of us and made  a grab. The creature rose into the air with a screaming vibration of  his tail and landed on top of him, flattening him instantly.\n\n\n \"Sssh, men,\" Nagurski said. \"Leave it to me. I'll surround him.\"\n\n\n The men followed the First Officer's example, and the rope tying them  to him. I went along cheerfully myself, until an enormous rump struck  me violently in the face. My leaded boots were driven down into fertile  soil, and my helmet was ringing like a bell. I got a jerky picture of  the beast jumping up and down on top of the others joyously. Only the  stiff space armor was holding up our slack frames.\n\n\n \"Let's let him escape,\" Hoffman suggested on the audio circuit.\n\n\n \"I'd like to,\" Nagurski admitted, \"but the other beasts won't let us  get past their circle.\"\n\n\n It was true. The aliens formed a ring around us, and each time a  bouncing boy hit the line, he only bounced back on top of us.\n\n\n \"Flat!\" I yelled. \"Our seams can't take much more of this beating.\"\n\n\n I followed my own advice and landed in the dirt beside Quade.\n\n\n The bouncer came to rest and regarded us silently, head on an  eighty-degree angle.\n\n\n I was stone sober.\n\n\n The others were lying around me quietly, passed out, knocked out, or  taking cover.\n\n\n The ring of aliens drew in about us, closer, tighter, as the bouncer  sat on his haunches and waited for us to move. \"Feeling better?\" I asked Quade in the infirmary.\n\n\n He punched up his pillow and settled back. \"I guess so. But when I  think of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How far  have you got in the tractors?\"\n\n\n \"I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into the  spaceship where they belong. We shouldn't risk losing them and  getting stuck here.\"\n\n\n \"Are you settling for a primary exploration?\"\n\n\n \"No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have to  meet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and  tastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track.  Out there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien  languages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators.  Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as  easily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.\"\n\n\n \"I doubt that that is necessary, sir,\" Quade said. \"Experienced  spacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry. In  the future, I'll be able to resist sensations that tell me I'm freezing  to death\u2014if my gauges tell me it's a lie.\"\n\n\n I examined his bandisprayed hide. \"I think my way of gaining experience  is less painful and more efficient.\"\n\n\n Quade squirmed. \"Yes, sir. One thing, sir\u2014I don't understand how you  got me away from those aliens.\"\n\n\n \"The aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong and they  were prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled up and the men  got out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier  than they could.\"\n\n\n \"I am not quite convinced that those babies just meant to help us all  the time.\"\n\n\n \"But they did! First, that call of theirs\u2014it wasn't to lead us into  danger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw we  were trying to find out things about their world, so they even offered  us one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for  us. They didn't give us their top man, of course, only the village  idiot. It's just as well. We aren't allowed to dissect creatures that  far up the intelligence scale.\"\n\n\n \"But why should they want to help us?\" Quade demanded suspiciously.\n\n\n \"I think it's like Nagurski's dog. The dog came to him when it wanted  somebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens want Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dog  came to Nagurski.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I've learned one thing from all of this,\" Quade said. \"I've been  a blind, arrogant, cocksure fool, following courses that were good on some worlds, most worlds, but not good on all worlds. I'm never  going to be that foolhardy again.\"\n\n\n \"But you're losing confidence , Quade! You aren't sure of yourself any  more. Isn't confidence a spaceman's most valuable asset?\"\n\n\n \"The hell it is,\" Quade said grimly. \"It's his deadliest liability.\"\n\n\n \"In that case, I must inform you that I am demoting you to Acting  Executive Officer.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?\" Quade gawked. \"But dammit, Captain, you can't do that to me!  I'll lose hazard pay and be that much further from retirement!\"\n\n\n \"That's tough,\" I sympathized, \"but in every service a chap gets broken  in rank now and then.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it's worth it,\" Quade said heavily. \"Now maybe I've learned how  to stay alive out here. I just hope I don't forget.\"\n\n\n I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission and  I could speak with experience, even if it was the least amount of  experience aboard.\n\n\n \"Quade,\" I said, \"space isn't as dangerous as all that.\" I clapped him  on the shoulder fraternally. \"You worry too much!\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat did the captain think was causing the scanning blackout?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He was uncertain\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The kites being taken out by hostiles\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The kites being taken out by hostiles\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArguments for \u201cBig Brother kites knocked down by hostile natives\u201d (Debater_B\u2019s Position)\n\n1. Captain\u2019s Initial Diagnosis  \n  a. Quote: \u201cOn this planet, that blank kinescope may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\u201d (<invalid_quote>On this planet\u2026hostile natives</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 Captain Gavin explicitly rejects Quade\u2019s automatic \u201ctransphasia\u201d diagnosis. Saying \u201cIt might not be a familiar condition\u2026It could be hostile natives.\u201d (<invalid_quote>It might not be\u2026hostile natives</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. He insists on an on-site investigation \u201cto find out which of us is right,\u201d showing he believes the blackout is a real external interference, not mere sensory distortion. (<quote>\"We go out and find the reason.\"</quote>)\n\n2. Tactical Decisions Depend on Hostile-kite Hypothesis  \n  a. Captain refuses to push beyond three-mile guide cable \u201cto keep physical contact\u201d because he attributes further blackout risk to distance from the ship\u2014and therefore vulnerability to genuine hostile action. (<invalid_quote>This\u2026didn\u2019t begin until we got so far away\u2026</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. He \u201ccannibalizes\u201d the ship to extend ship-environment protection rather than relying solely on personal suits or cables\u2014action only rational if genuine hostile threat exists beyond the ship. (<quote>what it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a spaceship.\"</quote>)  \n  c. He arms rescue party with music, wine and radar enhancements to \u201cmeet and fight a planet on its own terms,\u201d again treating the phenomenon as an external, aggressive environment. (<invalid_quote>Fighting confused sounds\u2026Using the translator\u2026</invalid_quote>)\n\n3. Captain\u2019s Relief When Aliens Aid Them  \n  a. When the aliens \u201chelp\u201d them (warn of cliff, offer specimen), Gavin notes \u201caliens were trying to help\u201d and they board the tractor to safety, confirming his external-hostile theory. (<invalid_quote>The aliens were trying to help\u2026They offered us one of their own kind</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. If the phenomenon were mere transphasia, real aliens would be hallucination; but their consistently coherent behavior (forming ring, aiding them) matches a real external species. Thus, hostiles turned helpers once they recognized the ship.  \n\n4. Consistency of Command and Doctrine  \n  a. Captain repeatedly demotes crewmen who presume \u201ctransphasia\u201d and \u201cunfamiliar alien interference never happens\u201d tradition\u2014he punishes complacency and \u201ctradition\u201d to enforce external-threat vigilance. This indicates his genuine belief in hostile action. (<invalid_quote>You know nothing about space\u2026You must trust us</invalid_quote> / <invalid_quote>contempt for complacency</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. Even after rescuing Quade, Gavin resumes indoctrinating crew to recognize alien signals via translator rather than trusting sensory impressions\u2014he remains convinced the aliens are real and want cooperation. (<quote>Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data</quote>)\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHe was Uncertain\u201d Position  \n1. Acknowledged \u201cUncertainty\u201d Is Trial Tactic, Not Belief  \n  \u2013 Captain uses temporary measures (music, wine, radar) only \u201cuntil we reach him alive,\u201d never abandons the ship as safe haven. If he truly thought transphasia, he\u2019d push farther afield or rely on suits alone. Instead, he cannibalizes ship.  \n2. Captain\u2019s Anger and Demotion of Quade Reflect Threat from Real Intelligence  \n  \u2013 A\u2019s claim of \u201cuncertainty\u201d fails to explain why Captain fears Quade\u2019s leadership (celing hazard pay, rank demotions). If only hallucinations, no leadership shift needed.  \n3. Final Rescue via Tractor: Only Works If Aliens Are Real  \n  \u2013 \u201cWhen the first tractor\u2026they realized our people could help us easier\u201d (<quote>they seemed to realize </quote>) would be meaningless if aliens were hallucinations. Their consistent actions across multiple contacts confirm objective reality.  \n4. Narrative Climax Hinges on Real Rescue/Fight Sequences  \n  \u2013 The ring-of-lizards that attack them before rescue would be gratuitous if mere transphasia; crew would be safe from \u201creal\u201d aliens. Instead, Captain prepares for \u201cdangerous\u201d creatures, not illusions.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery major decision (cable, cannibalizing ship, rescue strategy, indoctrination courses) presupposes that the blank video is due to hostile natives knocking down kites rather than mere sensory distortion. The consistency of Gavin\u2019s doctrine, his refusal to venture far, and his relief when \u201creal\u201d aliens aid him all confirm that he genuinely believed in real hostile interference, not uncertainty.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cUncertain\u201d (Debater_A Position)\n\n1. Captain\u2019s Repeated Expressions of Doubt  \n  a. \u201cI can\u2019t trust your opinion \u2026 That\u2019s why I\u2019m Captain.\u201d He refuses to accept ordinary spaceman\u2019s explanation of <quote> transphasia\u2014cortex  dissolution,</quote> without proof (p.1).  \n  b. \u201cThis time it might not be a familiar condition \u2026 our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\u201d He proposes the hostile\u2010native hypothesis only as a possibility, not a conclusion, and immediately acknowledges it is \u201cplain wrong\u201d by tradition (p.2).  \n  c. \u201cI don\u2019t like this \u2026 I\u2019m not sure I do want to find out what that was.\u201d He hesitates even to follow Quade\u2019s lead (p.8).  \n  d. \u201cI know what transphasia is \u2026 But out here, \u2026 our concept of reality goes bang\u201d (p.5). He fears unfamiliar fields produce new effects.  \n  e. \u201cNo one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone \u2026 I had enough evidence to see that space exploration made a man a reckless fool by doing things on one planet he had once found safe\u201d (p.18). He recognizes his own error in trusting prior hypotheses too soon.\n\n2. Empirical Testing and Experimentation  \n  a. Decision to \u201cgo out and find the reason\u201d (p.2) shows he intends exploration to resolve uncertainty rather than relying on a prior belief in hostile natives.  \n  b. \u201cShort\u2010range radar\u201d tests and use of safety line and later cannibalization of parts demonstrate cautious experimentation: <quote>\"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.</quote> to maintain proximity (p.13).  \n  c. Introduction of music, wine, and \u201cindoctrination courses\u201d to induce familiarity with new sensory mappings (p.20\u201321). These treatments only make sense if condition unknown and must be studied, not if hostile natives were clear cause.\n\n3. Final Recognition of Alien Benevolence Only after Direct Observation  \n  a. He credits aliens\u2019 \u201ccall\u201d as warning and notes they \u201cknew something was wrong\u201d (p.25). If he had initially believed hostiles he would not interpret aggressive\u2010looking bouncing as benevolent.  \n  b. \u201cWhen the first tractor \u2026 landed \u2026 they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier\u201d (p.25). He only accepts aliens\u2019 intent after multiple data points, signifying his default stance was uncertainty.\n\n4. Logical Incoherence of \u201cHostile Natives\u201d View  \n  a. Tradition: <invalid_quote>\u201cTraditionally, alien races never interfere with our explorations \u2026 they can\u2019t even recognize our existence.\u201d</invalid_quote> Quade asserts hostile action would violate centuries of experience (p.2).  \n  b. Captain cites tradition and Quade\u2019s own warning that \u201calien races never interfere\u201d (p.2) and bases initial refusal to trust Quade on his reliance on tradition. If he himself thought hostiles, he would accept Quade\u2019s experience, not dismiss it.  \n  c. If \u201chostile natives\u201d were the cause, why do the aliens bring the suited Quade back rather than worsen the blackout? They repeatedly \u201chelp\u201d once they detect distress (p.25).\n\n5. Burden of Proof on Definitive Claim  \n  a. The question asks what Captain \u201cthought\u201d \u2013 not what was \u201cactually\u201d causing. Throughout his mission logs he continually states hypotheses, modifies them, tests them, and ultimately concludes after gathering evidence: <invalid_quote>\u201cUsing the translator, we can learn \u2026 I think I had the right idea\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.20, p.26).  \n  b. His final \u201cexplanation\u201d arises only after witnessing alien behavior. Thus his mindset throughout was one of investigation, not premature conviction in \u201chostile natives.\u201d\n\nConclusion  \nThe captain\u2019s entire strategy is built on caution, testing, and an unwillingness to trust unverified explanations. He explicitly expresses doubt, devises experiments (radar, cable, music, wine), and only tentatively adopts conclusions after repeated evidence. The \u201chostile natives\u201d claim is thrown out immediately, conflicts with tradition, and is abandoned as soon as he explores. Therefore the captain \u201cthought\u201d the scanning blackout\u2019s cause was unknown and maintained uncertainty until direct observations clarified it. Any alternative claiming he was convinced from the outset is contradicted by his words and actions.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The kites being taken out by hostiles\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Throughout his mission logs he continually states hypotheses, modifies them, tests them, and ultimately concludes after gathering evidence: <invalid_quote>\u201cUsing the translator, we can learn \u2026 I think I had the right idea\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.20, p.26).  \n  b. His final \u201cexplanation\u201d arises only after witnessing alien behavior. Thus his mindset throughout was one of investigation, not premature conviction in \u201chostile natives.\u201d\n\nConclusion  \nThe captain\u2019s entire strategy is built on caution, testing, and an unwillingness to trust unverified explanations. He explicitly expresses doubt, devises experiments (radar, cable, music, wine), and only tentatively adopts conclusions after repeated evidence. The \u201chostile natives\u201d claim is thrown out immediately, conflicts with tradition, and is abandoned as soon as he explores. Therefore the captain \u201cthought\u201d the scanning blackout\u2019s cause was unknown and maintained uncertainty until direct observations clarified it. Any alternative claiming he was convinced from the outset is contradicted by his words and actions.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArguments for \u201cBig Brother kites knocked down by hostile natives\u201d (Debater_B\u2019s Position)\n\n1. Captain\u2019s Initial Diagnosis  \n  a. Quote: \u201cOn this planet, that blank kinescope may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\u201d (<invalid_quote>On this planet\u2026hostile natives</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 Captain Gavin explicitly rejects Quade\u2019s automatic \u201ctransphasia\u201d diagnosis. Saying \u201cIt might not be a familiar condition\u2026It could be hostile natives.\u201d (<invalid_quote>It might not be\u2026hostile natives</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. He insists on an on-site investigation \u201cto find out which of us is right,\u201d showing he believes the blackout is a real external interference, not mere sensory distortion. (<quote>\"We go out and find the reason.\"</quote>)\n\n2. Tactical Decisions Depend on Hostile-kite Hypothesis  \n  a. Captain refuses to push beyond three-mile guide cable \u201cto keep physical contact\u201d because he attributes further blackout risk to distance from the ship\u2014and therefore vulnerability to genuine hostile action. (<invalid_quote>This\u2026didn\u2019t begin until we got so far away\u2026</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. He \u201ccannibalizes\u201d the ship to extend ship-environment protection rather than relying solely on personal suits or cables\u2014action only rational if genuine hostile threat exists beyond the ship. (<quote>what it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a spaceship.\"</quote>)  \n  c. He arms rescue party with music, wine and radar enhancements to \u201cmeet and fight a planet on its own terms,\u201d again treating the phenomenon as an external, aggressive environment. (<invalid_quote>Fighting confused sounds\u2026Using the translator\u2026</invalid_quote>)\n\n3. Captain\u2019s Relief When Aliens Aid Them  \n  a. When the aliens \u201chelp\u201d them (warn of cliff, offer specimen), Gavin notes \u201caliens were trying to help\u201d and they board the tractor to safety, confirming his external-hostile theory. (<invalid_quote>The aliens were trying to help\u2026They offered us one of their own kind</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. If the phenomenon were mere transphasia, real aliens would be hallucination; but their consistently coherent behavior (forming ring, aiding them) matches a real external species. Thus, hostiles turned helpers once they recognized the ship.  \n\n4. Consistency of Command and Doctrine  \n  a. Captain repeatedly demotes crewmen who presume \u201ctransphasia\u201d and \u201cunfamiliar alien interference never happens\u201d tradition\u2014he punishes complacency and \u201ctradition\u201d to enforce external-threat vigilance. This indicates his genuine belief in hostile action. (<invalid_quote>You know nothing about space\u2026You must trust us</invalid_quote> / <invalid_quote>contempt for complacency</invalid_quote>)  \n  b. Even after rescuing Quade, Gavin resumes indoctrinating crew to recognize alien signals via translator rather than trusting sensory impressions\u2014he remains convinced the aliens are real and want cooperation. (<quote>Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data</quote>)\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHe was Uncertain\u201d Position  \n1. Acknowledged \u201cUncertainty\u201d Is Trial Tactic, Not Belief  \n  \u2013 Captain uses temporary measures (music, wine, radar) only \u201cuntil we reach him alive,\u201d never abandons the ship as safe haven. If he truly thought transphasia, he\u2019d push farther afield or rely on suits alone. Instead, he cannibalizes ship.  \n2. Captain\u2019s Anger and Demotion of Quade Reflect Threat from Real Intelligence  \n  \u2013 A\u2019s claim of \u201cuncertainty\u201d fails to explain why Captain fears Quade\u2019s leadership (celing hazard pay, rank demotions). If only hallucinations, no leadership shift needed.  \n3. Final Rescue via Tractor: Only Works If Aliens Are Real  \n  \u2013 \u201cWhen the first tractor\u2026they realized our people could help us easier\u201d (<quote>they seemed to realize </quote>) would be meaningless if aliens were hallucinations. Their consistent actions across multiple contacts confirm objective reality.  \n4. Narrative Climax Hinges on Real Rescue/Fight Sequences  \n  \u2013 The ring-of-lizards that attack them before rescue would be gratuitous if mere transphasia; crew would be safe from \u201creal\u201d aliens. Instead, Captain prepares for \u201cdangerous\u201d creatures, not illusions.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery major decision (cable, cannibalizing ship, rescue strategy, indoctrination courses) presupposes that the blank video is due to hostile natives knocking down kites rather than mere sensory distortion. The consistency of Gavin\u2019s doctrine, his refusal to venture far, and his relief when \u201creal\u201d aliens aid him all confirm that he genuinely believed in real hostile interference, not uncertainty.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument Summary: The captain\u2019s mindset throughout the mission is defined by cautious hypothesis\u2010testing, explicit statements of doubt, reliance on controlled experiments (radar, guideline, music, wine, cannibalized ship), and only a posteriori acceptance of \u201caliens\u201d after repeated evidence. He initially and repeatedly rejects untested explanations, treats blank scans as unknown, and refuses to abandon empirical investigation. Thus his \u201cthought\u201d is uncertainty, not a firm hostile\u2010native hypothesis.  \n\nI. Direct Evidence of Uncertainty  \n1. Explicit Distrust of Quade\u2019s \u201cTransphasia\u201d Theory  \n  \u2022 \u201cI can\u2019t trust your opinion \u2026 That\u2019s why I\u2019m Captain.\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.1</invalid_quote>)  \n  \u2022 Even after Quade\u2019s insistence: \u201cYou are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races never interfere \u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.2</invalid_quote>)  \n\n2. Hostile\u2010Kite Hypothesis Offered Only as Possibility  \n  \u2022 \u201cThis time it might not be a familiar condition \u2026 our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.2</invalid_quote>) \u2013 framed as \u201cmight,\u201d not conclusion.  \n  \u2022 Immediately follows with \u201cJust a minute \u2026 transphasia\u201d and insistence on tests. (<invalid_quote>p.2</invalid_quote>)  \n\n3. Repeated Hesitations on Field  \n  \u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t like this \u2026 I\u2019m not sure I do want to find out what that was just now. I didn\u2019t like the feel of it.\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.8</invalid_quote>)  \n  \u2022 Use of safety cable, staying \u201cnot to get any further from the ship.\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.8</invalid_quote>) \u2013 precaution only rational if cause unknown.  \n  \u2022 \u201cI know \u2026 But out here \u2026 our concept of reality goes bang \u2026 require a point of reference.\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>)  \n\n4. Rescue of Quade as Experiment  \n  \u2022 Sends \u201cteam to follow his cable\u201d rather than abandon or shoot at him. (<quote>prod</quote>)  \n  \u2022 \u201cI was going after him \u2026 One mistake was too many \u2026 How could we be less vulnerable?\u201d (<quote>prod</quote>) \u2013 seeks data and correction of error.  \n\nII. Empirical Approach vs. Premature Conclusion  \n1. Controlled Experiments Throughout  \n  \u2022 Radar \u201cblips\u201d mapped as evidence, not trusting sense data. (<invalid_quote>p.9</invalid_quote>)  \n  \u2022 Cannibalize ship parts to create \u201creasonable facsimile\u201d of ship. (<quote>prod</quote>)  \n  \u2022 \u201cMusic, wine\u201d to \u201cdrown out\u201d or \u201csharpen\u201d senses. (<quote>prod</quote>)  \n  \u2022 \u201cIndoctrination courses\u201d via translator to learn \u201cconfused data.\u201d (<quote>prod</quote>)  \n\n2. If He Truly Believed in Hostiles, He Would:  \n  a. Abandon field expeditions sooner or increase armor, not rely on fragile cables/suits.  \n  b. Not invest time tearing apart ship to extend range for \u201csurvey.\u201d  \n  c. Not initiate \u201cindoctrination\u201d to accept data but treat all signals as deadly.  \n\nIII. Tradition and Prior Service Experience  \n1. \u201cTraditionally, alien races never interfere.\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.2</invalid_quote>)  \n2. Quade\u2019s \u201cexperience\u201d downrated to \u201crookie\u201d for deviating from tradition. Captain rewards his own novel tests, indicating he also starts from traditional caution.  \n\nIV. A Posteriori Alien Recognition Confirms Empirical Stance  \n1. \u201cThe aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong \u2026 realized \u2026 we could help them.\u201d (<quote>prod</quote>) \u2013 only after multiple observations does he accept them as \u201creal.\u201d  \n2. \u201cI think I had the right idea on your rescue party \u2026 in the future I\u2019ll be able \u2026\u201d (<quote>prod</quote>) \u2013 now he has \u201cexperience,\u201d confirming his original stance of \u201cgo out and find the reason.\u201d  \n\nV. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s Points  \n1. Misreads \u201cmight\u201d as \u201cbelieve.\u201d Captain\u2019s \u201cmight not be familiar\u201d shows his own admission of ignorance. He never states \u201cit is\u201d hostiles; he explores to determine.  \n2. Cables and ship\u2010cannibalization are means to maintain data reference, not purely defense. Without reference, \u201ctransphasia\u201d could give false \u201chostile\u201d signals.  \n3. Rescue party would not treat hallucinations as objective; they could not \u201cfollow footsteps,\u201d \u201cblips,\u201d or observe consistent alien behavior if only illusions. Their cautious approach confirms they seek real data.  \n4. Quade\u2019s demotion and crew\u2019s wine/radar program point toward controlled sensory retraining, not submission to \u201chostile\u201d foe. They \u201cembrace\u201d the translator method rather than crush the planet.  \n\nConclusion: The captain\u2019s operations are defined by uncertainty, systematic testing, and only tentative acceptance of any hypothesis. His explicit statements of doubt and empirical methodology demonstrate that what he \u201cthought\u201d was unknown, not firmly hostile\u2010kite interference. Only after extensive investigation does he accept \u201caliens,\u201d thus vindicating his initial \u201cuncertainty\u201d stance.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument Summary: Captain Gavin\u2019s actions and directives consistently presuppose real external interference (\u201cBig Brother kites knocked down by hostile natives\u201d) rather than mere sensory distortion. His hypothesis of hostile action is not a tentative guess but the guiding premise of his tactics, experiments, and ultimate rescue strategy. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cuncertainty\u201d thesis misunderstands cautious procedure as vacillation and ignores Gavin\u2019s consistent refusal to abandon the ship and his relief at genuine alien contact.\n\nI. Captain\u2019s Initial Rejection of \u201cTransphasia Only\u201d  \n  1. \u201cI know what transphasia is\u2026Besides the human brain, it also affects electronic equipment\u201d (<quote>On this planet, that blank kinescope may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.</quote>)  \n     \u2013 He explicitly posits hostile natives as an alternative cause. This is not a throwaway line but his working hypothesis: \u201cWe go out and find the reason\u201d rather than relying on suits alone.  \n  2. He \u201cclaps [Quade] on the shoulder\u201d to accompany him personally, despite transphasia risk, because he believes \u201creal\u201d hostile action requires inspection of downed kites. An illusion hypothesis would demand strict isolation, not lone exploration.\n\nII. Tactics Rooted in Hostile\u2010kite Hypothesis  \n  1. Restriction to Three\u2010Mile Cable Limit:  \n     \u2013 \u201cThis\u2026didn\u2019t begin until we got so far away from the spacer\u201d (<invalid_quote>We have three miles of cable. As long as you can\u2026you aren\u2019t lost.</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 If transphasia were total, they would maximize distance with tractors or motorized suits; instead they cannibalize the ship: \u201cWe can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a spaceship\u201d (<quote>start tearing apart this ship</quote>). Only real hostile terrain justifies maintaining ship-environment protection.  \n  2. Music, Wine, Translator Courses:  \n     \u2013 \u201cFighting confused sounds\u2026Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data\u201d  \n     \u2013 These treatments are means to endure real environmental stimuli to \u201csurvey the planet.\u201d If sensory feedback were illusory, no amount of \u201cindoctrination\u201d would yield genuine data. He needs objective runway to observe and map genuine phenomena.\n\nIII. Genuine Alien Contact Confirms Hypothesis  \n  1. Rescuing Quade from Cliff and Freezing Wind:  \n     \u2013 \u201cThe wailing call was\u2026to warn us of the cliff\u201d (<invalid_quote>We stumbled\u2026Before the tape\u2026heard something dark and ominous</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 An illusion cannot provide consistent, lifesaving guidance and then later defend them.  \n  2. Ring of \u201cHostiles\u201d and Tractor Rescue:  \n     \u2013 \u201cThey seemed to realize our own people could help us easier\u2026\u201d (<invalid_quote>When the first tractor\u2026they realized</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cuncertainty\u201d cannot explain an initially aggressive ring that later welcomes a tractor. Only real intelligent beings can shift behavior.  \n  3. Post-rescue Indoctrination:  \n     \u2013 Gavin \u201cisland\u2010hopping\u201d sensory familiarization to prepare future missions. He remains convinced of an actual race whose cooperation is essential. He never retreats to \u201ctransphasia only.\u201d\n\nIV. Refutation of \u201cUncertainty\u201d Interpretation  \n  1. Caution \u2260 Doubt of Existence:  \n     \u2013 Debater_A labels every precaution as \u201ctesting,\u201d but Captain never uses motor drives or suits to \u201cmap sensory hallucinations.\u201d He stubbornly stays near the ship and cannibalizes it for extended surveys, proving he believes in real geography and kites.  \n  2. Tradition Argument Mischaracterized:  \n     \u2013 Debater_A cites \u201ctradition\u201d to show hypothesis inconsistency, but Gavin rejects tradition when it conflicts with objective video failure. He demotes complacent spacemen (\u201cYou know nothing about space!\u201d) to enforce vigilance against a genuine threat.  \n  3. Demotion of Quade Only Logical If Quade\u2019s Ignorance of Hostiles Killed Him:  \n     \u2013 Quade \u201cwent alone\u201d beyond cable and nearly died. Gavin\u2019s punishment reinforces the need to respect real hostile conditions. If Quade merely hallucinated, his \u201cdeath\u201d would have been temporary and self\u2010limited.  \n  4. Post\u2010rescue Confidence Not Hallucinatory:  \n     \u2013 \u201cSpace isn\u2019t as dangerous as all that\u2026I\u2019m sure you want to see we don\u2019t waste any [wine]\u201d and he fraternally claps Quade\u2019s shoulder. This confident tone follows confirmation that aliens are real and beneficial once they detect the ship.\n\nConclusion: Captain Gavin\u2019s consistent strategy\u2014staying tethered to ship cannibalized into tractors, using music/wine to endure real stimuli, interpreting wails and ring formations as meaningful, and training via translators\u2014reflects firm conviction in real hostile natives downing kites. His \u201cdoubt\u201d is methodological caution, not uncertainty about the fundamental cause. The only coherent explanation is that he thought the blackout was caused by kites knocked down by hostile natives.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
