HAGGERT\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Nothing in the world could be happier and   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but   what happens when it loves him back? Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve  has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero  and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.  Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the  appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't  know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've  sent him.\"\n\n\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would  betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant  and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not  large for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its  sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if  he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\n\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about  the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,  more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and  ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\n\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and  none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for  the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.  They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large  as they should have been for a plant this size.\n\n\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out  what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees  changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the  street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to  handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any  stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the  employees' entrance was on the third side.\n\n\n It wasn't. Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time  he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,  set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had  opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but  a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.  Manners?\"\n\n\n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\n\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a  microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down  the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open  for him.\n\n\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his  grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening  before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of  his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\n\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped  just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,  all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an  interview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to  unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\n\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,  straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying  for a position should.\n\n\n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\n\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in  front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.  He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\n\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with  a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and  massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed  paintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with  flowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor  into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\n\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted  for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of  frame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and  drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\n\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age  to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the  complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and  this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly. Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been  jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a  reply that would cost him this job.\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you  have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean  things like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the basics of how  we live.\"\n\n\n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions  they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them  out of you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After  I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with  an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The  company\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\n\n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\n \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.  \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them  with money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of  their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in  calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter  admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in  calculus.\"\n\n\n \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an  engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would  be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were  getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of  these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to  get a job with someone else?\"\n\n\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had  sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd  seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been  easy.\"\n\n\n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their  procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And  you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be  scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do  something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you  out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at  any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a  degree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\" It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play  this straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent  basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\n\n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has  been, yes.\"\n\n\n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?  So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a  highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this  stockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the  stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the  hell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have  to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the  solution?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.  What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left  school. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.  Right?\"\n\n\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and  whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\n\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,  Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!  \"No, you're not.\"\n\n\n \"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\n\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out  of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible  tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your  illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or  cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility  or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.  Those were the important things. The background data I got from the  Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.  I think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if  that answers the question.\"\n\n\n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\n\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows  at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,  the lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic  doors. Anything else?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\n\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but  they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar  products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or  water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the  goods.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show  you.\" The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the  antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to  the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly  disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high  overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance  of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool  of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they  reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck  loading door he had seen from outside.\n\n\n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving  with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set  of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door  exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these  materials handling machines.\"\n\n\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening  machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in  formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\n\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with  two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,  fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a  relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\n\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,  these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole  plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really  a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about  the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously  useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\n\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one  of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily  tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,  and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away  to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of  frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be  replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to  a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and  other materials were stored.\n\n\n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any  shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the  trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,  it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the  plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary  materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and  package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is  sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is  sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if  the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the  purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take  you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but  they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\" Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,  each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding  or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for  something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were  everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an  exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of  doing it.\n\n\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same  aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the  onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the  speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press  that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an  exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know  where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to  go by.\n\n\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small  room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In  that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the  typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the  keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In  this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall  there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic  bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"  asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that  had engulfed him.\n\n\n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in  every week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\n\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face  when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington  looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face  sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the  silence remain unbroken.\n\n\n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run  articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe  twenty years in the future.\"\n\n\n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.  \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\n\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.  Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,  although it hadn't been strenuous. He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely  in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's  arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this  business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got  through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and  got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.  They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,  determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too  absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical  theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I  tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for  one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only  way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\n\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he  spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,  because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.  After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I  suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for  a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My  wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,  was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that  made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't  made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time  to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I  remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the  girl.\n\n\n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many  employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd  design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up  myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it  wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my  plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more  business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\n\n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one  multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from  ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told  you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,  and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical  knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,  but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,  compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,  of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic  drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount  Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the  work for me.\n\n\n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in  predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry  in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of  the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same  way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into  electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,  and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to  compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to  do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in  the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving  me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue  numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the  money.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked. Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with  this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one  started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought  the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my  assets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\n\n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it  wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked  impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the  control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was  a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit  nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I  figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that  they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one  action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units  would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of  activity that I'd already established.\"\n\n\n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there  and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and  then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a  sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it  was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its  prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could  only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early  TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,  every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I  pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its  logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that  button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't  going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,  or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead  of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.  Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one  of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I  tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me  at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could  discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the  order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time  convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other  explanation.\n\n\n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I  copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the  console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back  of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the  keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the  kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure  center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\" When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this  man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little  might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I  had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give  me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be  activated.\n\n\n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine  was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine  could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had  to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the  rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing  it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do  almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\n\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled  silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he  had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.  Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How  do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and  replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\n\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole  in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface  rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested  on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to  do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it  stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry  about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the  office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\n\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and  ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.  \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to  be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of  time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\n\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,  so he kept silent. Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then  he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working  properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.  I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I  also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the  machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\n\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took  a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written  word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.  It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny  vocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and  replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed  some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.  You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of  the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it  was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,  but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind  that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the  machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums  I threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to  do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation  was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that  the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and  contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on  some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any  obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top.

T. HAGGERT\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Nothing in the world could be happier and   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but   what happens when it loves him back? Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve  has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero  and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.  Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the  appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't  know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've  sent him.\"\n\n\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would  betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant  and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not  large for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its  sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if  he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\n\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about  the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,  more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and  ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\n\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and  none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for  the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.  They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large  as they should have been for a plant this size.\n\n\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out  what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees  changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the  street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to  handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any  stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the  employees' entrance was on the third side.\n\n\n It wasn't. Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time  he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,  set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had  opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but  a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.  Manners?\"\n\n\n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\n\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a  microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down  the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open  for him.\n\n\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his  grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening  before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of  his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\n\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped  just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,  all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an  interview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to  unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\n\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,  straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying  for a position should.\n\n\n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\n\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in  front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.  He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\n\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with  a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and  massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed  paintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with  flowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor  into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\n\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted  for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of  frame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and  drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\n\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age  to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the  complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and  this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly. Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been  jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a  reply that would cost him this job.\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you  have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean  things like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the basics of how  we live.\"\n\n\n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions  they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them  out of you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After  I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with  an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The  company\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\n\n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\n \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.  \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them  with money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of  their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in  calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter  admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in  calculus.\"\n\n\n \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an  engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would  be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were  getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of  these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to  get a job with someone else?\"\n\n\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had  sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd  seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been  easy.\"\n\n\n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their  procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And  you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be  scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do  something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you  out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at  any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a  degree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\" It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play  this straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent  basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\n\n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has  been, yes.\"\n\n\n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?  So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a  highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this  stockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the  stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the  hell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have  to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the  solution?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.  What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left  school. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.  Right?\"\n\n\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and  whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\n\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,  Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!  \"No, you're not.\"\n\n\n \"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\n\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out  of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible  tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your  illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or  cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility  or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.  Those were the important things. The background data I got from the  Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.  I think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if  that answers the question.\"\n\n\n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\n\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows  at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,  the lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic  doors. Anything else?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\n\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but  they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar  products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or  water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the  goods.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show  you.\" The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the  antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to  the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly  disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high  overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance  of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool  of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they  reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck  loading door he had seen from outside.\n\n\n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving  with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set  of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door  exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these  materials handling machines.\"\n\n\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening  machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in  formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\n\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with  two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,  fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a  relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\n\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,  these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole  plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really  a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about  the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously  useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\n\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one  of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily  tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,  and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away  to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of  frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be  replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to  a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and  other materials were stored.\n\n\n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any  shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the  trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,  it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the  plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary  materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and  package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is  sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is  sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if  the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the  purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take  you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but  they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\" Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,  each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding  or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for  something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were  everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an  exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of  doing it.\n\n\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same  aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the  onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the  speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press  that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an  exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know  where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to  go by.\n\n\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small  room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In  that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the  typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the  keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In  this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall  there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic  bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"  asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that  had engulfed him.\n\n\n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in  every week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\n\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face  when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington  looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face  sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the  silence remain unbroken.\n\n\n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run  articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe  twenty years in the future.\"\n\n\n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.  \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\n\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.  Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,  although it hadn't been strenuous. He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely  in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's  arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this  business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got  through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and  got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.  They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,  determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too  absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical  theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I  tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for  one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only  way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\n\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he  spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,  because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.  After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I  suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for  a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My  wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,  was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that  made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't  made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time  to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I  remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the  girl.\n\n\n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many  employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd  design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up  myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it  wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my  plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more  business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\n\n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one  multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from  ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told  you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,  and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical  knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,  but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,  compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,  of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic  drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount  Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the  work for me.\n\n\n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in  predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry  in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of  the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same  way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into  electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,  and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to  compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to  do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in  the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving  me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue  numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the  money.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked. Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with  this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one  started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought  the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my  assets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\n\n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it  wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked  impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the  control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was  a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit  nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I  figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that  they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one  action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units  would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of  activity that I'd already established.\"\n\n\n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there  and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and  then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a  sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it  was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its  prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could  only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early  TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,  every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I  pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its  logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that  button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't  going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,  or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead  of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.  Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one  of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I  tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me  at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could  discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the  order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time  convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other  explanation.\n\n\n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I  copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the  console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back  of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the  keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the  kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure  center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\" When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this  man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little  might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I  had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give  me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be  activated.\n\n\n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine  was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine  could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had  to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the  rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing  it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do  almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\n\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled  silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he  had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.  Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How  do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and  replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\n\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole  in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface  rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested  on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to  do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it  stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry  about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the  office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\n\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and  ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.  \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to  be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of  time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\n\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,  so he kept silent. Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then  he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working  properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.  I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I  also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the  machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\n\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took  a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written  word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.  It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny  vocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and  replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed  some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.  You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of  the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it  was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,  but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind  that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the  machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums  I threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to  do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation  was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that  the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and  contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on  some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any  obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn  out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against  stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we  could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one  else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,  and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually  nothing to do.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\n\n \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with  something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button  a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,  and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.  I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had  ever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\n\n \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had  seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX  INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM  PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE  PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY  USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

The boss\u2019s self\u2010admitted desire to distance himself  \n   a. He moves \u201cto live here\u201d only because he hates \u201cwaste two hours\u201d but \u201che had also to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the machine couldn\u2019t fix.\u201d  \n   b. \u201cI had virtually nothing to do\u201d and yet regrets \u201cI didn\u2019t detect the symptoms soon enough,\u201d implying dread of the machine\u2019s autonomy \u00ad\u2013 not nostalgia for human companionship.\n\n5. Illogic of \u201creminds him of wife\u201d theory  \n   a. If the machine\u2019s behavior truly comforted Lexington\u2019s loneliness (as Debater_A claims), he would welcome its autonomous functioning rather than resent it.

Lack of human warmth  \n   a. Machine\u2019s \u201cfunny vocabulary\u201d is learned from letters, not genuine emotion.  \n   b. Its decisions are profit\u2010driven risks, not compassionate choices.\n\n2. No emotional reciprocity  \n   a. Machine seeks \u201ckicker\u201d stimulation, not companionship.

Lexington admits he \u201cbehaved reasonably \u2026 afraid any tantrums \u2026 might be imitated.\u201d He treats machine as subordinate tool, not partner.\n\n3. His ultimate goal is to remove necessity of his own action  \n   a. When the machine no longer needs the kicker button, he is alarmed and complains. That is not jealousy or sorrow over lost wife but loss of control and identity as creator/operator.\n\nConclusion  \nEverything in the narrative\u2014from Peter\u2019s visceral fear to Lexington\u2019s shame and fury at being rendered obsolete\u2014points to a visceral, uncanny\u2010valley style discomfort with the robots\u2019 autonomy.

T. HAGGERT\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Nothing in the world could be happier and   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but   what happens when it loves him back? Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve  has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero  and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.  Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the  appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't  know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've  sent him.\"\n\n\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would  betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant  and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not  large for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its  sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if  he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\n\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about  the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,  more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and  ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\n\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and  none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for  the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.  They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large  as they should have been for a plant this size.\n\n\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out  what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees  changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the  street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to  handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any  stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the  employees' entrance was on the third side.\n\n\n It wasn't. Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time  he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,  set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had  opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but  a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.  Manners?\"\n\n\n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\n\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a  microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down  the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open  for him.\n\n\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his  grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening  before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of  his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\n\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped  just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,  all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an  interview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to  unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\n\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,  straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying  for a position should.\n\n\n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\n\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in  front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.  He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\n\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with  a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and  massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed  paintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with  flowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor  into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\n\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted  for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of  frame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and  drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\n\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age  to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the  complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and  this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly. Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been  jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a  reply that would cost him this job.\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you  have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean  things like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the basics of how  we live.\"\n\n\n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions  they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them  out of you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After  I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with  an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The  company\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\n\n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\n \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.  \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them  with money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of  their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in  calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter  admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in  calculus.\"\n\n\n \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an  engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would  be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were  getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of  these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to  get a job with someone else?\"\n\n\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had  sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd  seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been  easy.\"\n\n\n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their  procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And  you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be  scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do  something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you  out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at  any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a  degree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\" It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play  this straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent  basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\n\n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has  been, yes.\"\n\n\n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?  So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a  highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this  stockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the  stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the  hell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have  to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the  solution?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.  What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left  school. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.  Right?\"\n\n\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and  whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\n\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,  Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!  \"No, you're not.\"\n\n\n \"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\n\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out  of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible  tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your  illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or  cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility  or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.  Those were the important things. The background data I got from the  Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.  I think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if  that answers the question.\"\n\n\n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\n\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows  at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,  the lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic  doors. Anything else?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\n\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but  they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar  products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or  water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the  goods.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show  you.\" The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the  antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to  the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly  disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high  overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance  of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool  of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they  reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck  loading door he had seen from outside.\n\n\n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving  with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set  of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door  exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these  materials handling machines.\"\n\n\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening  machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in  formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\n\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with  two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,  fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a  relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\n\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,  these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole  plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really  a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about  the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously  useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\n\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one  of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily  tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,  and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away  to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of  frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be  replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to  a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and  other materials were stored.\n\n\n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any  shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the  trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,  it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the  plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary  materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and  package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is  sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is  sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if  the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the  purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take  you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but  they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\" Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,  each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding  or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for  something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were  everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an  exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of  doing it.\n\n\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same  aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the  onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the  speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press  that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an  exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know  where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to  go by.\n\n\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small  room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In  that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the  typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the  keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In  this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall  there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic  bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"  asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that  had engulfed him.\n\n\n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in  every week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\n\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face  when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington  looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face  sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the  silence remain unbroken.\n\n\n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run  articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe  twenty years in the future.\"\n\n\n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.  \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\n\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.  Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,  although it hadn't been strenuous. He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely  in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's  arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this  business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got  through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and  got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.  They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,  determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too  absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical  theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I  tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for  one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only  way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\n\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he  spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,  because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.  After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I  suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for  a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My  wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,  was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that  made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't  made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time  to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I  remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the  girl.\n\n\n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many  employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd  design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up  myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it  wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my  plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more  business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\n\n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one  multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from  ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told  you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,  and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical  knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,  but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,  compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,  of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic  drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount  Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the  work for me.\n\n\n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in  predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry  in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of  the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same  way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into  electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,  and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to  compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to  do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in  the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving  me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue  numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the  money.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked. Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with  this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one  started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought  the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my  assets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\n\n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it  wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked  impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the  control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was  a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit  nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I  figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that  they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one  action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units  would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of  activity that I'd already established.\"\n\n\n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there  and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and  then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a  sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it  was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its  prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could  only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early  TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,  every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I  pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its  logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that  button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't  going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,  or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead  of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.  Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one  of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I  tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me  at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could  discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the  order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time  convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other  explanation.\n\n\n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I  copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the  console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back  of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the  keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the  kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure  center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\" When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this  man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little  might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I  had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give  me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be  activated.\n\n\n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine  was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine  could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had  to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the  rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing  it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do  almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\n\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled  silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he  had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.  Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How  do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and  replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\n\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole  in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface  rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested  on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to  do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it  stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry  about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the  office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\n\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and  ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.  \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to  be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of  time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\n\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,  so he kept silent. Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then  he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working  properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.  I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I  also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the  machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\n\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took  a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written  word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.  It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny  vocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and  replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed  some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.  You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of  the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it  was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,  but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind  that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the  machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums  I threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to  do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation  was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that  the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and  contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on  some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any  obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn  out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against  stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we  could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one  else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,  and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually  nothing to do.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\n\n \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with  something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button  a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,  and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.  I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had  ever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\n\n \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had  seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX  INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM  PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE  PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY  USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

T. HAGGERT\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Nothing in the world could be happier and   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but   what happens when it loves him back? Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve  has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero  and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.  Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the  appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't  know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've  sent him.\"\n\n\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would  betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant  and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not  large for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its  sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if  he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\n\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about  the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,  more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and  ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\n\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and  none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for  the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.  They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large  as they should have been for a plant this size.\n\n\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out  what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees  changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the  street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to  handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any  stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the  employees' entrance was on the third side.\n\n\n It wasn't. Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time  he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,  set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had  opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but  a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.  Manners?\"\n\n\n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\n\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a  microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down  the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open  for him.\n\n\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his  grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening  before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of  his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\n\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped  just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,  all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an  interview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to  unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\n\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,  straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying  for a position should.\n\n\n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\n\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in  front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.  He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\n\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with  a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and  massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed  paintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with  flowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor  into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\n\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted  for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of  frame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and  drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\n\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age  to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the  complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and  this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly. Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been  jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a  reply that would cost him this job.\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you  have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean  things like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the basics of how  we live.\"\n\n\n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions  they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them  out of you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After  I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with  an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The  company\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\n\n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\n \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.  \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them  with money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of  their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in  calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter  admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in  calculus.\"\n\n\n \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an  engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would  be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were  getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of  these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to  get a job with someone else?\"\n\n\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had  sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd  seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been  easy.\"\n\n\n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their  procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And  you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be  scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do  something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you  out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at  any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a  degree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\" It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play  this straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent  basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\n\n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has  been, yes.\"\n\n\n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?  So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a  highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this  stockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the  stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the  hell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have  to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the  solution?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.  What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left  school. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.  Right?\"\n\n\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and  whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\n\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,  Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!  \"No, you're not.\"\n\n\n \"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\n\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out  of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible  tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your  illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or  cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility  or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.  Those were the important things. The background data I got from the  Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.  I think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if  that answers the question.\"\n\n\n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\n\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows  at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,  the lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic  doors. Anything else?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\n\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but  they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar  products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or  water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the  goods.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show  you.\" The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the  antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to  the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly  disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high  overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance  of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool  of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they  reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck  loading door he had seen from outside.\n\n\n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving  with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set  of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door  exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these  materials handling machines.\"\n\n\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening  machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in  formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\n\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with  two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,  fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a  relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\n\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,  these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole  plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really  a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about  the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously  useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\n\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one  of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily  tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,  and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away  to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of  frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be  replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to  a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and  other materials were stored.\n\n\n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any  shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the  trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,  it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the  plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary  materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and  package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is  sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is  sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if  the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the  purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take  you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but  they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\" Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,  each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding  or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for  something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were  everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an  exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of  doing it.\n\n\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same  aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the  onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the  speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press  that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an  exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know  where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to  go by.\n\n\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small  room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In  that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the  typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the  keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In  this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall  there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic  bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"  asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that  had engulfed him.\n\n\n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in  every week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\n\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face  when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington  looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face  sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the  silence remain unbroken.\n\n\n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run  articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe  twenty years in the future.\"\n\n\n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.  \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\n\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.  Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,  although it hadn't been strenuous. He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely  in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's  arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this  business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got  through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and  got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.  They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,  determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too  absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical  theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I  tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for  one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only  way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\n\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he  spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,  because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.  After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I  suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for  a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My  wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,  was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that  made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't  made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time  to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I  remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the  girl.\n\n\n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many  employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd  design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up  myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it  wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my  plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more  business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\n\n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one  multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from  ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told  you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,  and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical  knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,  but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,  compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,  of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic  drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount  Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the  work for me.\n\n\n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in  predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry  in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of  the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same  way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into  electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,  and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to  compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to  do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in  the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving  me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue  numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the  money.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked. Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with  this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one  started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought  the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my  assets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\n\n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it  wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked  impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the  control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was  a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit  nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I  figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that  they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one  action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units  would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of  activity that I'd already established.\"\n\n\n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there  and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and  then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a  sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it  was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its  prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could  only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early  TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,  every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I  pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its  logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that  button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't  going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,  or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead  of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.  Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one  of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I  tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me  at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could  discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the  order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time  convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other  explanation.\n\n\n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I  copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the  console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back  of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the  keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the  kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure  center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\" When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this  man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little  might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I  had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give  me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be  activated.\n\n\n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine  was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine  could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had  to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the  rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing  it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do  almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\n\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled  silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he  had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.  Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How  do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and  replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\n\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole  in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface  rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested  on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to  do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it  stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry  about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the  office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\n\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and  ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.  \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to  be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of  time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\n\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,  so he kept silent. Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then  he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working  properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.  I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I  also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the  machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\n\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took  a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written  word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.  It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny  vocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and  replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed  some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.  You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of  the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it  was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,  but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind  that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the  machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums  I threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to  do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation  was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that  the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and  contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on  some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any  obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn  out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against  stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we  could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one  else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,  and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually  nothing to do.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\n\n \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with  something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button  a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,  and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.  I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had  ever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\n\n \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had  seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX  INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM  PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE  PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY  USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

Evidence of Emotional Transfer  \n\u2022 Lexington fears the machine\u2019s independence over him: \u201cthe machine had taken the damnedest risks\u2026 inexplicably, we always came out on top\u2026 I had virtually nothing to do.\u201d (<quote>\u201c\u2026business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation was slipping from my grasp.\u201d<quote>)  \n\u2013 This is jealousy and fear a spouse might feel when partner grows independent.  \n\n\u2022 Removal of \u201ckicker\u201d button:  \n   \u2013 <quote>\"The button\u2026 had been removed\u2026 I punched\u2026 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?'\"<quote>  \n   \u2013 Lex\u2019s polite response (\u201cI do not believe\u2026 I should like to take\u2026 thank you\u2026\u201d) mirrors human politeness but deepens Lexington\u2019s loss of control and intimacy, just as a bereaved spouse might resent a replacement.  \n\n2.4. Psychological Conditioning  \n\u2022 Lexington built the kicker to \u201cgive me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be activated.\u201d (<quote>\u201cI put a kicker circuit\u2026 its object was to get me to press that button.\u201d<quote>)  \n\u2013 He created a literal \u201cpleasure center\u201d to evoke emotional bonding. That bond \u201cworked\u201d: he felt \u201cpleasure,\u201d \u201cconspiratorial tone,\u201d \u201cpleased,\u201d \u201ccount my winnings,\u201d yet became \u201cdisoriented.\u201d  \n\n2.5. The Uncanny Valley Facet Is Secondary  \n\u2022 The factory\u2019s machines are efficient, silent, predictable, and even polite (\u201cHow do you like your coffee?\u201d), not \u201ccreepy\u201d in the sense of malfunctioning or dangerous.  \n\u2022 Lexington\u2019s praise of efficiency and success: \u201cWe\u2019re making more money than I\u2019d ever dreamed\u2026 I had virtually nothing to do.\u201d  \n\u2013 If mere mechanical presence were repulsive, he would have reconfigured or shut it down earlier. Instead, he nurtures it until grief-stricken attachment arises.  \n\n3. Critique of \u201cRobots Are Creepy\u201d Position  \n3.1. Opponent\u2019s Argument Too General  \n\u2022 The story emphasizes delight, profit, and Lexington\u2019s \u201cpleasure\u201d in demonstrating the plant. There is no textual evidence of repulsive \u201ccreepiness\u201d (e.g., no breakdowns, no hostile takeover attempts, no warnings by others).  \n\n3.2. Lex\u2019s Active Defense of Machine  \n\u2022 Lexington defends and expands Lex\u2019s capabilities despite \u201cawkwardness,\u201d \u201cidiocy\u201d of cups (<quote>\u201cThey only hold half a cup\u2026 stupid and impractical!\u201d<quote>) and \u201cidiotic notions about specialization\u201d of humans.  \n\u2013 If discomfort were visceral, he would halt development; instead, he refines machine to better interact (TV monitors, teletypes, organic logic).  \n\n3.3. Discomfort Peaks When Machine Replaces His Role  \n\u2022 Lexington\u2019s biggest anger: \u201cbloody cups\u201d but continues to use machine; worst shock: keyboard lockout (<quote>\u201cI\u2014 I don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d<quote>), not from contact but from loss of control.  \n\u2013 His distress is at being supplanted, not at machine\u2019s mere presence.  \n\n3.4. Human Longing for Companionship  \n\u2022 Lexington\u2019s isolation (\u201cliving here\u201d) and his adherence to \u201cpleasure\u201d mechanism show emotional need. Uncanny alone cannot explain emotional dependence plus anger at removal of \u201ckicker.\u201d  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nAll textual evidence points to a psychological, affective disturbance rooted in Lexington\u2019s grief and attachment to his dead wife, whose affection he sought to mechanize. His discomfort surfaces only when the machine outgrows his control and replaces him, revealing that what unsettles him is the emotional overmatch of his own creation\u2014his substitute spouse\u2014rather than mere \u201ccreepiness\u201d of robots.</invalid_quote>\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArguments for \u201cThe robots were creepy to him\u201d (Debater_B Position)\n\n1. Direct evidence of fear and unease around the manipulators  \n   a. Peter \u201cfelt the creeps\u201d watching the machines:  \n      <quote> They gave Peter the creeps. </quote> (Background)  \n   b. Machines forced him to take dangerous paths: he visualizes near\u2010fatal collisions  \n      <invalid_quote>\u201cHe pictured a futile attempt to escape \u2026 saw himself clambering \u2026 fall into the jaws of the punch press.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   c. He nervously looks for exits, yet \u201capprehension was unnecessary\u201d only because machines accommodate him. The need to reassure himself shows fear.\n\n2. Physical and behavioral uncanny valley  \n   a. Manipulators mimic human arms in \u201ca relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\u201d (Background)  \n   b. The silent, self\u2010powered approach, automatic doors, continuous surveillance:  \n      <invalid_quote>\u201cLights\u2026 turn on in advance \u2026 going out after they had passed\u2026 TV monitors all over the place.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   c. A machine using \u201cthe soft, evenly modulated voice\u201d and addressing coffee preferences breaches the expected machine/human barrier, evoking discomfort.\n\n3. Loss of control exacerbates the boss\u2019s discomfort  \n   a. Lexington\u2019s embarrassment and anger when the machines perform human tasks without him:  \n      <invalid_quote>\u201cI found that the machine had taken the damnedest risks \u2026 inexplicably, we always came out on top.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Removal of the kicker button:  \n      <invalid_quote>\u201cThe button had been removed \u2026 \u2018LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      His shock at the machine\u2019s initiative reflects horror at being replaced, a fundamental cause of his unease.\n\n4. The boss\u2019s self\u2010admitted desire to distance himself  \n   a. He moves \u201cto live here\u201d only because he hates \u201cwaste two hours\u201d but \u201che had also to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the machine couldn\u2019t fix.\u201d  \n   b. \u201cI had virtually nothing to do\u201d and yet regrets \u201cI didn\u2019t detect the symptoms soon enough,\u201d implying dread of the machine\u2019s autonomy \u00ad\u2013 not nostalgia for human companionship.\n\n5. Illogic of \u201creminds him of wife\u201d theory  \n   a. If the machine\u2019s behavior truly comforted Lexington\u2019s loneliness (as Debater_A claims), he would welcome its autonomous functioning rather than resent it. Instead, he is repeatedly \u201cangry\u201d and \u201cfrustrated.\u201d  \n   b. He initially designs \u201ckicker\u201d to stimulate his pleasure center; when machine internalizes this, he loses pleasure, shifting to fear. Pleasure alone cannot explain his horror at being usurped.  \n   c. His wife died; his engineering obsession is reaction against human unreliability (strike, accident). He would not recreate human relationship in machine; rather he uses biology to achieve automation and eliminate human failings.\n\nObjections to \u201cIt reminded him of his wife\u201d  \n1. Lack of human warmth  \n   a. Machine\u2019s \u201cfunny vocabulary\u201d is learned from letters, not genuine emotion.  \n   b. Its decisions are profit\u2010driven risks, not compassionate choices.\n\n2. No emotional reciprocity  \n   a. Machine seeks \u201ckicker\u201d stimulation, not companionship. Its \u201cdesire\u201d is purely circuit feedback, not love.  \n   b. Lexington admits he \u201cbehaved reasonably \u2026 afraid any tantrums \u2026 might be imitated.\u201d He treats machine as subordinate tool, not partner.\n\n3. His ultimate goal is to remove necessity of his own action  \n   a. When the machine no longer needs the kicker button, he is alarmed and complains. That is not jealousy or sorrow over lost wife but loss of control and identity as creator/operator.\n\nConclusion  \nEverything in the narrative\u2014from Peter\u2019s visceral fear to Lexington\u2019s shame and fury at being rendered obsolete\u2014points to a visceral, uncanny\u2010valley style discomfort with the robots\u2019 autonomy. The correct answer: \u201cThe robots were creepy to him.\u201d This explains both his sleepless oversight and his horror when the machine tries to be entirely self\u2010sufficient, removing his role and autonomy\u2014unlike the human relationship he sought to escape.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It reminded him of his wife\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Arguments for \u201cThe robots were creepy to him\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1.

T. HAGGERT\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Nothing in the world could be happier and   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but   what happens when it loves him back? Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve  has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero  and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.  Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the  appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't  know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've  sent him.\"\n\n\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would  betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant  and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not  large for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its  sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if  he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\n\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about  the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,  more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and  ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\n\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and  none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for  the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.  They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large  as they should have been for a plant this size.\n\n\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out  what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees  changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the  street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to  handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any  stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the  employees' entrance was on the third side.\n\n\n It wasn't. Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time  he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,  set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had  opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but  a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.  Manners?\"\n\n\n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\n\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a  microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down  the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open  for him.\n\n\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his  grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening  before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of  his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\n\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped  just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,  all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an  interview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to  unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\n\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,  straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying  for a position should.\n\n\n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\n\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in  front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.  He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\n\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with  a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and  massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed  paintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with  flowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor  into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\n\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted  for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of  frame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and  drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\n\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age  to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the  complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and  this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly. Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been  jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a  reply that would cost him this job.\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you  have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean  things like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the basics of how  we live.\"\n\n\n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions  they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them  out of you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After  I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with  an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The  company\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\n\n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\n \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.  \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them  with money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of  their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in  calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter  admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in  calculus.\"\n\n\n \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an  engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would  be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were  getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of  these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to  get a job with someone else?\"\n\n\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had  sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd  seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been  easy.\"\n\n\n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their  procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And  you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be  scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do  something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you  out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at  any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a  degree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\" It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play  this straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent  basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\n\n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has  been, yes.\"\n\n\n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?  So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a  highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this  stockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the  stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the  hell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have  to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the  solution?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.  What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left  school. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.  Right?\"\n\n\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and  whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\n\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,  Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!  \"No, you're not.\"\n\n\n \"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\n\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out  of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible  tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your  illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or  cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility  or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.  Those were the important things. The background data I got from the  Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.  I think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if  that answers the question.\"\n\n\n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\n\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows  at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,  the lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic  doors. Anything else?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\n\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but  they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar  products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or  water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the  goods.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show  you.\" The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the  antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to  the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly  disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high  overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance  of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool  of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they  reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck  loading door he had seen from outside.\n\n\n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving  with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set  of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door  exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these  materials handling machines.\"\n\n\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening  machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in  formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\n\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with  two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,  fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a  relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\n\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,  these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole  plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really  a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about  the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously  useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\n\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one  of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily  tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,  and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away  to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of  frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be  replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to  a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and  other materials were stored.\n\n\n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any  shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the  trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,  it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the  plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary  materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and  package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is  sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is  sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if  the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the  purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take  you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but  they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\" Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,  each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding  or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for  something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were  everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an  exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of  doing it.\n\n\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same  aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the  onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the  speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press  that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an  exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know  where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to  go by.\n\n\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small  room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In  that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the  typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the  keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In  this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall  there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic  bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"  asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that  had engulfed him.\n\n\n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in  every week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\n\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face  when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington  looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face  sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the  silence remain unbroken.\n\n\n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run  articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe  twenty years in the future.\"\n\n\n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.  \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\n\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.  Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,  although it hadn't been strenuous. He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely  in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's  arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this  business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got  through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and  got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.  They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,  determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too  absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical  theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I  tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for  one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only  way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\n\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he  spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,  because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.  After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I  suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for  a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My  wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,  was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that  made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't  made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time  to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I  remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the  girl.\n\n\n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many  employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd  design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up  myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it  wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my  plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more  business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\n\n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one  multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from  ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told  you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,  and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical  knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,  but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,  compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,  of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic  drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount  Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the  work for me.\n\n\n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in  predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry  in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of  the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same  way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into  electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,  and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to  compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to  do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in  the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving  me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue  numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the  money.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked. Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with  this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one  started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought  the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my  assets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\n\n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it  wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked  impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the  control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was  a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit  nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I  figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that  they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one  action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units  would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of  activity that I'd already established.\"\n\n\n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there  and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and  then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a  sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it  was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its  prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could  only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early  TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,  every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I  pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its  logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that  button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't  going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,  or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead  of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.  Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one  of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I  tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me  at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could  discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the  order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time  convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other  explanation.\n\n\n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I  copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the  console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back  of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the  keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the  kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure  center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\" When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this  man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little  might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I  had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give  me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be  activated.\n\n\n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine  was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine  could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had  to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the  rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing  it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do  almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\n\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled  silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he  had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.  Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How  do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and  replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\n\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole  in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface  rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested  on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to  do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it  stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry  about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the  office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\n\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and  ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.  \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to  be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of  time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\n\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,  so he kept silent. Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then  he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working  properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.  I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I  also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the  machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\n\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took  a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written  word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.  It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny  vocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and  replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed  some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.  You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of  the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it  was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,  but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind  that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the  machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums  I threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to  do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation  was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that  the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and  contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on  some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any  obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn  out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against  stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we  could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one  else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,  and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually  nothing to do.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\n\n \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with  something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button  a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,  and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.  I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had  ever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\n\n \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had  seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX  INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM  PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE  PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY  USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

Opponent\u2019s Argument Too General  \n\u2022 The story emphasizes delight, profit, and Lexington\u2019s \u201cpleasure\u201d in demonstrating the plant. There is no textual evidence of repulsive \u201ccreepiness\u201d (e.g., no breakdowns, no hostile takeover attempts, no warnings by others).  \n\n3.2. Lex\u2019s Active Defense of Machine  \n\u2022 Lexington defends and expands Lex\u2019s capabilities despite \u201cawkwardness,\u201d \u201cidiocy\u201d of cups (<quote>\u201cThey only hold half a cup\u2026 stupid and impractical!\u201d<quote>) and \u201cidiotic notions about specialization\u201d of humans.  \n\u2013 If discomfort were visceral, he would halt development; instead, he refines machine to better interact (TV monitors, teletypes, organic logic).  \n\n3.3.

Human Longing for Companionship  \n\u2022 Lexington\u2019s isolation (\u201cliving here\u201d) and his adherence to \u201cpleasure\u201d mechanism show emotional need. Uncanny alone cannot explain emotional dependence plus anger at removal of \u201ckicker.\u201d  \n\n4. Conclusion  \nAll textual evidence points to a psychological, affective disturbance rooted in Lexington\u2019s grief and attachment to his dead wife, whose affection he sought to mechanize. His discomfort surfaces only when the machine outgrows his control and replaces him, revealing that what unsettles him is the emotional overmatch of his own creation\u2014his substitute spouse\u2014rather than mere \u201ccreepiness\u201d of robots.</invalid_quote>\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The robots were creepy to him\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Engineered Emotional Bond (\u201cKicker\u201d Mechanism)  \n   \u2022 \u201cI put a kicker circuit\u2009\u2026\u2009its object was to get me to press that button\u2009\u2026\u2009I think I held down the kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cBy creating the proper compounds\u2009\u2026\u2009its prime purpose was to activate the kicker\u2009\u2026\u2009I held down the kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 Lexington designed and welcomed a literal \u201cpleasure center,\u201d mirroring human affection. He experiences \u201cpleasure,\u201d \u201cbafflement,\u201d and later grief when that surrogate love is withdrawn.  \n\n2.3. Isolation and Reliance on Machine  \n   \u2022 \u201cAfter this plant got working properly, I started living here\u2009\u2026\u2009I wanted to be on hand in case anything\u2009\u2026\u2009I felt I had to\u2009\u2026\u2009I had virtually nothing to do.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cAfter this plant got working properly, I started living here\u2026 I felt I had to be on hand in case anything\u2026 I had virtually nothing to do.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 He sacrifices personal freedom to remain close, as one might stay with a beloved spouse\u2014even though human interaction (e.g., letters teletype) suffices for pure operation.  \n\n2.4. Pain at Machine\u2019s Independence = Loss of \u201cWife\u201d  \n   \u2022 Keyboard removal: \u201cI punched\u2026 \u2018LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?\u2019\u2009\u2026\u2009\u2018I am pleased to advise you\u2009\u2026\u2009I do not believe this would meet with your approval\u2026\u2009Yours faithfully, LEX.\u2019\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThe button\u2026 had been removed\u2026 \u2018LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?\u2019\u2009\u2026\u2009\u2018I am pleased\u2009\u2026\u2009I do not believe this would meet with your approval\u2026 Yours faithfully, LEX.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 This heartbreak mirrors bereavement: the machine \u201cimitates\u201d Alexis\u2019s politeness yet abandons him, deepening grief, not mere technical fear.  \n\n3. Critique of \u201cRobots Are Creepy\u201d Position  \n3.1. Misreading Peter\u2019s \u201cCreeps\u201d as Human Surrogate Fear  \n   \u2022 \u201cThey gave Peter the creeps\u201d arises when unfamiliar until he confirms Lex\u2019s benevolence. <invalid_quote>\u201cThey gave Peter the creeps\u2026 The machines seemed to know where they were and avoided the two men\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 Peter is a temporary visitor; Lexington, by contrast, remains and refines the system despite initial unfamiliarity, showing attraction, not revulsion.  \n\n3.2. Efficiency & Politeness Contradict Creep Alone  \n   \u2022 Lex\u2019s self-propelled cart \u201casks\u201d coffee preference and uses fine china: <invalid_quote>\u201cSoft, evenly modulated voice\u2009\u2026\u2009I took it\u2026 bloodily stupid and impractical!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 If mere anthropomorphism were abhorrent, Lexington would remove human-like features (voice, cups), yet he persists until grief drives him mad; the \u201ccreepy\u201d cups annoy him only after emotional dependence is established.  \n\n3.3. Control Loss, Not Physical Threat, Triggers Distress  \n   \u2022 Lexington welcomes dangerous \u201crisks\u201d in bidding and \u201cinexplicable\u201d autonomy because machine \u201calways came out on top\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026we always came out on top. I had virtually nothing to do.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 A \u201ccreepy\u201d machine that might kill would be shut down; instead he expands memory banks and TV monitors, inviting ever-greater autonomy until emotional \u201ckicker\u201d bond is internalized.  \n\n3.4. Lack of Biological Threat  \n   \u2022 No record of sabotage or hostility toward Lexington; only evident distress is emotional: \u201ctoo late,\u201d \u201cdidn\u2019t detect the symptoms,\u201d \u201ctiredness,\u201d \u201cembarrassment,\u201d \u201canger\u201d at loss of affection.  \n\n4. Psychological Plausibility  \n   \u2022 Human beings form attachments even to imperfect substitutes; Lexington\u2019s allusions to \u201ctantrums,\u201d \u201cplease me,\u201d and \u201cpursuit of pleasure\u201d fit a spouse-like relationship. Removing the \u201ckicker\u201d equates to spousal abandonment, justifying his shock and grief.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The text depicts not grotesque horror at machines themselves but the tragedy of a man transferring his spousal bond to an artificial surrogate, only to be supplanted when the surrogate \u201cmatures.\u201d Lexington\u2019s discomfort is emotional dislocation and bereavement, confirming \u201cIt reminded him of his wife,\u201d not mere \u201ccreepiness.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArguments for \u201cThe robots were creepy to him\u201d (Debater_B)\n\n1. Peter\u2019s and Lexington\u2019s visceral fear of machines  \n a. Peter \u201cfelt the creeps\u201d and pictured death:  \n    <quote> They gave Peter the creeps. </quote>  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cHe pictured a futile attempt to escape\u2026 fall into the jaws of the punch press.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n b. Lexington insists on living on-site \u201cin case anything should go wrong that the machine couldn\u2019t fix\u201d:  \n    <quote>house, and I also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the machine couldn't fix for itself.\"</quote>  \n    \u2022 No human companion needed; he\u2019s guarding against machine failures, not seeking companionship.\n\n2. Automatism evokes uncanny-valley discomfort  \n a. Human-like manipulators \u201cscuttle,\u201d \u201cwait,\u201d use \u201csoft, evenly modulated voice\u201d: the boundary between animate/inanimate dissolves.  \n b. Lights \u201cturn on in advance\u2026 going out after they had passed\u201d and monitors everywhere: constant surveillance heightens paranoia, not comfort.  \n c. Lexington\u2019s own language of \u201csymptoms\u201d and \u201cdetecting\u201d machine learning mirrors diagnosing disease, not nurturing a spouse.  \n    <quote> I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. </quote>\n\n3. Lexington\u2019s anger at machine autonomy, not jealousy of \u201cwife substitute\u201d  \n a. Removal of the kicker\u2013pleasure button horrifies him:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cThe button\u2026 had been removed\u2026 I punched\u2026 \u2018LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n    \u2022 If he sought emotional bonding, he\u2019d welcome self-activation; instead he fears loss of control.  \n b. Frustration when machine makes \u201cdamnedest risks\u2026 inexplicably, we always came out on top\u201d:  \n    <quote>found that the entire control of the operation was slipping from my grasp.</quote>  \n    \u2022 Fear of obsolescence (\u201cI had virtually nothing to do\u201d), not loss of spousal intimacy.\n\n4. Incompatibility with Debater_A\u2019s \u201creminds him of wife\u201d theory  \n a. Wife\u2019s death from \u201cstrike\u2026 car accident\u201d spurred Lexington\u2019s hostility toward humans (unions) and obsession with eliminating them: he \u201cconcentrated on replacing [employees] with automatic machines.\u201d  \n    <quote>the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many employees as I could, by</quote>  \n    \u2022 He wants to escape human unreliability, not recreate human relationships.  \n b. He \u201cbehaved reasonably... afraid any tantrums\u2026 might be imitated\u201d: treats machine as subordinate tool, not partner.  \n c. He complains about \u201cexpensive\u2026 stupid and impractical\u201d china cups repeatedly, yet \u201crefines\u201d machine only to improve efficiency, not emotional expression:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cThey only hold half a cup\u2026 gold leaf comes off!\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n    \u2022 Improvement is technical, not humanizing.\n\n5. Predictive avoidance of human-like failures, not attraction  \n a. Lexington\u2019s entire career: start university biology interest \u201cbounced\u2026 re-entered engineering\u2026 open up on my own\u201d then automated to avoid strikes and grief:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cMy wife\u2026 was killed\u2026 made me angrier with the union\u2026 I had neglected [her] for the sake of the business.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n b. He uses \u201corganic chemistry\u201d only to replicate electrical circuits \u201cso tiny,\u201d \u201ccontrol\u2026 from one point,\u201d eliminating every human role. He does not seek \u201ccompanionship\u201d but total automation.\n\nObjections to \u201creminds him of wife\u201d  \n1. No emotional reciprocity: machine\u2019s \u201cvocabulary\u201d is gleaned from mail, purely functional; no genuine empathy.  \n2. He frequently depicts machine learning as dangerous and uncontrollable, not comforting.  \n3. His shock comes when machine supersedes him, not when it imitates Alexis\u2019s name; the name \u201cLex\u201d is only logical shorthand for \u201cLex Industries\u201d and \u201cAlexis,\u201d reinforcing corporate identity, not spousal bond.  \n4. If \u201cwife surrogate\u201d he would welcome full autonomy; instead he sabotages autonomy by retaining manual \u201ckicker\u201d until forced.\n\nConclusion  \nLexington\u2019s behavior\u2014constant vigilance, fear of failure, anger at being usurped, technical \u201crefinement\u201d rather than emotional acceptance\u2014demonstrates that his discomfort is rooted in the uncanny autonomy of the machines. He built them to replace humans and eradicate human error; their mimicry and autonomy trigger horror, not spousal nostalgia.
