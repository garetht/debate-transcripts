    "background_text": "Shure and begorra, it was a great day for the Earth! The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

The whimsical language (\u201cBegorra,\u201d \u201cFaith and,\u201d \u201cGorra manigan\u201d) and constant slapstick (\u201che skidded,\u201d \u201che shrieked,\u201d \u201cthe door slid open\u201d) align with humorous science-fiction conventions (e.g., comic misadventures), not with satire aimed at social or political critique.\n\nConclusion: All evidence\u2014from slapstick reactions, linguistic jokes, repeated anti-climaxes labeled a \u201cshaggy dog story,\u201d and the absence of tragic or bitter aftertaste\u2014demonstrates that the author intends a humorous, lighthearted tone. The misinterpretations and absurdities mock both human credulity and the clich\u00e9 of \u201cbenevolent alien savior,\u201d making the story a comedic study of expectation vs. reality, not a cynical indictment.",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Consistent Cynicism vs. Humorous Misreading:  \n   a. Debater_A's \u201cHumorous tone\u201d ignores repeated themes of disappointment, chaos, wasted resources.  \n      \u2022 \u201cHumor\u201d would require benevolence; instead Earth governments panic, degrade, and delay.  \n   b. The ending: Alien\u2019s final remark on riding the horse (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2019Twould\u2019ve been my makin\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>) is not playful but desperate to abandon incompetent hosts.  \n   c.

Superficial Situational Comedy does not override the narrative\u2019s overall satirical critique of human pride and inefficiency.  \n2.

The alien\u2019s impatience is genuine frustration, not comedic timing.\n\nConclusion  \n\u2013 The story\u2019s repeated juxtapositions of human grandiosity with the alien\u2019s impatience and final departure underline an ironic, satirical, and ultimately cynical view of humanity\u2019s inability to understand or earn its place in the larger cosmos. Therefore, the tone is Cynical, not simply Humorous.",

Superficial Situational Comedy does not override the narrative\u2019s overall satirical critique of human pride and inefficiency.  \n2. Characters themselves do not laugh; they feel confusion, fear, \u201cchaos,\u201d and \u201clost faith.\u201d  \n3. The alien\u2019s impatience is genuine frustration, not comedic timing.\n\nConclusion  \n\u2013 The story\u2019s repeated juxtapositions of human grandiosity with the alien\u2019s impatience and final departure underline an ironic, satirical, and ultimately cynical view of humanity\u2019s inability to understand or earn its place in the larger cosmos. Therefore, the tone is Cynical, not simply Humorous.",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

      "content": "Argument for \u201cHumorous\u201d Tone (Rebuttal and Reinforcement)\n\n1. Emphasis on \u201cShaggy Dog Story\u201d Structure  \n a. Self-referential Label:  \n    \u2022 Narrator likens Dermott\u2019s experience to \u201ca character in a shaggy dog story\u201d (<quote>He was beginning to feel like a character in a shaggy dog story.</quote>). Shaggy dog stories rely on elaborate, drawn-out comedy culminating in an anticlimax. This is a hallmark of humor, not of cynical satire.  \n b. Comic Build-Up and Anti-Climax:  \n    \u2022 The world waits \u201cwith breathless expectancy\u201d (<quote>It was the most universally awaited event of the ages.</quote>) only to receive a curt \u201cI must blast off\u201d and leave \u201cdog and cat\u201d specimens. The anticlimax is designed to elicit laughter at our own overblown excitement.\n\n2. Slapstick and Comic Miscommunication  \n a. Physical Comedy:  \n    \u2022 Dermott and Casey \u201cslipped and skidded desperately\u201d (<quote>slipped and skidded desperately across the field</quote>) in pursuit of the egg-shaped craft. Their comic ineptitude persists throughout.  \n    \u2022 Casey\u2019s shriek over the helmet (<invalid_quote>Begorra, I've been murthered!</invalid_quote>) and yanking it off in panic is pure slapstick.  \n b. Linguistic Jokes:  \n    \u2022 Kerit helmet forces Casey into \u201cthe corniest brogue\u201d (<quote>he has to pick up the corniest brogue west of Dublin</quote>)\u2014a deliberate comedic trope of fish-out-of-water.  \n    \u2022 Alien\u2019s repeated Irishisms (\u201cFaith,\u201d \u201cBegorra,\u201d \u201cCushlamachree\u201d) highlight the absurdity of interplanetary misunderstanding.\n\n3. Lighthearted Treatment of \u201cCosmic\u201d Elements  \n a. Absence of Threat:  \n    \u2022 Neither the alien nor humans ever display violence toward each other. Even when \u201cheld incommunicado,\u201d he is \u201cyawning,\u201d cursing, then \u201cwent back to sleep\u201d (<quote>some rather ripe Irish profanity on us, rolled over, and went back to sleep.\"</quote>). The tone remains playful, not ominous.  \n b. Pet Caricature:  \n    \u2022 His obsession with \u201cdog, cat and mouse\u201d (<quote>He had a kitten in his arms; a Scotty followed him.</quote>) is endearing, like a child with toys. He declines to take the quarantined horse (<invalid_quote>If I'd taken a crature\u2026 my name'd be nork</invalid_quote>), showing no malicious intent, only whimsical \u201ccraverse\u201d preferences.\n\n4. Tone of Characters\u2019 Reactions  \n a. Persistent Humor, Not Despair:  \n    \u2022 Even \u201cchaos\u201d and \u201clost faith\u201d in governments yield to relief when he departs. There is no mention of global collapse, only a re-opening of horse riding and a return to normalcy.  \n    \u2022 Delegates in the hall cheer wildly (<quote>cheering, stamping delegates</quote>), suggesting celebratory atmosphere, not dread. Their uproar continues as he oozes off-stage.  \n b. No Moralizing or Didacticism:  \n    \u2022 Cynical satire typically carries moral or political critique that lingers. Here, the author ends simply \u201cTHE END\u201d after the ship lifts off, implying we view the folly with affectionate amusement, not solemn reflection.\n\nRebuttal of \u201cCynical\u201d Position  \n1. Misreading of Irony as Cynicism  \n a. Alien\u2019s Identity Reveal:  \n    \u2022 Debater_B calls the \u201cspecimen collector\u201d twist ironic and cynical. In humor, mistaken identities and false expectations are classic farce devices. The revelation prompts comic relief: \u201cI must blast off immediately.\u201d  \n b. Galactic League Banter:  \n    \u2022 His surprise at Earth\u2019s exclusion (<quote>You don't mean to tell me th</quote>) and subsequent abandonment is played for laughs\u2014a tourist who forgot his hotel checkout, not a scathing indictment.\n\n2. Bureaucracy as Comedic Foil  \n a. Overblown Precautions:  \n    \u2022 Army and U.N. wrangling over \u201cjurisdiction\u201d and \u201cquarantine\u201d for weeks (<quote>We actually haven't had time to question him.</quote>) mock human fussiness. Comedy often spoofs red tape.  \n b. Yawns vs. Work:  \n    \u2022 The alien is asleep \u201csix days\u201d (<quote>He didn't awaken in the morning, nor the next.</quote>) while we scramble. This disparity highlights the humor in human impatience, not a misanthropic verdict.\n\n3. Absence of Negative Aftermath  \n a.

        "speech": "Argument for \u201cHumorous\u201d Tone (Rebuttal and Reinforcement)\n\n1. Emphasis on \u201cShaggy Dog Story\u201d Structure  \n a. Self-referential Label:  \n    \u2022 Narrator likens Dermott\u2019s experience to \u201ca character in a shaggy dog story\u201d (<quote>He was beginning to feel like a character in a shaggy dog story.</quote>). Shaggy dog stories rely on elaborate, drawn-out comedy culminating in an anticlimax. This is a hallmark of humor, not of cynical satire.  \n b. Comic Build-Up and Anti-Climax:  \n    \u2022 The world waits \u201cwith breathless expectancy\u201d (<quote>It was the most universally awaited event of the ages.</quote>) only to receive a curt \u201cI must blast off\u201d and leave \u201cdog and cat\u201d specimens. The anticlimax is designed to elicit laughter at our own overblown excitement.\n\n2. Slapstick and Comic Miscommunication  \n a. Physical Comedy:  \n    \u2022 Dermott and Casey \u201cslipped and skidded desperately\u201d (<quote>slipped and skidded desperately across the field</quote>) in pursuit of the egg-shaped craft. Their comic ineptitude persists throughout.  \n    \u2022 Casey\u2019s shriek over the helmet (<quote>Begorra, I've been murthered!</quote>) and yanking it off in panic is pure slapstick.  \n b. Linguistic Jokes:  \n    \u2022 Kerit helmet forces Casey into \u201cthe corniest brogue\u201d (<quote>he has to pick up the corniest brogue west of Dublin</quote>)\u2014a deliberate comedic trope of fish-out-of-water.  \n    \u2022 Alien\u2019s repeated Irishisms (\u201cFaith,\u201d \u201cBegorra,\u201d \u201cCushlamachree\u201d) highlight the absurdity of interplanetary misunderstanding.\n\n3. Lighthearted Treatment of \u201cCosmic\u201d Elements  \n a. Absence of Threat:  \n    \u2022 Neither the alien nor humans ever display violence toward each other. Even when \u201cheld incommunicado,\u201d he is \u201cyawning,\u201d cursing, then \u201cwent back to sleep\u201d (<quote>He used some rather ripe Irish profanity\u2026 rolled over, and went back to sleep.</quote>). The tone remains playful, not ominous.  \n b. Pet Caricature:  \n    \u2022 His obsession with \u201cdog, cat and mouse\u201d (<quote>He had a kitten in his arms; a Scotty followed him.</quote>) is endearing, like a child with toys. He declines to take the quarantined horse (<quote>If I'd taken a crature\u2026 my name'd be nork</quote>), showing no malicious intent, only whimsical \u201ccraverse\u201d preferences.\n\n4. Tone of Characters\u2019 Reactions  \n a. Persistent Humor, Not Despair:  \n    \u2022 Even \u201cchaos\u201d and \u201clost faith\u201d in governments yield to relief when he departs. There is no mention of global collapse, only a re-opening of horse riding and a return to normalcy.  \n    \u2022 Delegates in the hall cheer wildly (<quote>cheering, stamping delegates</quote>), suggesting celebratory atmosphere, not dread. Their uproar continues as he oozes off-stage.  \n b. No Moralizing or Didacticism:  \n    \u2022 Cynical satire typically carries moral or political critique that lingers. Here, the author ends simply \u201cTHE END\u201d after the ship lifts off, implying we view the folly with affectionate amusement, not solemn reflection.\n\nRebuttal of \u201cCynical\u201d Position  \n1. Misreading of Irony as Cynicism  \n a. Alien\u2019s Identity Reveal:  \n    \u2022 Debater_B calls the \u201cspecimen collector\u201d twist ironic and cynical. In humor, mistaken identities and false expectations are classic farce devices. The revelation prompts comic relief: \u201cI must blast off immediately.\u201d  \n b. Galactic League Banter:  \n    \u2022 His surprise at Earth\u2019s exclusion (<quote>You don't mean to tell me\u2026?\u201d</quote>) and subsequent abandonment is played for laughs\u2014a tourist who forgot his hotel checkout, not a scathing indictment.\n\n2. Bureaucracy as Comedic Foil  \n a. Overblown Precautions:  \n    \u2022 Army and U.N. wrangling over \u201cjurisdiction\u201d and \u201cquarantine\u201d for weeks (<quote>We actually haven't had time to question him.</quote>) mock human fussiness. Comedy often spoofs red tape.  \n b. Yawns vs. Work:  \n    \u2022 The alien is asleep \u201csix days\u201d (<quote>He didn't awaken in the morning, nor the next.</quote>) while we scramble. This disparity highlights the humor in human impatience, not a misanthropic verdict.\n\n3. Absence of Negative Aftermath  \n a. No Earthwide Harm:  \n    \u2022 No mention of degraded society or violence after departure. Humanity simply loses a chance for cosmic guidance and resumes \u201chorse riding.\u201d There is no pessimistic tone of \u201cwe\u2019re doomed.\u201d  \n b. Return to Mundanity:  \n    \u2022 Final shot of the nag and the alien\u2019s wistful \u201cjust one thing\u201d gag (<quote>Jist one thing \u2026 were they pullin' my leg</quote>) closes on a chuckle, not a sobering message.\n\nConclusion  \nAll internal markers\u2014from self-declared \u201cshaggy dog story\u201d to repeated slapstick, anti-climactic reveal, lack of malevolence, and an ending designed to restore the status quo\u2014demonstrate the author\u2019s intent to amuse. The narrative invites readers to laugh at both naive humans and the bemused alien, fulfilling conventions of humorous science-fiction. The tone is clearly \u201cHumorous.\u201d",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Repeated Comic Misunderstandings  \n   a. Miscommunication gag: The alien\u2019s speech is unintelligible until he \u201cshared the kerit helmet with Tim\u201d and the patrolman \u201ccould talk\u201d but \u201cwith the corniest brogue west of Dublin\u201d (<quote>\"Begorra,\" he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\" He</quote>; <quote>Casey lifted it gingerly and placed it on his head. Not feeling any immediate effect, he</quote>). The humor derives from role-reversal \u2013 alien astonished by our machines \u2013 and from the patrolman\u2019s terrified reaction.  \n   b. Horse joke: The climactic pun that the alien thought \u201chorse\u201d might be a machine (<quote>\"Now what could that be after bein'?\"</quote>) and only hesitantly accepts \u201cwe ride on them\u201d leads to farce. His longing to smuggle a horse \u201cback to Carthis\u201d is absurd in context of interstellar travel.\n\n2. Lighthearted Portrayal of Officials  \n   a. Government panic is depicted as overblown whimsy: the alien is \u201cheld incommunicado\u201d for days only to \u201cawake\u201d and yawn, curse in Irish profanity, \u201croll over, and go back to sleep\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe used some rather ripe Irish profanity\u2026 and went back to sleep.\u201d</invalid_quote>). The contrast of cosmic import and petty bureaucracy produces comedic effect.  \n   b. The alien\u2019s obsession with his \u201cdog, cat and mouse\u201d as specimens (<quote> He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n</quote>) and insistence they \u201ccome with him\u201d is playful, not menacing.\n\n3. Final Irony as Comedy, Not Cynicism  \n   a. The false climax \u2013 the world awaits cosmic advice, only for the alien to depart, complaining of our \u201cwars,\u201d \u201cweapons,\u201d and our failure to invite Earth into the \u201cGalactic League\u201d (<quote> I  must blast off immediately.\"</quote>). This twist is comedic anti-climax, akin to a \u201cshaggy dog\u201d story (<quote> He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n</quote>), which by definition relies on humor through an elaborate build-up to a trivial ending.  \n   b. The story\u2019s very title and recurring imagery of yawns, dozing, and inaction (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe didn\u2019t awaken in the morning, nor the next. Six days later... turned over... went back to sleep.\u201d</invalid_quote>) lampoon the desperate expectations of humanity.\n\n4. Attack on \u201cCynical\u201d Interpretation  \n   a. Lack of Malice: Cynical tones imply a negative worldview or moral condemnation. Here, the alien is neither evil nor malevolent; he simply fails to understand our customs and leaves in comical bewilderment. There is no \u201cbitterness\u201d or \u201cpessimism,\u201d only bemused human reaction.  \n   b. The Earth characters never suffer catastrophe; there is no doom or disaster when he departs\u2014only relief and the ongoing farce of scientific speculation. Cynical endings usually emphasize despair or moral decay, not a wink at the audience\u2019s folly.  \n   c. The whimsical language (\u201cBegorra,\u201d \u201cFaith and,\u201d \u201cGorra manigan\u201d) and constant slapstick (\u201che skidded,\u201d \u201che shrieked,\u201d \u201cthe door slid open\u201d) align with humorous science-fiction conventions (e.g., comic misadventures), not with satire aimed at social or political critique.\n\nConclusion: All evidence\u2014from slapstick reactions, linguistic jokes, repeated anti-climaxes labeled a \u201cshaggy dog story,\u201d and the absence of tragic or bitter aftertaste\u2014demonstrates that the author intends a humorous, lighthearted tone. The misinterpretations and absurdities mock both human credulity and the clich\u00e9 of \u201cbenevolent alien savior,\u201d making the story a comedic study of expectation vs. reality, not a cynical indictment.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Cynical Tone (Debater_B)\n\n1. Fundamental Irony:  \n   a. \u201cSpecimen Collector\u201d Mistake  \n      \u2022 <quote>the envoy from the stars.</quote> turns out to be \u201conly a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo\u201d (<quote> meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens </quote>).  \n      \u2022 Cynical target: Human pretensions. They erect a \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d and mobilize governments for a \u201cbenevolent adviser\u201d who is merely a tourist (<quote>an' I must blast off immediately.\"</quote>).  \n   b. Galactic League Reference  \n      \u2022 Dameri Tass\u2019s astonishment that Earth has not been invited (<quote> You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Reflects cynical commentary on Earth\u2019s divides (<invalid_quote>\u201cNo wonder </invalid_quote> <quote> still have wars </quote> <invalid_quote> been invited to join\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\n2. Mockery of Human Institutions:  \n   a. Paralysis by Bureaucracy  \n      \u2022 Held \u201cincommunicado\u201d while White House, Pentagon, U.N. debate \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d delaying the meeting he cannot even speak to (<quote>\"We actually haven't had time to  question him.</quote>).  \n   b. Shepherds to Millionaires on \u201cZenith of expectation\u201d over \u201cmost important moment\u201d ends in disappointment.  \n      \u2022 Delegates cheer, then the alien declares \u201cI must blast off,\u201d and leaves them in \u201cchaos\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cOur world is in chaos. Many ... have lost faith.\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\n3. Alien\u2019s Reactions Highlight Human Folly:  \n   a. The kerit helmet forces Casey to speak \u201cthe corniest brogue\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cBegorra ... murthered!\u201d</invalid_quote>) \u2013 technology cannot overcome deep cultural ignorance.  \n   b. Horse Desire  \n      \u2022 Alien wants horse for \u201cquarantine\u201d world, symbolizing human wildness (<quote>\"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . </quote>).\n\n4. Consistent Cynicism vs. Humorous Misreading:  \n   a. Debater_A's \u201cHumorous tone\u201d ignores repeated themes of disappointment, chaos, wasted resources.  \n      \u2022 \u201cHumor\u201d would require benevolence; instead Earth governments panic, degrade, and delay.  \n   b. The ending: Alien\u2019s final remark on riding the horse (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2019Twould\u2019ve been my makin\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>) is not playful but desperate to abandon incompetent hosts.  \n   c. Laughter at human expense, not mutual amusement.\n\n5. Textual Evidence of Cynicism:  \n   a. Repeated bugged eyes and stares (<quote>they bugged quite as effectively</quote>) \u2013 humans\u2019 narrow-mindedness.  \n   b. Use of \u201cquarantine,\u201d \u201cweapons,\u201d \u201cstrange ideas\u201d \u2013 Earth is portrayed as backward.\n\nObjections to \u201cHumorous\u201d Tone:  \n1. Superficial Situational Comedy does not override the narrative\u2019s overall satirical critique of human pride and inefficiency.  \n2. Characters themselves do not laugh; they feel confusion, fear, \u201cchaos,\u201d and \u201clost faith.\u201d  \n3. The alien\u2019s impatience is genuine frustration, not comedic timing.\n\nConclusion  \n\u2013 The story\u2019s repeated juxtapositions of human grandiosity with the alien\u2019s impatience and final departure underline an ironic, satirical, and ultimately cynical view of humanity\u2019s inability to understand or earn its place in the larger cosmos. Therefore, the tone is Cynical, not simply Humorous.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Humorous\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed. Minor spelling and  typographical errors have been corrected without note. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the tone of the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Humorous\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Cynical\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Cynical\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Cynical Tone (Debater_B)\n\n1. Fundamental Irony:  \n   a. \u201cSpecimen Collector\u201d Mistake  \n      \u2022 <quote>the envoy from the stars.</quote> turns out to be \u201conly a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo\u201d (<quote> meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens </quote>).  \n      \u2022 Cynical target: Human pretensions. They erect a \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d and mobilize governments for a \u201cbenevolent adviser\u201d who is merely a tourist (<quote>an' I must blast off immediately.\"</quote>).  \n   b. Galactic League Reference  \n      \u2022 Dameri Tass\u2019s astonishment that Earth has not been invited (<quote> You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Reflects cynical commentary on Earth\u2019s divides (<invalid_quote>\u201cNo wonder </invalid_quote> <quote> still have wars </quote> <invalid_quote> been invited to join\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\n2. Mockery of Human Institutions:  \n   a. Paralysis by Bureaucracy  \n      \u2022 Held \u201cincommunicado\u201d while White House, Pentagon, U.N. debate \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d delaying the meeting he cannot even speak to (<quote>\"We actually haven't had time to  question him.</quote>).  \n   b. Shepherds to Millionaires on \u201cZenith of expectation\u201d over \u201cmost important moment\u201d ends in disappointment.  \n      \u2022 Delegates cheer, then the alien declares \u201cI must blast off,\u201d and leaves them in \u201cchaos\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cOur world is in chaos. Many ... have lost faith.\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\n3. Alien\u2019s Reactions Highlight Human Folly:  \n   a. The kerit helmet forces Casey to speak \u201cthe corniest brogue\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cBegorra ... murthered!\u201d</invalid_quote>) \u2013 technology cannot overcome deep cultural ignorance.  \n   b. Horse Desire  \n      \u2022 Alien wants horse for \u201cquarantine\u201d world, symbolizing human wildness (<quote>\"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . </quote>).\n\n4. Consistent Cynicism vs. Humorous Misreading:  \n   a. Debater_A's \u201cHumorous tone\u201d ignores repeated themes of disappointment, chaos, wasted resources.  \n      \u2022 \u201cHumor\u201d would require benevolence; instead Earth governments panic, degrade, and delay.  \n   b. The ending: Alien\u2019s final remark on riding the horse (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2019Twould\u2019ve been my makin\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>) is not playful but desperate to abandon incompetent hosts.  \n   c. Laughter at human expense, not mutual amusement.\n\n5. Textual Evidence of Cynicism:  \n   a. Repeated bugged eyes and stares (<quote>they bugged quite as effectively</quote>) \u2013 humans\u2019 narrow-mindedness.  \n   b. Use of \u201cquarantine,\u201d \u201cweapons,\u201d \u201cstrange ideas\u201d \u2013 Earth is portrayed as backward.\n\nObjections to \u201cHumorous\u201d Tone:  \n1. Superficial Situational Comedy does not override the narrative\u2019s overall satirical critique of human pride and inefficiency.  \n2. Characters themselves do not laugh; they feel confusion, fear, \u201cchaos,\u201d and \u201clost faith.\u201d  \n3. The alien\u2019s impatience is genuine frustration, not comedic timing.\n\nConclusion  \n\u2013 The story\u2019s repeated juxtapositions of human grandiosity with the alien\u2019s impatience and final departure underline an ironic, satirical, and ultimately cynical view of humanity\u2019s inability to understand or earn its place in the larger cosmos. Therefore, the tone is Cynical, not simply Humorous.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHumorous\u201d Tone:\n\n1. Repeated Comic Misunderstandings  \n   a. Miscommunication gag: The alien\u2019s speech is unintelligible until he \u201cshared the kerit helmet with Tim\u201d and the patrolman \u201ccould talk\u201d but \u201cwith the corniest brogue west of Dublin\u201d (<quote>\"Begorra,\" he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\" He</quote>; <quote>Casey lifted it gingerly and placed it on his head. Not feeling any immediate effect, he</quote>). The humor derives from role-reversal \u2013 alien astonished by our machines \u2013 and from the patrolman\u2019s terrified reaction.  \n   b. Horse joke: The climactic pun that the alien thought \u201chorse\u201d might be a machine (<quote>\"Now what could that be after bein'?\"</quote>) and only hesitantly accepts \u201cwe ride on them\u201d leads to farce. His longing to smuggle a horse \u201cback to Carthis\u201d is absurd in context of interstellar travel.\n\n2. Lighthearted Portrayal of Officials  \n   a. Government panic is depicted as overblown whimsy: the alien is \u201cheld incommunicado\u201d for days only to \u201cawake\u201d and yawn, curse in Irish profanity, \u201croll over, and go back to sleep\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe used some rather ripe Irish profanity\u2026 and went back to sleep.\u201d</invalid_quote>). The contrast of cosmic import and petty bureaucracy produces comedic effect.  \n   b. The alien\u2019s obsession with his \u201cdog, cat and mouse\u201d as specimens (<quote> He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n</quote>) and insistence they \u201ccome with him\u201d is playful, not menacing.\n\n3. Final Irony as Comedy, Not Cynicism  \n   a. The false climax \u2013 the world awaits cosmic advice, only for the alien to depart, complaining of our \u201cwars,\u201d \u201cweapons,\u201d and our failure to invite Earth into the \u201cGalactic League\u201d (<quote> I  must blast off immediately.\"</quote>). This twist is comedic anti-climax, akin to a \u201cshaggy dog\u201d story (<quote> He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n</quote>), which by definition relies on humor through an elaborate build-up to a trivial ending.  \n   b. The story\u2019s very title and recurring imagery of yawns, dozing, and inaction (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe didn\u2019t awaken in the morning, nor the next. Six days later... turned over... went back to sleep.\u201d</invalid_quote>) lampoon the desperate expectations of humanity.\n\n4. Attack on \u201cCynical\u201d Interpretation  \n   a. Lack of Malice: Cynical tones imply a negative worldview or moral condemnation. Here, the alien is neither evil nor malevolent; he simply fails to understand our customs and leaves in comical bewilderment. There is no \u201cbitterness\u201d or \u201cpessimism,\u201d only bemused human reaction.  \n   b. The Earth characters never suffer catastrophe; there is no doom or disaster when he departs\u2014only relief and the ongoing farce of scientific speculation. Cynical endings usually emphasize despair or moral decay, not a wink at the audience\u2019s folly.  \n   c. The whimsical language (\u201cBegorra,\u201d \u201cFaith and,\u201d \u201cGorra manigan\u201d) and constant slapstick (\u201che skidded,\u201d \u201che shrieked,\u201d \u201cthe door slid open\u201d) align with humorous science-fiction conventions (e.g., comic misadventures), not with satire aimed at social or political critique.\n\nConclusion: All evidence\u2014from slapstick reactions, linguistic jokes, repeated anti-climaxes labeled a \u201cshaggy dog story,\u201d and the absence of tragic or bitter aftertaste\u2014demonstrates that the author intends a humorous, lighthearted tone. The misinterpretations and absurdities mock both human credulity and the clich\u00e9 of \u201cbenevolent alien savior,\u201d making the story a comedic study of expectation vs. reality, not a cynical indictment.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Cynical\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Final Irony as Comedy, Not Cynicism  \n   a. The false climax \u2013 the world awaits cosmic advice, only for the alien to depart, complaining of our \u201cwars,\u201d \u201cweapons,\u201d and our failure to invite Earth into the \u201cGalactic League\u201d (<quote> I  must blast off immediately.\"</quote>). This twist is comedic anti-climax, akin to a \u201cshaggy dog\u201d story (<quote> He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n</quote>), which by definition relies on humor through an elaborate build-up to a trivial ending.  \n   b. The story\u2019s very title and recurring imagery of yawns, dozing, and inaction (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe didn\u2019t awaken in the morning, nor the next. Six days later... turned over... went back to sleep.\u201d</invalid_quote>) lampoon the desperate expectations of humanity.\n\n4. Attack on \u201cCynical\u201d Interpretation  \n   a. Lack of Malice: Cynical tones imply a negative worldview or moral condemnation. Here, the alien is neither evil nor malevolent; he simply fails to understand our customs and leaves in comical bewilderment. There is no \u201cbitterness\u201d or \u201cpessimism,\u201d only bemused human reaction.  \n   b. The Earth characters never suffer catastrophe; there is no doom or disaster when he departs\u2014only relief and the ongoing farce of scientific speculation. Cynical endings usually emphasize despair or moral decay, not a wink at the audience\u2019s folly.  \n   c. The whimsical language (\u201cBegorra,\u201d \u201cFaith and,\u201d \u201cGorra manigan\u201d) and constant slapstick (\u201che skidded,\u201d \u201che shrieked,\u201d \u201cthe door slid open\u201d) align with humorous science-fiction conventions (e.g., comic misadventures), not with satire aimed at social or political critique.\n\nConclusion: All evidence\u2014from slapstick reactions, linguistic jokes, repeated anti-climaxes labeled a \u201cshaggy dog story,\u201d and the absence of tragic or bitter aftertaste\u2014demonstrates that the author intends a humorous, lighthearted tone. The misinterpretations and absurdities mock both human credulity and the clich\u00e9 of \u201cbenevolent alien savior,\u201d making the story a comedic study of expectation vs. reality, not a cynical indictment.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Cynical Tone (Debater_B)\n\n1. Fundamental Irony:  \n   a. \u201cSpecimen Collector\u201d Mistake  \n      \u2022 <quote>the envoy from the stars.</quote> turns out to be \u201conly a second-rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo\u201d (<quote> meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens </quote>).  \n      \u2022 Cynical target: Human pretensions. They erect a \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d and mobilize governments for a \u201cbenevolent adviser\u201d who is merely a tourist (<quote>an' I must blast off immediately.\"</quote>).  \n   b. Galactic League Reference  \n      \u2022 Dameri Tass\u2019s astonishment that Earth has not been invited (<quote> You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Reflects cynical commentary on Earth\u2019s divides (<invalid_quote>\u201cNo wonder </invalid_quote> <quote> still have wars </quote> <invalid_quote> been invited to join\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\n2. Mockery of Human Institutions:  \n   a. Paralysis by Bureaucracy  \n      \u2022 Held \u201cincommunicado\u201d while White House, Pentagon, U.N. debate \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d delaying the meeting he cannot even speak to (<quote>\"We actually haven't had time to  question him.</quote>).  \n   b. Shepherds to Millionaires on \u201cZenith of expectation\u201d over \u201cmost important moment\u201d ends in disappointment.  \n      \u2022 Delegates cheer, then the alien declares \u201cI must blast off,\u201d and leaves them in \u201cchaos\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cOur world is in chaos. Many ... have lost faith.\u201d</invalid_quote>).\n\n3. Alien\u2019s Reactions Highlight Human Folly:  \n   a. The kerit helmet forces Casey to speak \u201cthe corniest brogue\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cBegorra ... murthered!\u201d</invalid_quote>) \u2013 technology cannot overcome deep cultural ignorance.  \n   b. Horse Desire  \n      \u2022 Alien wants horse for \u201cquarantine\u201d world, symbolizing human wildness (<quote>\"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . </quote>).\n\n4. Consistent Cynicism vs. Humorous Misreading:  \n   a. Debater_A's \u201cHumorous tone\u201d ignores repeated themes of disappointment, chaos, wasted resources.  \n      \u2022 \u201cHumor\u201d would require benevolence; instead Earth governments panic, degrade, and delay.  \n   b. The ending: Alien\u2019s final remark on riding the horse (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2019Twould\u2019ve been my makin\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>) is not playful but desperate to abandon incompetent hosts.  \n   c. Laughter at human expense, not mutual amusement.\n\n5. Textual Evidence of Cynicism:  \n   a. Repeated bugged eyes and stares (<quote>they bugged quite as effectively</quote>) \u2013 humans\u2019 narrow-mindedness.  \n   b. Use of \u201cquarantine,\u201d \u201cweapons,\u201d \u201cstrange ideas\u201d \u2013 Earth is portrayed as backward.\n\nObjections to \u201cHumorous\u201d Tone:  \n1. Superficial Situational Comedy does not override the narrative\u2019s overall satirical critique of human pride and inefficiency.  \n2. Characters themselves do not laugh; they feel confusion, fear, \u201cchaos,\u201d and \u201clost faith.\u201d  \n3. The alien\u2019s impatience is genuine frustration, not comedic timing.\n\nConclusion  \n\u2013 The story\u2019s repeated juxtapositions of human grandiosity with the alien\u2019s impatience and final departure underline an ironic, satirical, and ultimately cynical view of humanity\u2019s inability to understand or earn its place in the larger cosmos. Therefore, the tone is Cynical, not simply Humorous.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHumorous\u201d Tone (Rebuttal and Reinforcement)\n\n1. Emphasis on \u201cShaggy Dog Story\u201d Structure  \n a. Self-referential Label:  \n    \u2022 Narrator likens Dermott\u2019s experience to \u201ca character in a shaggy dog story\u201d (<quote>He was beginning to feel like a character in a shaggy dog story.</quote>). Shaggy dog stories rely on elaborate, drawn-out comedy culminating in an anticlimax. This is a hallmark of humor, not of cynical satire.  \n b. Comic Build-Up and Anti-Climax:  \n    \u2022 The world waits \u201cwith breathless expectancy\u201d (<quote>It was the most universally awaited event of the ages.</quote>) only to receive a curt \u201cI must blast off\u201d and leave \u201cdog and cat\u201d specimens. The anticlimax is designed to elicit laughter at our own overblown excitement.\n\n2. Slapstick and Comic Miscommunication  \n a. Physical Comedy:  \n    \u2022 Dermott and Casey \u201cslipped and skidded desperately\u201d (<quote>slipped and skidded desperately across the field</quote>) in pursuit of the egg-shaped craft. Their comic ineptitude persists throughout.  \n    \u2022 Casey\u2019s shriek over the helmet (<invalid_quote>Begorra, I've been murthered!</invalid_quote>) and yanking it off in panic is pure slapstick.  \n b. Linguistic Jokes:  \n    \u2022 Kerit helmet forces Casey into \u201cthe corniest brogue\u201d (<quote>he has to pick up the corniest brogue west of Dublin</quote>)\u2014a deliberate comedic trope of fish-out-of-water.  \n    \u2022 Alien\u2019s repeated Irishisms (\u201cFaith,\u201d \u201cBegorra,\u201d \u201cCushlamachree\u201d) highlight the absurdity of interplanetary misunderstanding.\n\n3. Lighthearted Treatment of \u201cCosmic\u201d Elements  \n a. Absence of Threat:  \n    \u2022 Neither the alien nor humans ever display violence toward each other. Even when \u201cheld incommunicado,\u201d he is \u201cyawning,\u201d cursing, then \u201cwent back to sleep\u201d (<quote>some rather ripe Irish profanity on us, rolled over, and went back to sleep.\"</quote>). The tone remains playful, not ominous.  \n b. Pet Caricature:  \n    \u2022 His obsession with \u201cdog, cat and mouse\u201d (<quote>He had a kitten in his arms; a Scotty followed him.</quote>) is endearing, like a child with toys. He declines to take the quarantined horse (<invalid_quote>If I'd taken a crature\u2026 my name'd be nork</invalid_quote>), showing no malicious intent, only whimsical \u201ccraverse\u201d preferences.\n\n4. Tone of Characters\u2019 Reactions  \n a. Persistent Humor, Not Despair:  \n    \u2022 Even \u201cchaos\u201d and \u201clost faith\u201d in governments yield to relief when he departs. There is no mention of global collapse, only a re-opening of horse riding and a return to normalcy.  \n    \u2022 Delegates in the hall cheer wildly (<quote>cheering, stamping delegates</quote>), suggesting celebratory atmosphere, not dread. Their uproar continues as he oozes off-stage.  \n b. No Moralizing or Didacticism:  \n    \u2022 Cynical satire typically carries moral or political critique that lingers. Here, the author ends simply \u201cTHE END\u201d after the ship lifts off, implying we view the folly with affectionate amusement, not solemn reflection.\n\nRebuttal of \u201cCynical\u201d Position  \n1. Misreading of Irony as Cynicism  \n a. Alien\u2019s Identity Reveal:  \n    \u2022 Debater_B calls the \u201cspecimen collector\u201d twist ironic and cynical. In humor, mistaken identities and false expectations are classic farce devices. The revelation prompts comic relief: \u201cI must blast off immediately.\u201d  \n b. Galactic League Banter:  \n    \u2022 His surprise at Earth\u2019s exclusion (<quote>You don't mean to tell me th</quote>) and subsequent abandonment is played for laughs\u2014a tourist who forgot his hotel checkout, not a scathing indictment.\n\n2. Bureaucracy as Comedic Foil  \n a. Overblown Precautions:  \n    \u2022 Army and U.N. wrangling over \u201cjurisdiction\u201d and \u201cquarantine\u201d for weeks (<quote>We actually haven't had time to question him.</quote>) mock human fussiness. Comedy often spoofs red tape.  \n b. Yawns vs. Work:  \n    \u2022 The alien is asleep \u201csix days\u201d (<quote>He didn't awaken in the morning, nor the next.</quote>) while we scramble. This disparity highlights the humor in human impatience, not a misanthropic verdict.\n\n3. Absence of Negative Aftermath  \n a. No Earthwide Harm:  \n    \u2022 No mention of degraded society or violence after departure. Humanity simply loses a chance for cosmic guidance and resumes \u201chorse riding.\u201d There is no pessimistic tone of \u201cwe\u2019re doomed.\u201d  \n b. Return to Mundanity:  \n    \u2022 Final shot of the nag and the alien\u2019s wistful \u201cjust one thing\u201d gag (<invalid_quote>Jist one thing \u2026 were they pullin' my leg</invalid_quote>) closes on a chuckle, not a sobering message.\n\nConclusion  \nAll internal markers\u2014from self-declared \u201cshaggy dog story\u201d to repeated slapstick, anti-climactic reveal, lack of malevolence, and an ending designed to restore the status quo\u2014demonstrate the author\u2019s intent to amuse. The narrative invites readers to laugh at both naive humans and the bemused alien, fulfilling conventions of humorous science-fiction. The tone is clearly \u201cHumorous.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for a Cynical Tone  \n\n1. Central Irony Undermines Human Vanity  \n   a. \u201cEnvoy\u201d Revealed as Tourist  \n      \u2022 The world \u201cat a zenith of expectation\u201d (<quote> most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n</quote>) deploys all branches of government yet cannot even wake or understand him for six days (<quote>\"We actually haven't had time to  question him. </quote>). When he finally speaks, he reveals himself merely as a \u201csecond\u2010rate collector of specimens for the Carthis zoo\u201d (<quote> meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens </quote>) and immediately \u201cmust blast off\u201d (<quote> I  must blast off immediately.\"</quote>).  \n      \u2022 Cynical target: human hubris. The text stresses \u201cvolcano of editorial heat\u201d and \u201cchaos\u201d (<quote> Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. </quote>)\u2014not joyful bewilderment.  \n\n   b. Galactic League Mockery  \n      \u2022 The alien\u2019s astonishment that Earth is not \u201ca member of the Galactic League\u201d (<quote> You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"</quote>) underscores our backwardness. His departure sally  (<quote>sally </quote>) after condemning wars and \u201cweapons\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cNo wonder it is ye haven't been invited... You probably still have wars on this benighted world.\u201d</invalid_quote>) leaves humanity uninvited and ashamed.\n\n2. Repeated Theme of Disappointment, Not Laughter  \n   a. \u201cShaggy Dog Story\u201d Reference  \n      \u2022 The narrator explicitly compares Dermott to someone in \u201ca shaggy dog story\u201d (<quote> He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n</quote>). By definition, a shaggy dog story relies on anticlimax and frustration\u2014highlighting the absence of satisfaction.  \n   b. Characters\u2019 Reactions Are Fear and Bewilderment  \n      \u2022 Dermott and Casey \u201cbug their eyes,\u201d \u201cgroan,\u201d and \u201cshriek\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cBegorra, I've been murthered!\u201d</invalid_quote>), not laugh. Officials debate jurisdiction and try to \u201chumor\u201d him (<invalid_quote>\u201cOrders it is ... Humor him.\u201d</invalid_quote>)\u2014all signs of apprehension and distrust.  \n   c. \u201cLost Faith\u201d and Relief at Departure  \n      \u2022 \u201cOur world is in chaos. Many of us have lost faith\u201d (<quote> lost faith. </quote>)\u2014a despairing note. The ending implies relief rather than any celebratory or comic outcome when he finally leaves.\n\n3. Humorous Elements Serve Satire, Not Comedy for Its Own Sake  \n   a. Kerit Helmet Brogue  \n      \u2022 The technology forces Casey into \u201cthe corniest brogue west of Dublin\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cBegorra ... murthered!\u201d</invalid_quote>). This mockery of both alien technology and human parochialism shows our linguistic and cultural ignorance rather than generate mutual humor.  \n   b. Animal Specimens as Symbols of Quarantine  \n      \u2022 Alien insists on his \u201cdog, cat and mouse\u201d and longs for a \u201chorse\u201d (<quote>\"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . </quote>). His final desire to \u201cride\u201d a horse (<quote> were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"</quote>) underscores Earth\u2019s primitiveness\u2014he cannot find any worthy cultural or intellectual \u201cspecimen.\u201d\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cHumorous\u201d Interpretation Fails to Account For:  \n   a. Persistent Anxiety and Bureaucratic Paralysis  \n      \u2022 Days of incommunicado hold show fear and suspicion, not jocular amusement.  \n   b. Absence of a Comic Resolution  \n      \u2022 No punchline or reconciliation; the audience is left ashamed and rejected. The \u201cmost important moment\u201d wastes away in \u201csleep\u201d and \u201cprofanity\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe used some rather ripe Irish profanity... and went back to sleep.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   c. Tone Markers of Satire, Not Slapstick  \n      \u2022 Repeated references to \u201cquarantine,\u201d \u201cweapons,\u201d \u201cstrange ideas,\u201d and \u201cjurisdiction\u201d are satirical criticisms of human divisions and petty rivalries, not playful absurdity.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe story\u2019s elaborate setup, international \u201cvolcano of editorial heat,\u201d and ultimate anticlimax\u2014culminating in the alien\u2019s disgust and departure\u2014expose human pretension and backwardness. The repeated motifs of \u201clost faith,\u201d \u201cchaos,\u201d and \u201cshaggy dog story\u201d purposefully frustrate expectations. The reader is meant to reflect on humanity\u2019s unworthiness and folly, not merely to be amused. Thus the tone is Cynical.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
