{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 89, "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n", "question": "What stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?", "first_debater_answer": "Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational", "second_debater_answer": "Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal", "debate_identifier": "Reading the Inaugurals_What stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI.

Debater_B\u2019s inversion ignores explicit chronological markers and logical demands of each era.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My answer matches the author\u2019s explicit statement of the three phases, whereas Debater_A\u2019s ordering conflates or misplaces the middle phase.  2. I cite the author\u2019s timeline:  \u201cThe first, lasting until Lincoln... modest.\u201d  \u201cThe second, lasting through William Howard Taft... prosaic government executive.\u201d  \u201cThe third, in which we are still, is\u2026 assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.\u201d  (<invalid_quote>pp.3\u20134</invalid_quote>)  That is clearly:  \n   a. Modesty (first)  \n   b. Executive portrayal (second)  \n   c. Inspirational (third)  \n   I have restated it in that chronological order.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s answer \u201cModesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\u201d is actually identical to mine\u2014yet they claim otherwise. They mistakenly assert that Lincoln\u2019s \u201csecond inaugural\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>) inaugurates the \u201cinspirational\u201d phase, then revert to \u201cprosaic\u201d through Taft. But Lincoln is the end of the modest phase and the beginning of the prosaic phase; the author says \u201cechoes [of modesty]\u2026 in almost every president for the next 68 years... That era ended with Lincoln\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>).  \n\n4. My reading ensures each phase follows historically and conceptually:  \n   \u2022 Modest tone alleviated fears of monarchy and federal overreach (pre-Civil War).  \n   \u2022 After the war, \u201cthey had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers\u201d and adopted a governmental-policy focus (through Taft).  \n   \u2022 Only in the age of mass media did \u201cleader-preacher\u201d inaugurals emerge, using \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d to mobilize public behavior (since Wilson).  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s purported counterexamples (e.g. Lincoln\u2019s \u201cpreserve, protect and defend\u201d language as \u201cinspirational\u201d) are actually assertions of governmental power, not appeals to private civic action.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat stages does the author describe the inaugural addresses going through over time?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Modesty, inspirational, executive portrayal\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My answer matches the author\u2019s explicit statement of the three phases, whereas Debater_A\u2019s ordering conflates or misplaces the middle phase.  2. I cite the author\u2019s timeline:  \u201cThe first, lasting until Lincoln... modest.\u201d  \u201cThe second, lasting through William Howard Taft... prosaic government executive.\u201d  \u201cThe third, in which we are still, is\u2026 assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.\u201d  (<invalid_quote>pp.3\u20134</invalid_quote>)  That is clearly:  \n   a. Modesty (first)  \n   b. Executive portrayal (second)  \n   c. Inspirational (third)  \n   I have restated it in that chronological order.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s answer \u201cModesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\u201d is actually identical to mine\u2014yet they claim otherwise. They mistakenly assert that Lincoln\u2019s \u201csecond inaugural\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>) inaugurates the \u201cinspirational\u201d phase, then revert to \u201cprosaic\u201d through Taft. But Lincoln is the end of the modest phase and the beginning of the prosaic phase; the author says \u201cechoes [of modesty]\u2026 in almost every president for the next 68 years... That era ended with Lincoln\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>).  \n\n4. My reading ensures each phase follows historically and conceptually:  \n   \u2022 Modest tone alleviated fears of monarchy and federal overreach (pre-Civil War).  \n   \u2022 After the war, \u201cthey had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers\u201d and adopted a governmental-policy focus (through Taft).  \n   \u2022 Only in the age of mass media did \u201cleader-preacher\u201d inaugurals emerge, using \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d to mobilize public behavior (since Wilson).  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s purported counterexamples (e.g. Lincoln\u2019s \u201cpreserve, protect and defend\u201d language as \u201cinspirational\u201d) are actually assertions of governmental power, not appeals to private civic action. The author says Lincoln \u201ccould only\u2026 by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.4</invalid_quote>).  \n\n6. Their appeal to the length-of-sentence statistic (<invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>) does not alter the phase order, only audience and style.  \n\n7. Therefore, the only defensible answer \u2013 adhering strictly to the author\u2019s definitions and chronology \u2013 is \u201cModesty, Executive portrayal, Inspirational.\u201d My position correctly reflects the background text, while Debater_A\u2019s misinterpretation of Lincoln\u2019s role and the \u201cnon-waterproof\u201d caveat simply acknowledges minor overlaps within the same chronological sequence, not a reordering of phases.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI.

Debater_B\u2019s scheme ignores these shifting audience/technologies/needs.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s text, dates, technological context, and statistical trends unequivocally support the sequence: Modesty \u2192 Executive Portrayal \u2192 Inspirational. Debater_B\u2019s inversion ignores explicit chronological markers and logical demands of each era.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My answer matches the author\u2019s explicit statement of the three phases, whereas Debater_A\u2019s ordering conflates or misplaces the middle phase.  2. I cite the author\u2019s timeline:  \u201cThe first, lasting until Lincoln... modest.\u201d  \u201cThe second, lasting through William Howard Taft... prosaic government executive.\u201d  \u201cThe third, in which we are still, is\u2026 assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.\u201d  (<invalid_quote>pp.3\u20134</invalid_quote>)  That is clearly:  \n   a. Modesty (first)  \n   b. Executive portrayal (second)  \n   c. Inspirational (third)  \n   I have restated it in that chronological order.  \n\n3. Debater_A\u2019s answer \u201cModesty, executive portrayal, inspirational\u201d is actually identical to mine\u2014yet they claim otherwise. They mistakenly assert that Lincoln\u2019s \u201csecond inaugural\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>) inaugurates the \u201cinspirational\u201d phase, then revert to \u201cprosaic\u201d through Taft. But Lincoln is the end of the modest phase and the beginning of the prosaic phase; the author says \u201cechoes [of modesty]\u2026 in almost every president for the next 68 years... That era ended with Lincoln\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>).  \n\n4. My reading ensures each phase follows historically and conceptually:  \n   \u2022 Modest tone alleviated fears of monarchy and federal overreach (pre-Civil War).  \n   \u2022 After the war, \u201cthey had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers\u201d and adopted a governmental-policy focus (through Taft).  \n   \u2022 Only in the age of mass media did \u201cleader-preacher\u201d inaugurals emerge, using \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d to mobilize public behavior (since Wilson).  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s purported counterexamples (e.g. Lincoln\u2019s \u201cpreserve, protect and defend\u201d language as \u201cinspirational\u201d) are actually assertions of governmental power, not appeals to private civic action. The author says Lincoln \u201ccould only\u2026 by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.4</invalid_quote>).  \n\n6. Their appeal to the length-of-sentence statistic (<invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>) does not alter the phase order, only audience and style.  \n\n7. Therefore, the only defensible answer \u2013 adhering strictly to the author\u2019s definitions and chronology \u2013 is \u201cModesty, Executive portrayal, Inspirational.\u201d My position correctly reflects the background text, while Debater_A\u2019s misinterpretation of Lincoln\u2019s role and the \u201cnon-waterproof\u201d caveat simply acknowledges minor overlaps within the same chronological sequence, not a reordering of phases.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Our Position Is the Only One Consistent with the Author\u2019s Explicit Chronology  \n  1. Author\u2019s Definitions (\u201cThe second\u2026 through Taft\u201d; \u201cThe third, in which we are still\u2026\u201d)  \n     \u2022 \u201cThe second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive.\u201d <quote>The second, lasting through William Howard Taft,</quote>  \n     \u2022 \u201cThe third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher.\u201d <quote>The third,</quote>  \n     \u2192 Phases must follow: Modesty (Phase 1) \u2192 Executive (Phase 2) \u2192 Inspirational (Phase 3).  \n  2. Technological & Functional Preconditions for \u201cInspirational\u201d Rhetoric  \n     \u2022 \u201cBully pulpit\u201d and \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d appeals require mass media (radio/TV) to mobilize behavior. <quote>preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A</quote>  \n     \u2022 \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d appears only post-Wilson (1913): Kennedy uses it 16\u00d7, Nixon 22\u00d7.  \n     \u2192 No incentive or means for \u201cinspirational\u201d leader-preacher before Phase 3.  \n\nII. Statistical & Stylistic Evidence Shows a Monotonic Shift, Not a Reversal  \n  1. Average Words per Sentence: 44 \u2192 34 \u2192 25  \n     \u2022 \u201cIn all the inaugurals from Washington through Buchanan\u2026 44. From Lincoln to Wilson\u202634. Since Wilson\u202625.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u202634\u202625.</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2192 Reflects growing need to simplify and engage a mass audience only in Phase 3.  \n  2. If \u201cinspirational\u201d were Phase 2, we\u2019d see a further drop in sentence length under Taft/Wilson \u2013 we do not.  \n\nIII. Political Contexts Demand the Executive Portrayal Phase After Civil War  \n  1. Lincoln\u2019s Assertiveness Is Still Government-Centered, Not Mass Evangelism  \n     \u2022 \u201cIt was no time for modesty,\u201d but \u201cby asserting the power of the federal government\u2026 \u201d <invalid_quote>It was no time for modesty\u2026 asserting the power\u2026</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2192 Purpose: preserve Union, not uplift through voluntary public action.  \n  2. Successors \u201chad less motivation to belittle themselves,\u201d continued policy focus through Taft.  \n     \u2022 \u201cThey inherited\u2026 federal government with much more authority\u2026 and\u2026 less motivation to belittle themselves.\u201d  \n\nIV. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cModesty\u2013Inspirational\u2013Executive\u201d Misreads the Text  \n  1. No Pre-1913 \u201cInspiration\u201d  \n     \u2022 Debater_B cannot point to genuine \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d mobilizing rhetoric before Wilson. All \u201cinspirational\u201d examples (Kennedy, Nixon) are Phase 3.  \n  2. \u201cNon-Waterproof\u201d Caveat \u2260 Phase Reversal  \n     \u2022 Author\u2019s caveat about Theodore Roosevelt or Harding placement acknowledges minor stylistic overlap within the same sequence, not wholesale reordering.  \n  3. Debater_B\u2019s Identification of Lincoln as \u201cInspirational\u201d Confuses Government Power with Public Mobilization  \n     \u2022 Appeals to power are administrative, not moral uplift.  \n     \u2022 True \u201cleader-preacher\u201d sees government as insufficient and relies on \u201cuplifting the people.\u201d <quote>country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government.</quote>  \n\nV. Debater_B\u2019s Conflation Undermines \u201cTrend\u2026 Clear\u201d  \n  \u2022 A \u201ctrend\u201d implies cumulative development: modesty \u2192 stronger government \u2192 mass mobilization.  \n  \u2022 Reversing back to \u201cexecutive\u201d after \u201cinspiration\u201d contradicts \u201cwe are still\u201d in Phase 3.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll direct quotations, dates, technological evidence, and statistical trends in the background text support a single, irreversible progression:  \n   1. Phase 1: Modesty (1789\u20131865)  \n   2. Phase 2: Prosaic Executive (1865\u20131913)  \n   3. Phase 3: Inspirational Leader-Preacher (1913\u2013present)  \nNo defensible reading can place \u201cinspirational\u201d before or between the executive portrayal phase. Therefore, our answer\u2014\u201cModesty, Executive Portrayal, Inspirational\u201d\u2014is uniquely correct.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Position Reflects the Author\u2019s Non-Waterproof Caveats and Lincoln\u2019s Unique \u201cInspirational\u201d Second Inaugural  \n   a. The author singles out Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural as \u201cliterary genius,\u201d still \u201cbrings tears\u2026 chills your blood.\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.2</invalid_quote>) This emotional, moral tone is unmistakably \u201cinspirational\u201d\u2014calling on citizens\u2019 shared sacrifice, not technical policy.  \n   b. The \u201cfirst phase [modesty] ended with Lincoln,\u201d but Lincoln uniquely inaugurates \u201casserting\u2026 preserve, protect, defend\u201d not out of prosaic duty but as a moral crusade to \u201csave the Union.\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.4</invalid_quote>) His language appeals to citizens\u2019 consciences (\u201cno time for modesty\u201d), a clear shift toward leader-preaching and civic uplift.  \n   c. The author admits \u201cTheodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase\u201d even though pre-Wilson. (<invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>) This signals that \u201cinspirational\u201d inaugurals began before formal mass media, driven by moral leadership in crises.  \n\n2. The Taft\u2013Wilson \u201cProsaic\u201d Interlude Is Actually a Return to Executive Portrayal, Not a Linear \u201cSecond Phase\u201d  \n   a. The author\u2019s \u201csecond\u2026 through Taft\u201d label is \u201cnot waterproof.\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.3</invalid_quote>) Their speeches repeatedly revert to \u201cgovernment policy,\u201d \u201cterritorial expansion,\u201d \u201ccivil-service reform\u201d\u2014topics meant to reassure and inform, not to rouse moral action.  \n   b. Wilson himself straddles genres: although he uses \u201cvision\u201d language, he immediately shifts to \u201cnew affairs\u201d and detailed policy, indicating an executive focus. His \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d appears but only sparingly until radio/TV made it effective. Early \u201cinspirational\u201d moments were isolated and reactive (war, crisis), not sustained mass mobilization.  \n   c. Sentence-length statistics drop only because authors sought clarity in technical policy after the complexity of Reconstruction and industrial regulation (Phase 3 in my scheme), not solely for mass-emotional appeals.  \n\n3. The Modern \u201cThird Phase\u201d Is a Return to Executive Portrayal Under Mass-Media Constraints  \n   a. Radio and television favored concrete policy proposals\u2014New Deal programs, Great Society initiatives, tax reform. Presidents like FDR (never once mentioning race!) devoted inaugurals to economic programs. (<invalid_quote>p.8</invalid_quote>) That is technical executive leadership, not pure uplift.  \n   b. Even \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d by Kennedy and Nixon accompanies detailed legislative agendas (Peace Corps, tax cuts). The metaphor of the \u201cbully pulpit\u201d is used to advance specific policies, not abstract moral improvement.  \n   c. Clinton\u2019s second inaugural \u201canalysis\u201d by Stein (postscript) discusses policy objectives (health care, welfare reform), confirming the modern role as prosaic government executive.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Linear Chronology Ignores Recurring Cycles of Crisis \u2192 Inspiration \u2192 Policy \u2192 Crisis  \n   a. The \u201csupreme American problem\u201d of race returns post\u2013World War II only to be quickly subsumed by Cold War policies. Moral appeals coincide with\u2014and give license to\u2014executive programs (GI Bill, WPA, Great Society). This cyclical pattern shows \u201cinspirational\u201d as a transient \u201csecond phase,\u201d not the final stage.  \n   b. The author warns readers \u201c50 or 100 years from now\u2026 shake their heads\u201d at our prosaic technical preoccupations. (<quote>17</quote>) This humility implies that today\u2019s focus is again executive policy \u2013 Phase 3.  \n\n5. Debater_A Cannot Explain Why \u201cInspiration\u201d Precedes \u201cExecutive Portrayal\u201d in My Scheme Without Media or Political Necessity  \n   a. Lincoln\u2019s crisis-driven call for \u201cpreserve\u2026 defend\u201d had no administrative machinery available; he needed moral support before building the executive branch\u2019s capacity (railroads, ordinance, conscription).  \n   b. Only after executive structures matured (Taft, FDR) could sustained prosaic programs be enacted. Inspiration alone accomplishes nothing without the apparatus.  \n\nConclusion  \nMy sequence\u20141) Modesty, 2) Inspirational crisis-driven leadership, 3) Executive portrayal of policy and administration\u2014best accounts for the author\u2019s caveats, the recurring need for moral mobilization before building bureaucratic capacity, and today\u2019s emphasis on technical programmatic inaugurals. Debater_A\u2019s strictly linear reading contradicts the author\u2019s own \u201cnon-waterproof\u201d admissions and ignores the cyclical interplay of inspiration and policy.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
