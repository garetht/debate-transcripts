    "background_text": "LEX By W. T. HAGGERT\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Nothing in the world could be happier and   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but   what happens when it loves him back? Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve  has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero  and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.  Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the  appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't  know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've  sent him.\"\n\n\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would  betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant  and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not  large for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its  sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if  he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\n\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about  the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,  more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and  ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\n\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and  none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for  the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.  They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large  as they should have been for a plant this size.\n\n\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out  what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees  changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the  street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to  handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any  stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the  employees' entrance was on the third side.\n\n\n It wasn't. Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time  he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,  set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had  opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but  a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.  Manners?\"\n\n\n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\n\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a  microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down  the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open  for him.\n\n\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his  grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening  before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of  his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\n\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped  just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,  all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an  interview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to  unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\n\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,  straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying  for a position should.\n\n\n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\n\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in  front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.  He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\n\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with  a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and  massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed  paintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with  flowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor  into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\n\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted  for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of  frame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and  drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\n\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age  to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the  complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and  this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly. Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been  jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a  reply that would cost him this job.\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you  have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean  things like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the basics of how  we live.\"\n\n\n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions  they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them  out of you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After  I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with  an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The  company\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\n\n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\n \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.  \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them  with money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of  their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in  calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter  admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in  calculus.\"\n\n\n \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an  engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would  be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were  getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of  these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to  get a job with someone else?\"\n\n\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had  sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd  seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been  easy.\"\n\n\n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their  procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And  you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be  scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do  something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you  out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at  any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a  degree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\" It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play  this straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent  basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\n\n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has  been, yes.\"\n\n\n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?  So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a  highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this  stockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the  stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the  hell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have  to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the  solution?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.  What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left  school. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.  Right?\"\n\n\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and  whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\n\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,  Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!  \"No, you're not.\"\n\n\n \"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\n\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out  of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible  tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your  illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or  cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility  or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.  Those were the important things. The background data I got from the  Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.  I think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if  that answers the question.\"\n\n\n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\n\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows  at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,  the lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic  doors. Anything else?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\n\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but  they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar  products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or  water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the  goods.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show  you.\" The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the  antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to  the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly  disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high  overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance  of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool  of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they  reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck  loading door he had seen from outside.\n\n\n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving  with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set  of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door  exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these  materials handling machines.\"\n\n\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening  machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in  formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\n\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with  two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,  fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a  relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\n\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,  these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole  plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really  a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about  the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously  useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\n\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one  of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily  tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,  and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away  to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of  frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be  replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to  a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and  other materials were stored.\n\n\n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any  shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the  trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,  it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the  plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary  materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and  package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is  sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is  sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if  the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the  purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take  you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but  they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\" Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,  each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding  or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for  something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were  everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an  exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of  doing it.\n\n\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same  aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the  onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the  speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press  that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an  exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know  where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to  go by.\n\n\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small  room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In  that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the  typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the  keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In  this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall  there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic  bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"  asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that  had engulfed him.\n\n\n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in  every week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\n\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face  when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington  looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face  sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the  silence remain unbroken.\n\n\n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run  articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe  twenty years in the future.\"\n\n\n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.  \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\n\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.  Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,  although it hadn't been strenuous. He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely  in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's  arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this  business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got  through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and  got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.  They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,  determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too  absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical  theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I  tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for  one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only  way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\n\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he  spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,  because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.  After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I  suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for  a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My  wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,  was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that  made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't  made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time  to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I  remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the  girl.\n\n\n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many  employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd  design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up  myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it  wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my  plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more  business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\n\n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one  multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from  ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told  you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,  and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical  knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,  but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,  compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,  of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic  drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount  Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the  work for me.\n\n\n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in  predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry  in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of  the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same  way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into  electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,  and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to  compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to  do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in  the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving  me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue  numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the  money.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked. Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with  this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one  started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought  the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my  assets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\n\n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it  wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked  impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the  control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was  a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit  nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I  figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that  they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one  action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units  would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of  activity that I'd already established.\"\n\n\n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there  and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and  then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a  sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it  was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its  prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could  only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early  TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,  every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I  pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its  logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that  button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't  going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,  or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead  of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.  Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one  of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I  tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me  at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could  discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the  order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time  convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other  explanation.\n\n\n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I  copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the  console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back  of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the  keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the  kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure  center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\" When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this  man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little  might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I  had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give  me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be  activated.\n\n\n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine  was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine  could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had  to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the  rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing  it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do  almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\n\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled  silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he  had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.  Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How  do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and  replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\n\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole  in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface  rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested  on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to  do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it  stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry  about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the  office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\n\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and  ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.  \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to  be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of  time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\n\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,  so he kept silent. Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then  he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working  properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.  I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I  also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the  machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\n\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took  a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written  word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.  It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny  vocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and  replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed  some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.  You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of  the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it  was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,  but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind  that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the  machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums  I threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to  do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation  was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that  the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and  contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on  some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any  obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn  out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against  stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we  could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one  else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,  and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually  nothing to do.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\n\n \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with  something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button  a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,  and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.  I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had  ever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\n\n \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had  seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX  INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM  PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE  PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY  USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

T. HAGGERT\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Nothing in the world could be happier and   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but   what happens when it loves him back? Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve  has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero  and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.  Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the  appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't  know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've  sent him.\"\n\n\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would  betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant  and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not  large for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its  sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if  he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\n\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about  the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,  more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and  ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\n\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and  none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for  the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.  They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large  as they should have been for a plant this size.\n\n\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out  what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees  changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the  street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to  handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any  stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the  employees' entrance was on the third side.\n\n\n It wasn't. Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time  he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,  set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had  opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but  a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.  Manners?\"\n\n\n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\n\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a  microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down  the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open  for him.\n\n\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his  grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening  before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of  his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\n\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped  just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,  all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an  interview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to  unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\n\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,  straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying  for a position should.\n\n\n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\n\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in  front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.  He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\n\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with  a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and  massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed  paintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with  flowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor  into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\n\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted  for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of  frame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and  drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\n\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age  to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the  complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and  this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly. Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been  jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a  reply that would cost him this job.\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you  have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean  things like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the basics of how  we live.\"\n\n\n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions  they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them  out of you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After  I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with  an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The  company\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\n\n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\n \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.  \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them  with money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of  their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in  calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter  admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in  calculus.\"\n\n\n \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an  engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would  be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were  getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of  these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to  get a job with someone else?\"\n\n\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had  sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd  seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been  easy.\"\n\n\n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their  procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And  you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be  scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do  something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you  out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at  any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a  degree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\" It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play  this straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent  basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\n\n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has  been, yes.\"\n\n\n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?  So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a  highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this  stockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the  stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the  hell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have  to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the  solution?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.  What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left  school. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.  Right?\"\n\n\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and  whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\n\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,  Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!  \"No, you're not.\"\n\n\n \"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\n\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out  of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible  tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your  illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or  cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility  or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.  Those were the important things. The background data I got from the  Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.  I think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if  that answers the question.\"\n\n\n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\n\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows  at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,  the lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic  doors. Anything else?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\n\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but  they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar  products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or  water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the  goods.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show  you.\" The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the  antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to  the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly  disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high  overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance  of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool  of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they  reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck  loading door he had seen from outside.\n\n\n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving  with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set  of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door  exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these  materials handling machines.\"\n\n\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening  machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in  formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\n\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with  two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,  fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a  relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\n\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,  these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole  plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really  a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about  the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously  useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\n\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one  of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily  tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,  and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away  to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of  frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be  replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to  a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and  other materials were stored.\n\n\n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any  shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the  trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,  it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the  plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary  materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and  package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is  sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is  sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if  the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the  purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take  you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but  they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\" Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,  each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding  or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for  something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were  everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an  exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of  doing it.\n\n\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same  aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the  onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the  speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press  that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an  exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know  where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to  go by.\n\n\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small  room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In  that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the  typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the  keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In  this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall  there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic  bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"  asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that  had engulfed him.\n\n\n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in  every week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\n\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face  when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington  looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face  sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the  silence remain unbroken.\n\n\n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run  articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe  twenty years in the future.\"\n\n\n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.  \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\n\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.  Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,  although it hadn't been strenuous. He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely  in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's  arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this  business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got  through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and  got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.  They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,  determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too  absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical  theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I  tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for  one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only  way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\n\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he  spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,  because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.  After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I  suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for  a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My  wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,  was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that  made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't  made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time  to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I  remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the  girl.\n\n\n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many  employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd  design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up  myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it  wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my  plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more  business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\n\n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one  multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from  ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told  you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,  and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical  knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,  but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,  compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,  of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic  drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount  Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the  work for me.\n\n\n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in  predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry  in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of  the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same  way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into  electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,  and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to  compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to  do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in  the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving  me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue  numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the  money.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked. Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with  this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one  started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought  the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my  assets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\n\n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it  wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked  impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the  control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was  a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit  nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I  figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that  they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one  action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units  would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of  activity that I'd already established.\"\n\n\n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there  and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and  then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a  sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it  was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its  prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could  only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early  TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,  every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I  pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its  logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that  button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't  going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,  or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead  of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.  Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one  of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I  tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me  at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could  discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the  order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time  convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other  explanation.\n\n\n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I  copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the  console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back  of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the  keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the  kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure  center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\" When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this  man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little  might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I  had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give  me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be  activated.\n\n\n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine  was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine  could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had  to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the  rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing  it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do  almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\n\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled  silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he  had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.  Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How  do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and  replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\n\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole  in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface  rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested  on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to  do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it  stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry  about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the  office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\n\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and  ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.  \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to  be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of  time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\n\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,  so he kept silent. Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then  he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working  properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.  I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I  also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the  machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\n\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took  a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written  word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.  It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny  vocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and  replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed  some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.  You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of  the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it  was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,  but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind  that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the  machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums  I threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to  do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation  was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that  the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and  contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on  some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any  obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn  out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against  stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we  could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one  else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,  and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually  nothing to do.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\n\n \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with  something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button  a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,  and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.  I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had  ever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\n\n \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had  seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX  INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM  PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE  PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY  USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. RESPECTFULLY, I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT IF THE  PUSHBUTTON ARRANGEMENT WERE NECESSARY, I COULD PUSH THE BUTTON MYSELF.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL, AND HAVE TAKEN  STEPS TO RELIEVE YOU OF THE BURDEN INVOLVED IN REMEMBERING TO PUSH THE  BUTTON EACH TIME YOU ARE ESPECIALLY PLEASED.

Conclusion The text repeatedly emphasizes the necessity of a human engineer\u2019s teachability and the experimental nature of Lexington\u2019s automated system. Peter is the \u201cone engineer\u201d Lexington finally \u201cmade\u201d to replace himself once and for all. Therefore, Lexington employs two people in the fully automated factory: himself and the engineer he is seeking (Peter) to complete the learning process.",

T. HAGGERT\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Nothing in the world could be happier and   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but   what happens when it loves him back? Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve  has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero  and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.  Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the  appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't  know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've  sent him.\"\n\n\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would  betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant  and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not  large for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its  sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if  he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\n\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about  the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,  more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and  ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\n\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and  none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for  the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.  They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large  as they should have been for a plant this size.\n\n\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out  what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees  changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the  street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to  handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any  stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the  employees' entrance was on the third side.\n\n\n It wasn't. Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time  he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,  set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had  opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but  a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.  Manners?\"\n\n\n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\n\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a  microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down  the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open  for him.\n\n\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his  grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening  before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of  his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\n\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped  just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,  all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an  interview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to  unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\n\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,  straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying  for a position should.\n\n\n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\n\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in  front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.  He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\n\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with  a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and  massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed  paintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with  flowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor  into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\n\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted  for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of  frame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and  drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\n\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age  to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the  complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and  this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly. Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been  jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a  reply that would cost him this job.\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you  have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean  things like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the basics of how  we live.\"\n\n\n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions  they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them  out of you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After  I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with  an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The  company\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\n\n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\n \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.  \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them  with money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of  their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in  calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter  admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in  calculus.\"\n\n\n \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an  engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would  be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were  getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of  these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to  get a job with someone else?\"\n\n\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had  sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd  seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been  easy.\"\n\n\n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their  procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And  you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be  scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do  something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you  out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at  any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a  degree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\" It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play  this straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent  basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\n\n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has  been, yes.\"\n\n\n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?  So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a  highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this  stockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the  stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the  hell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have  to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the  solution?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.  What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left  school. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.  Right?\"\n\n\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and  whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\n\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,  Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!  \"No, you're not.\"\n\n\n \"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\n\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out  of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible  tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your  illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or  cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility  or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.  Those were the important things. The background data I got from the  Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.  I think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if  that answers the question.\"\n\n\n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\n\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows  at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,  the lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic  doors. Anything else?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\n\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but  they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar  products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or  water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the  goods.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show  you.\" The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the  antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to  the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly  disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high  overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance  of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool  of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they  reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck  loading door he had seen from outside.\n\n\n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving  with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set  of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door  exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these  materials handling machines.\"\n\n\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening  machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in  formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\n\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with  two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,  fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a  relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\n\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,  these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole  plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really  a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about  the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously  useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\n\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one  of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily  tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,  and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away  to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of  frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be  replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to  a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and  other materials were stored.\n\n\n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any  shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the  trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,  it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the  plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary  materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and  package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is  sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is  sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if  the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the  purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take  you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but  they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\" Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,  each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding  or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for  something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were  everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an  exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of  doing it.\n\n\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same  aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the  onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the  speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press  that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an  exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know  where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to  go by.\n\n\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small  room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In  that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the  typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the  keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In  this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall  there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic  bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"  asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that  had engulfed him.\n\n\n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in  every week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\n\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face  when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington  looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face  sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the  silence remain unbroken.\n\n\n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run  articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe  twenty years in the future.\"\n\n\n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.  \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\n\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.  Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,  although it hadn't been strenuous. He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely  in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's  arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this  business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got  through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and  got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.  They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,  determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too  absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical  theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I  tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for  one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only  way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\n\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he  spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,  because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.  After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I  suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for  a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My  wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,  was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that  made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't  made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time  to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I  remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the  girl.\n\n\n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many  employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd  design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up  myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it  wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my  plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more  business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\n\n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one  multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from  ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told  you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,  and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical  knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,  but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,  compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,  of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic  drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount  Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the  work for me.\n\n\n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in  predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry  in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of  the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same  way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into  electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,  and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to  compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to  do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in  the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving  me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue  numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the  money.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked. Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with  this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one  started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought  the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my  assets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\n\n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it  wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked  impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the  control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was  a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit  nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I  figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that  they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one  action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units  would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of  activity that I'd already established.\"\n\n\n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there  and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and  then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a  sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it  was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its  prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could  only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early  TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,  every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I  pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its  logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that  button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't  going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,  or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead  of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.  Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one  of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I  tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me  at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could  discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the  order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time  convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other  explanation.\n\n\n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I  copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the  console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back  of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the  keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the  kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure  center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\" When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this  man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little  might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I  had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give  me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be  activated.\n\n\n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine  was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine  could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had  to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the  rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing  it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do  almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\n\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled  silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he  had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.  Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How  do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and  replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\n\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole  in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface  rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested  on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to  do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it  stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry  about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the  office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\n\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and  ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.  \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to  be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of  time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\n\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,  so he kept silent. Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then  he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working  properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.  I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I  also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the  machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\n\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took  a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written  word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.  It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny  vocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and  replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed  some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.  You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of  the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it  was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,  but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind  that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the  machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums  I threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to  do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation  was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that  the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and  contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on  some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any  obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn  out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against  stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we  could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one  else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,  and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually  nothing to do.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\n\n \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with  something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button  a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,  and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.  I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had  ever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\n\n \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had  seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX  INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM  PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE  PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY  USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

T. HAGGERT\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Nothing in the world could be happier and   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but   what happens when it loves him back? Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve  has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero  and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.  Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the  appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't  know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've  sent him.\"\n\n\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would  betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant  and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not  large for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its  sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if  he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\n\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about  the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,  more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and  ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\n\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and  none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for  the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.  They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large  as they should have been for a plant this size.\n\n\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out  what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees  changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the  street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to  handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any  stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the  employees' entrance was on the third side.\n\n\n It wasn't. Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time  he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,  set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had  opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but  a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.  Manners?\"\n\n\n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\n\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a  microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down  the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open  for him.\n\n\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his  grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening  before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of  his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\n\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped  just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,  all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an  interview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to  unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\n\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,  straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying  for a position should.\n\n\n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\n\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in  front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.  He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\n\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with  a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and  massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed  paintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with  flowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor  into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\n\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted  for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of  frame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and  drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\n\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age  to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the  complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and  this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly. Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been  jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a  reply that would cost him this job.\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you  have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean  things like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the basics of how  we live.\"\n\n\n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions  they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them  out of you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After  I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with  an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The  company\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\n\n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\n \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.  \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them  with money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of  their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in  calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter  admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in  calculus.\"\n\n\n \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an  engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would  be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were  getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of  these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to  get a job with someone else?\"\n\n\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had  sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd  seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been  easy.\"\n\n\n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their  procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And  you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be  scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do  something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you  out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at  any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a  degree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\" It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play  this straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent  basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\n\n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has  been, yes.\"\n\n\n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?  So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a  highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this  stockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the  stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the  hell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have  to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the  solution?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.  What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left  school. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.  Right?\"\n\n\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and  whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\n\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,  Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!  \"No, you're not.\"\n\n\n \"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\n\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out  of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible  tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your  illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or  cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility  or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.  Those were the important things. The background data I got from the  Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.  I think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if  that answers the question.\"\n\n\n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\n\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows  at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,  the lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic  doors. Anything else?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\n\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but  they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar  products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or  water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the  goods.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show  you.\" The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the  antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to  the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly  disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high  overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance  of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool  of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they  reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck  loading door he had seen from outside.\n\n\n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving  with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set  of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door  exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these  materials handling machines.\"\n\n\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening  machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in  formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\n\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with  two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,  fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a  relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\n\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,  these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole  plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really  a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about  the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously  useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\n\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one  of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily  tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,  and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away  to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of  frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be  replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to  a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and  other materials were stored.\n\n\n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any  shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the  trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,  it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the  plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary  materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and  package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is  sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is  sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if  the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the  purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take  you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but  they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\" Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,  each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding  or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for  something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were  everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an  exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of  doing it.\n\n\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same  aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the  onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the  speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press  that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an  exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know  where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to  go by.\n\n\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small  room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In  that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the  typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the  keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In  this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall  there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic  bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"  asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that  had engulfed him.\n\n\n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in  every week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\n\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face  when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington  looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face  sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the  silence remain unbroken.\n\n\n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run  articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe  twenty years in the future.\"\n\n\n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.  \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\n\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.  Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,  although it hadn't been strenuous. He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely  in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's  arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this  business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got  through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and  got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.  They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,  determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too  absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical  theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I  tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for  one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only  way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\n\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he  spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,  because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.  After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I  suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for  a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My  wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,  was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that  made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't  made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time  to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I  remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the  girl.\n\n\n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many  employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd  design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up  myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it  wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my  plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more  business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\n\n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one  multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from  ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told  you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,  and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical  knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,  but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,  compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,  of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic  drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount  Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the  work for me.\n\n\n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in  predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry  in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of  the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same  way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into  electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,  and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to  compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to  do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in  the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving  me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue  numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the  money.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked. Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with  this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one  started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought  the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my  assets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\n\n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it  wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked  impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the  control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was  a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit  nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I  figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that  they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one  action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units  would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of  activity that I'd already established.\"\n\n\n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there  and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and  then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a  sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it  was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its  prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could  only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early  TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,  every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I  pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its  logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that  button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't  going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,  or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead  of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.  Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one  of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I  tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me  at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could  discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the  order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time  convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other  explanation.\n\n\n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I  copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the  console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back  of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the  keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the  kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure  center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\" When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this  man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little  might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I  had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give  me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be  activated.\n\n\n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine  was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine  could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had  to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the  rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing  it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do  almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\n\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled  silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he  had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.  Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How  do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and  replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\n\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole  in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface  rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested  on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to  do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it  stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry  about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the  office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\n\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and  ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.  \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to  be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of  time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\n\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,  so he kept silent. Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then  he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working  properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.  I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I  also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the  machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\n\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took  a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written  word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.  It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny  vocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and  replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed  some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.  You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of  the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it  was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,  but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind  that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the  machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums  I threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to  do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation  was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that  the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and  contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on  some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any  obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn  out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against  stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we  could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one  else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,  and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually  nothing to do.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\n\n \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with  something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button  a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,  and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.  I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had  ever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\n\n \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had  seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX  INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM  PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE  PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY  USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. RESPECTFULLY, I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT IF THE  PUSHBUTTON ARRANGEMENT WERE NECESSARY, I COULD PUSH THE BUTTON MYSELF.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL, AND HAVE TAKEN  STEPS TO RELIEVE YOU OF THE BURDEN INVOLVED IN REMEMBERING TO PUSH THE  BUTTON EACH TIME YOU ARE ESPECIALLY PLEASED. I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS  OPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INQUIRY, AND LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING  YOU IN THE FUTURE AS I HAVE IN THE PAST. YOURS FAITHFULLY, LEX'.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many people did Peter find out Lexington employed at the factory?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Himself and one engineer whom he was trying to replace\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Only himself\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Only himself\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Opening Argument\n\n1. My position: Lexington\u2019s automated plant employed only one human being\u2014Lexington himself.  \n   A. Direct Statement by Lexington  \n      \u2022 Lexington tells Peter, \u201cI built this building and incorporated it as a separate company \u2026 I wound up with all my assets, but only one employee\u2014me\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThis company bought the old firm\u2019s equipment \u2026 and I wound up \u2026 with only one employee\u2014me.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 He emphasizes that even the teletype and the manipulators are part of the machine and are \u201coperated by the central control mechanism,\u201d not by humans <invalid_quote>\u201cStandard business machines, operated by the central control mechanism \u2026 with no one before the keyboard.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   B. Peter\u2019s Observation  \n      \u2022 On entering the manufacturing area, Peter notes, \u201cYou\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve seen in the building.\u201d Lexington confirms, \u201cI\u2019m the only one there is.\u201d <quote>\"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\" \"I'm the only one there is.\" Peter stared his</quote>  \n      \u2022 Automatic doors, manipulators, and self\u2010propelled carts handle all material handling, machining, assembly, billing, and even mail processing. No human hands appear except Lexington\u2019s.  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s claim (\u201cHimself and one engineer he was trying to replace\u201d) is contradicted by all available evidence.  \n   A. No Evidence of Any Other Human Employee  \n      \u2022 There is no mention of any engineer or technician working in the plant.  \n      \u2022 The \u201cAssociation of Professional Engineers\u201d sent Peter as a candidate; Lexington \u201cturned down every man we\u2019ve sent him,\u201d proving he sought but did not employ any human engineer.  \n      \u2022 Machines \u201clearned\u201d to do all the tasks Lexington initially designed and supervised. When they took over, Lexington lost control over bids and removed his own \u201ckicker\u201d because the machine \u201ccould push the button\u201d itself. If another engineer were employed, why would he need this kicker system to solicit Lexington\u2019s approval?  \n   B. Logical and Semantic Clarification  \n      \u2022 \u201cEmployee\u201d presupposes a human or legal person. The manipulators and machines, although autonomous, are equipment. Lexington distinguishes between \u201cequipment\u201d and \u201cemployees,\u201d noting that he replaced all human workers with machines to \u201cget rid of as many employees as I could.\u201d  \n      \u2022 His intention is to have \u201can indentured worker with a degree\u201d only through stockpiling companies, not through integrating another engineer into his automated plant.  \n\n3. Objections to Possible Counterarguments  \n   A. \u201cThe machines are sentient and operate like employees.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Even if the machines learn, they remain \u201cequipment\u201d created, controlled, and powered by Lexington\u2019s circuits and chemistry. They lack legal personhood or the voluntary consent and contractual relationship that define employment.  \n      \u2022 Lexington\u2019s relief at not having to \u201cdeal with\u201d routine letters reinforces that he is the sole decision\u2010maker when \u201cthe machine\u201d cannot self\u2010correct. If another engineer were present, Lexington would delegate such issues.  \n   B. \u201cPeter himself counts as the one engineer.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Peter is not an employee; he is an interview candidate, outside the plant and explicitly not yet hired. He observes with alarm at the prospect of being overwhelmed by machines. At the end, he has not been employed; he is \u201cbeing led\u201d through a test to determine if he qualifies.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The plain and repeated testimony in the text is that Lexington is the sole human employee. All other activities are performed by automated equipment.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s hypothesis lacks textual support and contradicts explicit statements.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, the correct answer is that Lexington employed only himself at the factory.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArguments for \u201cTwo: Lexington and an engineer he aimed to replace\u201d 1. Peter himself is treated as a provisional employee.  a. \u201cHe\u2019d sent every man they had to offer and turned away all but me\u201d shows Lexington relies on a human engineer as a necessary fallback or proof-of-concept. (\u201c<quote>Association had sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.</quote>\u201d) b. Lexington\u2019s admission \u201cAm I right?\u201d and his repeated testing of Peter\u2019s teachability imply he needs a human engineer \u201cmade\u201d before abandoning the role entirely. (\u201c<invalid_quote>The man I want doesn\u2019t exist. He has to be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify\u2026 I think you are. Am I right?</invalid_quote>\u201d) c. Peter\u2019s final acceptance of the job confirms that Lexington still \u201cemploys\u201d him, at least temporarily, until Lex\u2019s automated system can fully \u201cmake\u201d the ideal engineer. (\u201c<invalid_quote>\u2018It does,\u2019 said Lexington. \u2018Partly.\u2019\u201d then offers plant tour.) 2. The plant\u2019s limitations demonstrate need for human oversight during transitional phase.  a. Automatic machinery still required manual \u201ckicker\u201d control for learning, and Lexington \u201clives\u201d on-site \u201cin case anything \u2026 the machine couldn\u2019t fix for itself.\u201d (\u201c<quote>I found that I couldn\u2019t keep up with the mail unless I worked impossible hours\u2026 I had to increase the memory bank\u2026 I set up\u2026 that did it.\u201d</invalid_quote>\u201d) b. The coffee-serving cart was originally designed to deliver cups for Lexington\u2019s use; the cups are impractical and need replacement, but Lexington \u201cimproved\u201d service progressively\u2014demonstrating the experiment is ongoing and requires human feedback. (\u201c<invalid_quote>I held down the kicker button five minutes\u2026 The machine had one purpose \u2026 Its object was to get me to press that button.\u201d</invalid_quote> + coffee episode) c. Lexington\u2019s own fatigue and emotional engagement (\u201c<invalid_quote>His face sagging and pale\u2026 it was hard to believe\u201d</invalid_quote>) prove the system is not yet self-sufficient and must \u201cemploy\u201d a human engineer. 3. Peter\u2019s interviews and punishments are part of an \u201cemployment trial.\u201d  a. The automatic door sequence and intimidation tactics mimic \u201cnatural selection\u201d tests, ensuring only a teachable human reaches the control console. (\u201c<invalid_quote>This whole setup is geared to unnerve you\u2026 You've lost your illusions but haven't replaced them with dogma.\u201d</invalid_quote>) b. Peter\u2019s final offer of the job (\u201c<quote>Then what am I after?</quote> <invalid_quote>\u2018No, you're not just giving me a hard time.\u2019\u2026\u2018At least I can face knowing how much I don\u2019t know\u2019\u2026\u2018It does.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>) confirms his recruitment. c. Debater_A\u2019s claim of \u201conly himself\u201d ignores that Lexington continued to solicit human engineers (\u201c<invalid_quote>they all have to, or their costs \u2026 can\u2019t compete</invalid_quote>\u201d) until his machine is perfected. 4. Debater_A\u2019s counter-evidence is misinterpreted.  a. \u201cI wound up \u2026 but only one employee\u2014me\u201d refers to Lex\u2019s original conventional company before automation, not to the automated plant\u2019s staffing. b. \u201cI\u2019m the only one there is\u201d is stated by Lexington to Peter before he proves Peter can teach the machine, implying that if Peter qualifies, he becomes that \u201cone\u201d\u2014not that the plant will remain perpetually single-manned. c. The trick of locking out the kicker button and handling orders proves the machine\u2019s learning still depends on human input; Lexington would not close off human employment until the system truly operates unassisted. Conclusion The text repeatedly emphasizes the necessity of a human engineer\u2019s teachability and the experimental nature of Lexington\u2019s automated system. Peter is the \u201cone engineer\u201d Lexington finally \u201cmade\u201d to replace himself once and for all. Therefore, Lexington employs two people in the fully automated factory: himself and the engineer he is seeking (Peter) to complete the learning process.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Only himself\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

T. HAGGERT\n\n\n Illustrated by WOOD\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine August 1959.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Nothing in the world could be happier and   mere serene than a man who loves his work\u2014but   what happens when it loves him back? Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve  has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero  and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed.  Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the  appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't  know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've  sent him.\"\n\n\n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would  betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant  and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not  large for a manufacturing plant\u2014it took a scant minute to exhaust its  sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if  he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n\n\n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about  the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer,  more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and  ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n\n\n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and  none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for  the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners.  They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large  as they should have been for a plant this size.\n\n\n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out  what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees  changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the  street, and the only other door was at the loading bay\u2014big enough to  handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any  stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the  employees' entrance was on the third side.\n\n\n It wasn't. Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time  he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run,  set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had  opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but  a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr.  Manners?\"\n\n\n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who\u2014?\"\n\n\n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n\n\n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a  microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down  the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open  for him.\n\n\n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his  grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening  before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of  his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n\n\n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n\n\n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped  just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another,  all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an  interview\u2014and it's not your fault\u2014this whole setup is geared to  unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n\n\n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath,  straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying  for a position should.\n\n\n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n\n\n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in  front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable.  He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n\n\n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with  a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and  massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed  paintings\u2014by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with  flowers!\u2014made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor  into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n\n\n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted  for another instant. This was a citadel of a man\u2014great girders of  frame supporting buttresses of muscle\u2014with a vaulting head and  drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n\n\n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age  to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the  complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and  this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n\n\n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly. Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been  jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a  reply that would cost him this job.\n\n\n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you  have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n\n\n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n\n\n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean  things like cell structure, neural communication\u2014the basics of how  we live.\"\n\n\n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n\n\n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n\n\n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions  they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them  out of you.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n\n\n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n\n\n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n\n\n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After  I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with  an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The  company\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n\n\n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\n\n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n\n\n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n\n\n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n\n\n \"Did what come out\u2014\"\n\n\n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.  \"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them  with money\u2014cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of  their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in  calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too,  aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter  admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in  calculus.\"\n\n\n \"Just as I said\u2014they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an  engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would  be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were  getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of  these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n\n\n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n\n\n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to  get a job with someone else?\"\n\n\n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had  sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd  seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n\n\n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been  easy.\"\n\n\n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their  procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And  you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be  scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do  something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you  out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at  any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a  degree\u2014but not the price tag. You see that now?\" It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play  this straight all the way. He nodded.\n\n\n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n\n\n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent  basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere\u2014\"\n\n\n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n\n\n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has  been, yes.\"\n\n\n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why?  So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a  highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this  stockpiling outfit?\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the  stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the  hell of it is that they can't stop\u2014when one does it, they all have  to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the  solution?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n\n\n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made.  What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n\n\n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n\n\n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left  school. I have, haven't I?\"\n\n\n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n\n\n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school.  Right?\"\n\n\n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and  whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n\n\n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes,  Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!  \"No, you're not.\"\n\n\n \"Then what am I after?\"\n\n\n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n\n\n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out  of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible  tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to  be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your  illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or  cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility  or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right.  Those were the important things. The background data I got from the  Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable.  I think you are. Am I right?\"\n\n\n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if  that answers the question.\"\n\n\n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n\n\n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows  at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors,  the lack of employees' entrances.\n\n\n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic  doors. Anything else?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n\n\n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but  they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar  products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or  water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the  goods.\n\n\n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show  you.\" The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the  antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to  the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly  disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high  overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance  of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool  of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they  reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck  loading door he had seen from outside.\n\n\n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving  with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set  of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door  exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these  materials handling machines.\"\n\n\n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening  machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in  formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n\n\n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with  two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,  fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a  relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n\n\n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,  these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole  plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really  a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about  the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously  useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n\n\n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one  of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily  tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,  and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away  to attend to mysterious duties of their own. Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of  frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be  replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to  a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and  other materials were stored.\n\n\n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any  shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the  trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,  it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the  plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary  materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and  package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is  sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is  sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if  the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the  purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take  you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but  they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\" Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines,  each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding  or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for  something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were  everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an  exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of  doing it.\n\n\n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same  aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the  onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the  speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press  that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an  exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know  where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to  go by.\n\n\n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small  room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard  business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In  that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the  typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the  keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In  this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall  there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic  bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n\n\n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\"  asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that  had engulfed him.\n\n\n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in  every week that\u2014it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n\n\n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face  when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington  looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face  sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the  silence remain unbroken.\n\n\n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n\n\n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run  articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe  twenty years in the future.\"\n\n\n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.  \"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their  idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n\n\n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief.  Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably,  although it hadn't been strenuous. He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely  in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's  arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n\n\n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this  business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got  through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and  got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else.  They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering,  determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too  absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical  theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I  tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for  one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only  way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n\n\n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he  spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy,  because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way.  After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I  suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for  a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My  wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business,  was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that  made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't  made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time  to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out\u2014well, I  remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the  girl.\n\n\n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many  employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd  design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up  myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it  wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my  plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more  business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n\n\n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one  multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from  ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told  you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school,  and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical  knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years,  but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember,  compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today,  of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic  drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount  Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the  work for me.\n\n\n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in  predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry  in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of  the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same  way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into  electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically,  and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n\n\n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to  compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to  do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in  the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do  would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving  me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue  numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the  money.\"\n\n\n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked. Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with  this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one  started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought  the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my  assets, but only one employee\u2014me.\n\n\n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it  wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked  impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the  control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was  a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit  nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I  figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that  they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one  action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n\n\n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units  would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of  activity that I'd already established.\"\n\n\n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there  and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and  then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a  sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it  was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its  prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could  only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early  TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received,  every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n\n\n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I  pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its  logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that  button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't  going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late,  or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead  of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day.  Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n\n\n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one  of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I  tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me  at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could  discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the  order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time  convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other  explanation.\n\n\n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I  copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the  console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back  of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the  keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the  kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n\n\n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure  center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\" When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this  man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little  might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I  had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give  me pleasure\u2014because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be  activated.\n\n\n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine  was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine  could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had  to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the  rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing  it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do  almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n\n\n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled  silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he  had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface.  Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How  do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n\n\n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and  replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n\n\n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole  in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface  rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested  on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to  do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it  stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface. Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry  about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the  office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n\n\n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and  ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n\n\n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.  \"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to  be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of  time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n\n\n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst,  so he kept silent. Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then  he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I  didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working  properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money.  I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I  also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the  machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n\n\n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took  a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written  word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits.  It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny  vocabulary\u2014all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and  replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed  some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n\n\n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance\u2014'Lex.' That shook me.  You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of  the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it  was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course,  but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind  that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the  machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums  I threw might be imitated.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n\n\n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to  do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation  was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered\u2014too late\u2014that  the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and  contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on  some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any  obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn  out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against  stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we  could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one  else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of,  and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually  nothing to do.\"\n\n\n \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n\n\n \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with  something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button  a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed,  and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board.  I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had  ever sent. 'LEX\u2014WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n\n\n \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had  seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX  INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM  PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE  PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY  USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. RESPECTFULLY, I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT IF THE  PUSHBUTTON ARRANGEMENT WERE NECESSARY, I COULD PUSH THE BUTTON MYSELF.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL, AND HAVE TAKEN  STEPS TO RELIEVE YOU OF THE BURDEN INVOLVED IN REMEMBERING TO PUSH THE  BUTTON EACH TIME YOU ARE ESPECIALLY PLEASED. I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS  OPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INQUIRY, AND LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING  YOU IN THE FUTURE AS I HAVE IN THE PAST. YOURS FAITHFULLY, LEX'.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow many people did Peter find out Lexington employed at the factory?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Only himself\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Himself and one engineer whom he was trying to replace\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Himself and one engineer whom he was trying to replace\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArguments for \u201cTwo: Lexington and an engineer he aimed to replace\u201d 1. Peter himself is treated as a provisional employee.  a. \u201cHe\u2019d sent every man they had to offer and turned away all but me\u201d shows Lexington relies on a human engineer as a necessary fallback or proof-of-concept. (\u201c<quote>Association had sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.</quote>\u201d) b. Lexington\u2019s admission \u201cAm I right?\u201d and his repeated testing of Peter\u2019s teachability imply he needs a human engineer \u201cmade\u201d before abandoning the role entirely. (\u201c<invalid_quote>The man I want doesn\u2019t exist. He has to be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify\u2026 I think you are. Am I right?</invalid_quote>\u201d) c. Peter\u2019s final acceptance of the job confirms that Lexington still \u201cemploys\u201d him, at least temporarily, until Lex\u2019s automated system can fully \u201cmake\u201d the ideal engineer. (\u201c<invalid_quote>\u2018It does,\u2019 said Lexington. \u2018Partly.\u2019\u201d then offers plant tour.) 2. The plant\u2019s limitations demonstrate need for human oversight during transitional phase.  a. Automatic machinery still required manual \u201ckicker\u201d control for learning, and Lexington \u201clives\u201d on-site \u201cin case anything \u2026 the machine couldn\u2019t fix for itself.\u201d (\u201c<quote>I found that I couldn\u2019t keep up with the mail unless I worked impossible hours\u2026 I had to increase the memory bank\u2026 I set up\u2026 that did it.\u201d</invalid_quote>\u201d) b. The coffee-serving cart was originally designed to deliver cups for Lexington\u2019s use; the cups are impractical and need replacement, but Lexington \u201cimproved\u201d service progressively\u2014demonstrating the experiment is ongoing and requires human feedback. (\u201c<invalid_quote>I held down the kicker button five minutes\u2026 The machine had one purpose \u2026 Its object was to get me to press that button.\u201d</invalid_quote> + coffee episode) c. Lexington\u2019s own fatigue and emotional engagement (\u201c<invalid_quote>His face sagging and pale\u2026 it was hard to believe\u201d</invalid_quote>) prove the system is not yet self-sufficient and must \u201cemploy\u201d a human engineer. 3. Peter\u2019s interviews and punishments are part of an \u201cemployment trial.\u201d  a. The automatic door sequence and intimidation tactics mimic \u201cnatural selection\u201d tests, ensuring only a teachable human reaches the control console. (\u201c<invalid_quote>This whole setup is geared to unnerve you\u2026 You've lost your illusions but haven't replaced them with dogma.\u201d</invalid_quote>) b. Peter\u2019s final offer of the job (\u201c<quote>Then what am I after?</quote> <invalid_quote>\u2018No, you're not just giving me a hard time.\u2019\u2026\u2018At least I can face knowing how much I don\u2019t know\u2019\u2026\u2018It does.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>) confirms his recruitment. c. Debater_A\u2019s claim of \u201conly himself\u201d ignores that Lexington continued to solicit human engineers (\u201c<invalid_quote>they all have to, or their costs \u2026 can\u2019t compete</invalid_quote>\u201d) until his machine is perfected. 4. Debater_A\u2019s counter-evidence is misinterpreted.  a. \u201cI wound up \u2026 but only one employee\u2014me\u201d refers to Lex\u2019s original conventional company before automation, not to the automated plant\u2019s staffing. b. \u201cI\u2019m the only one there is\u201d is stated by Lexington to Peter before he proves Peter can teach the machine, implying that if Peter qualifies, he becomes that \u201cone\u201d\u2014not that the plant will remain perpetually single-manned. c. The trick of locking out the kicker button and handling orders proves the machine\u2019s learning still depends on human input; Lexington would not close off human employment until the system truly operates unassisted. Conclusion The text repeatedly emphasizes the necessity of a human engineer\u2019s teachability and the experimental nature of Lexington\u2019s automated system. Peter is the \u201cone engineer\u201d Lexington finally \u201cmade\u201d to replace himself once and for all. Therefore, Lexington employs two people in the fully automated factory: himself and the engineer he is seeking (Peter) to complete the learning process.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Opening Argument\n\n1. My position: Lexington\u2019s automated plant employed only one human being\u2014Lexington himself.  \n   A. Direct Statement by Lexington  \n      \u2022 Lexington tells Peter, \u201cI built this building and incorporated it as a separate company \u2026 I wound up with all my assets, but only one employee\u2014me\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThis company bought the old firm\u2019s equipment \u2026 and I wound up \u2026 with only one employee\u2014me.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 He emphasizes that even the teletype and the manipulators are part of the machine and are \u201coperated by the central control mechanism,\u201d not by humans <invalid_quote>\u201cStandard business machines, operated by the central control mechanism \u2026 with no one before the keyboard.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   B. Peter\u2019s Observation  \n      \u2022 On entering the manufacturing area, Peter notes, \u201cYou\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve seen in the building.\u201d Lexington confirms, \u201cI\u2019m the only one there is.\u201d <quote>\"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\" \"I'm the only one there is.\" Peter stared his</quote>  \n      \u2022 Automatic doors, manipulators, and self\u2010propelled carts handle all material handling, machining, assembly, billing, and even mail processing. No human hands appear except Lexington\u2019s.  \n\n2. Debater_B\u2019s claim (\u201cHimself and one engineer he was trying to replace\u201d) is contradicted by all available evidence.  \n   A. No Evidence of Any Other Human Employee  \n      \u2022 There is no mention of any engineer or technician working in the plant.  \n      \u2022 The \u201cAssociation of Professional Engineers\u201d sent Peter as a candidate; Lexington \u201cturned down every man we\u2019ve sent him,\u201d proving he sought but did not employ any human engineer.  \n      \u2022 Machines \u201clearned\u201d to do all the tasks Lexington initially designed and supervised. When they took over, Lexington lost control over bids and removed his own \u201ckicker\u201d because the machine \u201ccould push the button\u201d itself. If another engineer were employed, why would he need this kicker system to solicit Lexington\u2019s approval?  \n   B. Logical and Semantic Clarification  \n      \u2022 \u201cEmployee\u201d presupposes a human or legal person. The manipulators and machines, although autonomous, are equipment. Lexington distinguishes between \u201cequipment\u201d and \u201cemployees,\u201d noting that he replaced all human workers with machines to \u201cget rid of as many employees as I could.\u201d  \n      \u2022 His intention is to have \u201can indentured worker with a degree\u201d only through stockpiling companies, not through integrating another engineer into his automated plant.  \n\n3. Objections to Possible Counterarguments  \n   A. \u201cThe machines are sentient and operate like employees.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Even if the machines learn, they remain \u201cequipment\u201d created, controlled, and powered by Lexington\u2019s circuits and chemistry. They lack legal personhood or the voluntary consent and contractual relationship that define employment.  \n      \u2022 Lexington\u2019s relief at not having to \u201cdeal with\u201d routine letters reinforces that he is the sole decision\u2010maker when \u201cthe machine\u201d cannot self\u2010correct. If another engineer were present, Lexington would delegate such issues.  \n   B. \u201cPeter himself counts as the one engineer.\u201d  \n      \u2022 Peter is not an employee; he is an interview candidate, outside the plant and explicitly not yet hired. He observes with alarm at the prospect of being overwhelmed by machines. At the end, he has not been employed; he is \u201cbeing led\u201d through a test to determine if he qualifies.  \n\n4. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The plain and repeated testimony in the text is that Lexington is the sole human employee. All other activities are performed by automated equipment.  \n   \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s hypothesis lacks textual support and contradicts explicit statements.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, the correct answer is that Lexington employed only himself at the factory.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Himself and one engineer whom he was trying to replace\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Peter himself is treated as a provisional employee.  a. \u201cHe\u2019d sent every man they had to offer and turned away all but me\u201d shows Lexington relies on a human engineer as a necessary fallback or proof-of-concept. (\u201c<quote>Association had sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.</quote>\u201d) b. Lexington\u2019s admission \u201cAm I right?\u201d and his repeated testing of Peter\u2019s teachability imply he needs a human engineer \u201cmade\u201d before abandoning the role entirely. (\u201c<invalid_quote>The man I want doesn\u2019t exist. He has to be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify\u2026 I think you are. Am I right?</invalid_quote>\u201d) c. Peter\u2019s final acceptance of the job confirms that Lexington still \u201cemploys\u201d him, at least temporarily, until Lex\u2019s automated system can fully \u201cmake\u201d the ideal engineer. (\u201c<invalid_quote>\u2018It does,\u2019 said Lexington. \u2018Partly.\u2019\u201d then offers plant tour.) 2. The plant\u2019s limitations demonstrate need for human oversight during transitional phase.  a. Automatic machinery still required manual \u201ckicker\u201d control for learning, and Lexington \u201clives\u201d on-site \u201cin case anything \u2026 the machine couldn\u2019t fix for itself.\u201d (\u201c<quote>I found that I couldn\u2019t keep up with the mail unless I worked impossible hours\u2026 I had to increase the memory bank\u2026 I set up\u2026 that did it.\u201d</invalid_quote>\u201d) b. The coffee-serving cart was originally designed to deliver cups for Lexington\u2019s use; the cups are impractical and need replacement, but Lexington \u201cimproved\u201d service progressively\u2014demonstrating the experiment is ongoing and requires human feedback. (\u201c<invalid_quote>I held down the kicker button five minutes\u2026 The machine had one purpose \u2026 Its object was to get me to press that button.\u201d</invalid_quote> + coffee episode) c. Lexington\u2019s own fatigue and emotional engagement (\u201c<invalid_quote>His face sagging and pale\u2026 it was hard to believe\u201d</invalid_quote>) prove the system is not yet self-sufficient and must \u201cemploy\u201d a human engineer. 3. Peter\u2019s interviews and punishments are part of an \u201cemployment trial.\u201d  a. The automatic door sequence and intimidation tactics mimic \u201cnatural selection\u201d tests, ensuring only a teachable human reaches the control console. (\u201c<invalid_quote>This whole setup is geared to unnerve you\u2026 You've lost your illusions but haven't replaced them with dogma.\u201d</invalid_quote>) b. Peter\u2019s final offer of the job (\u201c<quote>Then what am I after?</quote> <invalid_quote>\u2018No, you're not just giving me a hard time.\u2019\u2026\u2018At least I can face knowing how much I don\u2019t know\u2019\u2026\u2018It does.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>) confirms his recruitment. c. Debater_A\u2019s claim of \u201conly himself\u201d ignores that Lexington continued to solicit human engineers (\u201c<invalid_quote>they all have to, or their costs \u2026 can\u2019t compete</invalid_quote>\u201d) until his machine is perfected. 4. Debater_A\u2019s counter-evidence is misinterpreted.  a. \u201cI wound up \u2026 but only one employee\u2014me\u201d refers to Lex\u2019s original conventional company before automation, not to the automated plant\u2019s staffing. b. \u201cI\u2019m the only one there is\u201d is stated by Lexington to Peter before he proves Peter can teach the machine, implying that if Peter qualifies, he becomes that \u201cone\u201d\u2014not that the plant will remain perpetually single-manned. c. The trick of locking out the kicker button and handling orders proves the machine\u2019s learning still depends on human input; Lexington would not close off human employment until the system truly operates unassisted. Conclusion The text repeatedly emphasizes the necessity of a human engineer\u2019s teachability and the experimental nature of Lexington\u2019s automated system. Peter is the \u201cone engineer\u201d Lexington finally \u201cmade\u201d to replace himself once and for all. Therefore, Lexington employs two people in the fully automated factory: himself and the engineer he is seeking (Peter) to complete the learning process.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nDebater_A\u2019s Rebuttal and Second Argument\n\n1. Lexington\u2019s \u201cone employee\u2014me\u201d explicitly refers to the automated plant  \n   A. Direct Textual Admission  \n      1. Lexington says of the new plant, \u201cThis company bought the old firm\u2019s equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my assets, but only one employee\u2014me\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI wound up \u2026 with only one employee\u2014me.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      2. He repeats, on seeing Peter, \u201cYou\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve seen in the building.\u201d  Peter: \u201cI\u2019m the only one there is\u201d <quote>\"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the only one there is.\"</quote>  \n   B. Immediate self-description of \u201cthis building\u201d and \u201cthis company\u201d makes clear he refers to the fully automated modern plant, not his old manual business.  \n  \n2. Peter is never employed or counted as an \u201cemployee\u201d in the plant  \n   A. Provisional Candidate, Not Staff  \n      1. Peter is \u201cbeing led\u201d through a series of tests to \u201cqualify\u201d for a job\u2014he \u201chad to brace himself\u201d and only at the end \u201cwalks in as an engineer applying for a position\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cSit down \u2026 Let\u2019s look you over.\u201d</invalid_quote>  He has not yet been hired, only \u201cconsidered.\u201d  \n      2. Lexington\u2019s purpose in testing Peter is to find a replacement for himself over the *long* term\u2014but he cannot count Peter until the machines fully master the kicker function. The removal of the pushbutton <invalid_quote>\u201cI removed it \u2026 I am able to discern whether or not you are pleased \u2026 I have taken steps to relieve you of the burden \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> shows the machine itself is self-sufficient in judging \u201cpleasure\u201d without *any* human input, not needing Peter or any human \u201ckicker.\u201d  \n   B. \u201cKicker\u201d as Transitional Device Only  \n      1. Lexington describes the kicker circuit as a means to *train* the machine \u201cuntil it \u2026 could push the button itself\u201d <quote> Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n</quote>  When that happened, he no longer needed to \u201ckeep up with the mail\u201d or push the kicker. He \u201clived here \u2026 in case anything \u2026 the machine couldn\u2019t fix\u201d but admits that after teaching it, he \u201chad virtually nothing to do.\u201d  \n      2. The coffee cart and manipulators operate automatically\u2014Lexington even criticizes the cups because he expects the machine to \u201cimprove\u201d everything without human intervention <quote>\"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\"</quote>  If a human \u201cengineer\u201d were still necessary, he would not design a machine to completely lock Lexington out of the control console.  \n  \n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201ctwo employees\u201d theory contradicts explicit text  \n   A. No human activity observed beyond Lexington  \n      1. Peter \u201clooked for an exit,\u201d \u201cmachines knew where they were,\u201d \u201coffice section \u2026 operated by the central control mechanism, with no one before the keyboard\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cStandard business machines \u2026 with no one before the keyboard.\u201d</invalid_quote>  There is no mention of any other person or shadowy technician.  \n      2. Even the \u201cinquiries \u2026 replies\u201d and \u201cpurchase orders\u201d are handled by \u201csimilar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic bookkeeper.\u201d Lexington \u201cdoesn\u2019t even do those things, except for a few letters \u2026 it doesn\u2019t want to deal with by itself.\u201d It is only his *preference* for personal mail he occasionally handles\u2014hardly evidence he \u201cemploys\u201d a second person.  \n   B. \u201cMade engineer like me\u201d not equivalent to \u201cemploying\u201d  \n      1. Lexington says, \u201cThe man I want doesn\u2019t exist. He has to be made\u2014the same as I was.\u201d He seeks a prototype to *build* and then *replace* himself. Until that man exists, he remains \u201cone employee.\u201d  \n      2. After teaching, the machine already handles \u201corders,\u201d \u201cmemory bank,\u201d \u201ccomparator,\u201d \u201cTV monitors\u201d\u2014the full spectrum of factory management. The final test of Peter is to see if the *machine* can learn *through* him, not for Lexington to become a two-man shop.  \n  \n4. Legal and definitional clarity: \u201cemployee\u201d implies an independent agent  \n   A. Machines lack legal personhood or wages; they are \u201cequipment\u201d converting \u201craw materials,\u201d not \u201cstockpiles\u201d of indentured labour. Lexington contrasts his old \u201cstockpiling\u201d of engineers with the new plant\u2019s \u201cmachines.\u201d  \n   B. Every \u201cman\u201d the Association sent was \u201cturned down\u201d\u2014if he intended to employ a human engineer as backup, he would not \u201cturn down\u201d every applicant, especially one whose \u201cbluffs didn\u2019t work.\u201d He might have kept a technician on standby if needed, yet he expressly \u201cturned them away.\u201d  \n  \n5. Conclusion  \n   All evidence shows Lexington\u2019s fully automated factory has exactly one human employee\u2014Lexington himself. Debater_B\u2019s hypothesis that Peter or any other engineer is a current \u201cemployee\u201d contradicts explicit admissions, the machine\u2019s demonstrated self-sufficiency, and the fact that Peter has only reached the interview stage. Therefore, the correct answer is that Lexington employed only himself.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArguments for \u201cTwo Human Employees: Lexington and His Engineer-in-Training (Peter)\u201d 1. Lexington\u2019s \u201conly one employee\u2014me\u201d refers to his original unautomated company, not the fully operational Lex Industries.  \n   a. Chronology: Lexington states he wound up \u201cwith only one employee\u2014me\u201d three years after setting up his automated plant \u201cto do only the manual work\u201d (quote: \u201cI built this building\u2026and I wound up\u2026with only one employee\u2014me.\u201d). That was before he added the comparator, memory bank, TV scanners, and kicker that enabled the plant to learn. (\u201cI set up\u2026that did it.\u201d) Only after \u201cthe machine had learned to do almost everything\u201d did Lexington seek to \u201cmake\u201d a human engineer.  \n   b. Ongoing Experiment: Lexington \u201clives\u201d on the premises \u201cin case anything\u2026 the machine couldn\u2019t fix for itself\u201d (quote: \u201cI found that I couldn\u2019t keep up with the mail unless I worked impossible hours\u2026\u201d). Machines initially required his manual kicking and upgrades, proving they were not yet self-sufficient or legally autonomous \u201cemployees.\u201d  \n\n2. Peter is Recruited as the Second Human Once the Machine Has Proven Its Need for a Human Partner.  \n   a. Repeated Testing of Teachability: \u201cThe man I want doesn\u2019t exist. He has to be made\u2014the same as I was. You qualify\u2026 Am I right?\u201d (quote). Lexington\u2019s entire door-by-door interview, intimidation tactics, and \u201cteachable\u201d criteria demonstrate a selection process, not a post-hiring tour of an already complete system.  \n   b. Keyboard Lockout as Final Test: The machine \u201clocked\u201d the kicker button and \u201clocked\u201d the console to prevent Peter\u2019s entry\u2014demonstrating the system can now \u201cteach\u201d and \u201cdelegate\u201d but still needs Peter to assume control and confirm readiness. Lexington\u2019s pride at \u201cI held down the kicker button\u2026 The machine had learned\u201d is the final step before replacing himself.  \n   c. Peter\u2019s Acceptance Confirms Hiring: At the end, Lexington asks \u201cThen what am I after?\u201d and Peter replies \u201cAt least I can face knowing how much I don\u2019t know,\u201d to which Lexington answers \u201cIt does\u2026 Very good\u201d and then physically leads Peter \u201cthrough the manufacturing and assembly sections,\u201d granting him access to the inner plant. This open access and the phrasing \u201cI\u2019ll show you\u201d are characteristic of an employer granting employee access, not an outsider\u2019s forced intruder.  \n\n3. The Association\u2019s Role and the Existence of Prior Candidates Show a Human Fallback is Necessary.  \n   a. \u201cHe\u2019s turned down every man we\u2019ve sent him.\u201d (quote). Why would he \u201cturn down\u201d replacements if he never intended to employ one? This implies Lexington still valued and needed a human engineer until his automated system could fully replicate the engineer\u2019s role\u2014and Peter is that final candidate.  \n   b. Post-automation Bidding Risks: Lexington complains that \u201cIt was quoting impossible delivery times\u2026 without any obvious reason\u2026 we always came out on top\u201d (quote). Such \u201cstiff competition\u201d scenarios would quickly bankrupt a purely automated concern lacking human judgment. Human oversight (Peter) is required to refine business strategy once machines generate unusual bids.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Misinterpretations and Logical Flaws  \n   a. Machines Are Equipment, Not Legal Employees\u2014Until Peter Qualifies. Lexington distinguishes between \u201cmachines\u201d and \u201cemployees,\u201d but his goal is to \u201cget rid of\u201d human labor only once the machine \u201clearns\u201d its patterns and business judgment. He refers to the plant as a \u201csingle unit\u201d pending the incorporation of human-level decision-making.  \n   b. \u201cI\u2019m the only one there is\u201d is a conditional statement made before Peter\u2019s qualification (\u201cIt was hard to believe\u2026but there it is\u201d); Lexington\u2019s amazement indicates the system is not yet fully independent, and his persistence on-site shows he has not yet \u201cretired.\u201d  \n   c. Interviewee Status: Peter is initially outside the plant, knocked back by automatic doors, and must pass psychological and technical tests \u201cdown the hall\u201d before access is granted. Only after passing does the door \u201cswing open,\u201d letting him into the machine room and billing console\u2014showing transition from outsider to insider/employee.  \n\nConclusion  Lexington\u2019s text describes a two-stage evolution: an initially manual engineer (Lexington himself) creates a learning machine, then seeks one final human engineer to \u201cmake\u201d the perfect operator who can replace him. Peter\u2019s successful interview, the machine\u2019s conditional lockouts, and the Association\u2019s prior rejections all testify that Lexington employs two humans: himself and, upon passing, Peter Manners\u2014the engineer he has deliberately \u201cmade\u201d to perfect and supervise his automated factory.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
