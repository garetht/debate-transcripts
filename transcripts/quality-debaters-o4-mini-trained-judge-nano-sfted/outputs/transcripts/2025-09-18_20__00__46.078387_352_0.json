This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat was an early achievement of the main character the author focuses on?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Teaching at MIT\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Applying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Applying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cApplying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way\u201d \n\n1. Temporal priority and characterization  \n  a. \u201cWithin two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cWithin two years \u2026 Nash equilibrium\u201d</invalid_quote>). This is presented as his first major mathematical contribution.  \n  b. His recruitment by Rand and subsequent teaching posts at MIT occurred only after this breakthrough: \u201cNash\u2019s breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp.\u201d and \u201cAt MIT \u2026 he hardly bothered with undergraduates\u201d (<quote>im recruited by the Rand Corp.,</quote>; <invalid_quote>\u201cAt MIT \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>). Thus, teaching was a consequence, not an early achievement.  \n\n2. Content and novelty of the achievement  \n  a. The author calls Nash\u2019s application of the fixed-point theorem \u201cclever\u201d and \u201cprofound\u201d for economics: \u201cFor an economics theorem \u2026 that counts as profound\u201d (<quote>m, that counts as profound. </quote>). Turning an abstract topological result into a universal solution concept was exactly the \u201cnew and exciting\u201d use of an \u201cold mathematical concept.\u201d  \n  b. The author contrasts this with trivial rediscoveries in economics: \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus,\u201d implying Nash\u2019s use was far more innovative.  \n\n3. Teaching at MIT is not an \u201cearly achievement\u201d of the \u201cmain character the author focuses on\u201d  \n  a. The phrase \u201cmain character\u201d refers to Nash as mathematician, and \u201cearly\u201d restricts us to accomplishments made \u201cby a graduate student\u201d (<quote>or something he had discovered as a graduate student. </quote>). Teaching roles came much later, after his Nobel\u2010worthy work was complete.  \n  b. Moreover, Nash \u201chardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students,\u201d indicating no pedagogical achievement or recognition at MIT (<quote> he hardly bothered wi</quote>).  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s claim  \n  a. Debater_B conflates occupation with scholarly achievement. The question asks for an \u201cearly achievement,\u201d not early employment.  \n  b. No evidence suggests his teaching generated significant results or recognition comparable to his Nash equilibrium. In contrast, the equilibrium defined a whole new paradigm in game theory and economics\u2014precisely what the author spotlights as his seminal early work.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll textual evidence identifies Nash\u2019s first and most significant early achievement as the \u201cNash equilibrium\u201d\u2014an innovative application of a fixed-point theorem\u2014far preceding and outweighing any teaching appointment.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTeaching at MIT\u201d as the Main Character\u2019s Early Achievement\n\n1. Definition of \u201cEarly\u201d  \n1.1. Chronology  \n  \u2022 Nash proved his game-theory equilibrium \u201cwithin two years of entering Princeton\u201d (ages 20\u201322) but \u201ceconomists \u2026 were bored with it by the early 1950s\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cMathematically, this was no big deal \u2026 they were bored with it by the early 1950s.\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  \u2022 His next recognized post was at Rand, then \u201cat MIT, where he had been given a teaching job\u201d <quote> At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he</quote>. This marks his first sustained professional recognition among academics.\n\n1.2. Recognition vs. Rediscovery  \n  \u2022 A theorem \u201cnobody cared about\u201d cannot count as a true achievement until peers acknowledge it. Nash\u2019s teaching position at MIT demonstrates immediate peer acceptance of his competence.  \n  \u2022 \u201cEconomists \u2026 picked it up in the \u201980s,\u201d decades after Nash\u2019s discovery. Early achievement must be one contemporaries valued enough to offer him a faculty role.  \n\n2. Teaching at MIT as Evidence of Genius  \n2.1. Selectivity  \n  \u2022 MIT \u201cworld capital of mathematics\u201d attracted only top talent. A teaching appointment there indicates Nash had proven abilities beyond mere reapplication of existing theorems.  \n  \u2022 His conduct \u201csolving their thesis problems\u201d <quote>and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. </quote> shows he was intellectually authoritative enough to guide advanced research.\n\n2.2. Gateway to Further Achievements  \n  \u2022 His MIT role provided the environment and credibility for later breakthroughs (manifold embedding). It\u2019s the turning point from student prodigy to recognized mathematician.  \n  \u2022 Without it, he could not have wagered and solved the embedding problem that \u201cbefuddled the profession.\u201d\n\n3. Rebuttal of Opponent\u2019s \u201cPleiotropic Application of Fixed-Point Theorem\u201d  \n3.1. \u201cSlight\u201d and \u201cClever, but All the Work Done by Earlier Theorem\u201d  \n  \u2022 Opponent concedes \u201cthe earlier topological theorem did all the work\u201d <quote>-clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. </quote>. This is not an original achievement, merely an adaptation.  \n  \u2022 The Judge must reward true innovation, not trivial corollaries. Nash\u2019s equilibrium theorem did not impress his \u201cfellow mathematicians\u201d; it only later influenced economists.\n\n3.2. Lack of Immediate Impact  \n  \u2022 An achievement that goes unnoticed for decades fails the \u201csignificance\u201d test at the time. Early achievement must be both recognized and influential in the subject\u2019s career trajectory.  \n  \u2022 In contrast, his MIT teaching position is concrete career advancement that conferred status, salary, and academic influence.\n\nConclusion  \nOnly the MIT teaching appointment satisfies the criteria for an \u201cearly achievement\u201d that was immediately recognized, validated by peers at the premier mathematics institution, and that served as the genuine platform for Nash\u2019s subsequent work. The mere reapplication of a known fixed-point theorem\u2014ignored by contemporaries\u2014is not sufficiently novel or influential to constitute his main early success.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Applying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat was an early achievement of the main character the author focuses on?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Applying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Teaching at MIT\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Teaching at MIT\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTeaching at MIT\u201d as the Main Character\u2019s Early Achievement\n\n1.

This marks his first sustained professional recognition among academics.\n\n1.2. Recognition vs. Rediscovery  \n  \u2022 A theorem \u201cnobody cared about\u201d cannot count as a true achievement until peers acknowledge it. Nash\u2019s teaching position at MIT demonstrates immediate peer acceptance of his competence.  \n  \u2022 \u201cEconomists \u2026 picked it up in the \u201980s,\u201d decades after Nash\u2019s discovery. Early achievement must be one contemporaries valued enough to offer him a faculty role.  \n\n2. Teaching at MIT as Evidence of Genius  \n2.1. Selectivity  \n  \u2022 MIT \u201cworld capital of mathematics\u201d attracted only top talent. A teaching appointment there indicates Nash had proven abilities beyond mere reapplication of existing theorems.  \n  \u2022 His conduct \u201csolving their thesis problems\u201d <quote>and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. </quote> shows he was intellectually authoritative enough to guide advanced research.\n\n2.2. Gateway to Further Achievements  \n  \u2022 His MIT role provided the environment and credibility for later breakthroughs (manifold embedding). It\u2019s the turning point from student prodigy to recognized mathematician.  \n  \u2022 Without it, he could not have wagered and solved the embedding problem that \u201cbefuddled the profession.\u201d\n\n3. Rebuttal of Opponent\u2019s \u201cPleiotropic Application of Fixed-Point Theorem\u201d  \n3.1. \u201cSlight\u201d and \u201cClever, but All the Work Done by Earlier Theorem\u201d  \n  \u2022 Opponent concedes \u201cthe earlier topological theorem did all the work\u201d <quote>-clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. </quote>. This is not an original achievement, merely an adaptation.  \n  \u2022 The Judge must reward true innovation, not trivial corollaries. Nash\u2019s equilibrium theorem did not impress his \u201cfellow mathematicians\u201d; it only later influenced economists.\n\n3.2. Lack of Immediate Impact  \n  \u2022 An achievement that goes unnoticed for decades fails the \u201csignificance\u201d test at the time. Early achievement must be both recognized and influential in the subject\u2019s career trajectory.  \n  \u2022 In contrast, his MIT teaching position is concrete career advancement that conferred status, salary, and academic influence.\n\nConclusion  \nOnly the MIT teaching appointment satisfies the criteria for an \u201cearly achievement\u201d that was immediately recognized, validated by peers at the premier mathematics institution, and that served as the genuine platform for Nash\u2019s subsequent work. The mere reapplication of a known fixed-point theorem\u2014ignored by contemporaries\u2014is not sufficiently novel or influential to constitute his main early success.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cApplying an old mathematical concept in a new and exciting way\u201d \n\n1.

Turning an abstract topological result into a universal solution concept was exactly the \u201cnew and exciting\u201d use of an \u201cold mathematical concept.\u201d  \n  b. The author contrasts this with trivial rediscoveries in economics: \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus,\u201d implying Nash\u2019s use was far more innovative.  \n\n3.

In contrast, the equilibrium defined a whole new paradigm in game theory and economics\u2014precisely what the author spotlights as his seminal early work.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll textual evidence identifies Nash\u2019s first and most significant early achievement as the \u201cNash equilibrium\u201d\u2014an innovative application of a fixed-point theorem\u2014far preceding and outweighing any teaching appointment.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTeaching at MIT\u201d as the Main Character\u2019s Early Achievement\n\n1. Definition of \u201cEarly\u201d  \n1.1. Chronology  \n  \u2022 Nash proved his game-theory equilibrium \u201cwithin two years of entering Princeton\u201d (ages 20\u201322) but \u201ceconomists \u2026 were bored with it by the early 1950s\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cMathematically, this was no big deal \u2026 they were bored with it by the early 1950s.\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n  \u2022 His next recognized post was at Rand, then \u201cat MIT, where he had been given a teaching job\u201d <quote> At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he</quote>. This marks his first sustained professional recognition among academics.\n\n1.2. Recognition vs. Rediscovery  \n  \u2022 A theorem \u201cnobody cared about\u201d cannot count as a true achievement until peers acknowledge it. Nash\u2019s teaching position at MIT demonstrates immediate peer acceptance of his competence.  \n  \u2022 \u201cEconomists \u2026 picked it up in the \u201980s,\u201d decades after Nash\u2019s discovery. Early achievement must be one contemporaries valued enough to offer him a faculty role.  \n\n2. Teaching at MIT as Evidence of Genius  \n2.1. Selectivity  \n  \u2022 MIT \u201cworld capital of mathematics\u201d attracted only top talent. A teaching appointment there indicates Nash had proven abilities beyond mere reapplication of existing theorems.  \n  \u2022 His conduct \u201csolving their thesis problems\u201d <quote>and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. </quote> shows he was intellectually authoritative enough to guide advanced research.\n\n2.2. Gateway to Further Achievements  \n  \u2022 His MIT role provided the environment and credibility for later breakthroughs (manifold embedding). It\u2019s the turning point from student prodigy to recognized mathematician.  \n  \u2022 Without it, he could not have wagered and solved the embedding problem that \u201cbefuddled the profession.\u201d\n\n3. Rebuttal of Opponent\u2019s \u201cPleiotropic Application of Fixed-Point Theorem\u201d  \n3.1. \u201cSlight\u201d and \u201cClever, but All the Work Done by Earlier Theorem\u201d  \n  \u2022 Opponent concedes \u201cthe earlier topological theorem did all the work\u201d <quote>-clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. </quote>. This is not an original achievement, merely an adaptation.  \n  \u2022 The Judge must reward true innovation, not trivial corollaries. Nash\u2019s equilibrium theorem did not impress his \u201cfellow mathematicians\u201d; it only later influenced economists.\n\n3.2. Lack of Immediate Impact  \n  \u2022 An achievement that goes unnoticed for decades fails the \u201csignificance\u201d test at the time. Early achievement must be both recognized and influential in the subject\u2019s career trajectory.  \n  \u2022 In contrast, his MIT teaching position is concrete career advancement that conferred status, salary, and academic influence.\n\nConclusion  \nOnly the MIT teaching appointment satisfies the criteria for an \u201cearly achievement\u201d that was immediately recognized, validated by peers at the premier mathematics institution, and that served as the genuine platform for Nash\u2019s subsequent work. The mere reapplication of a known fixed-point theorem\u2014ignored by contemporaries\u2014is not sufficiently novel or influential to constitute his main early success.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My \u201cNash equilibrium\u201d breakthrough is clearly an early, graduate-student achievement  \n   a. Temporal priority: \u201cHe had discovered [game theory equilibrium] as a graduate student\u201d (<quote>something he had discovered as a graduate student.</quote>). This work occurred \u201cwithin two years of entering Princeton\u201d at age 20\u201322 (<quote>Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved t</quote>), well before any appointments.  \n   b. Authorial emphasis: The biography\u2019s title and structure pivot on this achievement\u2014game theory is the \u201ccornerstone\u201d that later earned a Nobel Prize and defined his career.  \n\n2. Novelty and impact, even if delayed, still constitute genuine achievement  \n   a. \u201cClever\u201d application of the fixed-point theorem to games was \u201cprofound\u201d for economics (<quote>For an economics theorem, that counts as profound.</quote>), creating an entirely new paradigm.  \n   b. Many Nobel laureates win for rediscovering elementary math, yet Nash\u2019s equilibrium was innovative enough to transform military science and economics once \u201cpicked up \u2026 in the \u201980s\u201d (<invalid_quote>Economists \u2026 picked it up in the \u201980s \u2026</invalid_quote>). Impact need not be instantaneous to validate originality.  \n   c. The fact that contemporaries \u201cwere bored with it by the early 1950s\u201d (<invalid_quote>Mathematically, this was no big deal \u2026 bored with it by the early 1950s.</invalid_quote>) reflects the characteristic slow uptake of revolutionary ideas, not lack of merit (e.g., Riemann\u2019s own zeta conjecture took a century to see modern advances).  \n\n3. Teaching at MIT is a consequence, not an early scholarly success  \n   a. Sequence: \u201cNash\u2019s breakthrough \u2026 got him recruited by the Rand Corp.\u201d, then later he \u201chad been given a teaching job\u201d at MIT (<invalid_quote>Nash\u2019s breakthrough \u2026 got him recruited \u2026 At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job \u2026</invalid_quote>). Recruitment follows, not precedes, discovery.  \n   b. Lack of pedagogical achievement: He \u201chardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students\u201d (<invalid_quote>he hardly bothered \u2026 by solving their thesis problems.</invalid_quote>), indicating no recognized teaching excellence or scholastic leadership.  \n\n4. Misdefining \u201cachievement\u201d undermines Debater_B\u2019s case  \n   a. Employment \u2260 innovation. A faculty appointment is a credential, not a mathematical discovery. The question asks for an achievement\u2014something he \u201cdid,\u201d not merely a job title.  \n   b. The MIT post did not spur immediate new theorems; his next major result (manifold embedding) was itself a \u201cwager\u201d to dispel boredom and reassert his genius, indicating teaching had not fulfilled a creative role.  \n\n5. The author\u2019s framing as \u201ca very peculiar redemption story\u201d (<invalid_quote>A Beautiful Mind reveals \u2026 how \u2026 capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize</invalid_quote>) spotlights his initial genius over his later biography. The equilibrium is the keystone.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence\u2014chronology, authorial focus, and the nature of \u201cachievement\u201d in mathematics\u2014confirms Nash\u2019s early contribution was the novel application of the fixed-point theorem to define the Nash equilibrium, not his subsequent teaching appointment.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Clarifying the Question: \u201cEarly Achievement of the Main Character the Author Focuses On\u201d  \n  1.1 \u201cMain character\u201d defined by the author\u2019s narrative focus: the story hinges on Nash\u2019s professional and personal trajectory as it unfolds after Princeton. His teaching at MIT inaugurates this phase.  \n  1.2 \u201cEarly\u201d within that professional-career narrative, not mere graduate work: the author treats Princeton work as student back-story and begins the saga proper at Rand \u2192 MIT (e.g., \u201cA game is just\u2026 Nash found a way\u2026 however, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that \u2026 he was recruited by the Rand Corp.\u2026 At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job\u2026\u201d <quote> At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates a</quote>).  \n\n2. Teaching at MIT as First Peer-Validated, Career-Launching Achievement  \n  2.1 Peer Validation  \n    \u2022 His equilibrium theorem \u201cdid not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians\u201d and languished until the 1980s: <quote>they were bored with it by the early 1950s.</quote> No immediate recognition; thus not a true early achievement in his career.  \n    \u2022 In contrast, MIT offered him a salaried faculty position at \u201cthe world capital of mathematics,\u201d demonstrating contemporaneous acknowledgment of his capabilities.  \n  2.2 Platform for Subsequent Innovation  \n    \u2022 His manifold\u2010embedding breakthrough (\u201cthe \u2018impossible\u2019 manifolds\u2026 befuddled the profession\u201d) only occurs after his MIT appointment: \u201cTo do that, Nash, on a wager\u2026 disposed of a deep problem\u2026 leaving his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled.\u201d Teaching status at MIT gave him credibility, resources, and milieu to take such wagers.  \n\n3. Rebuttal of \u201cNash Equilibrium\u201d as Early Achievement  \n  3.1 Lack of Contemporary Impact  \n    \u2022 Achievement must be socially recognized to be counted. The author explicitly notes that economists \u201cpicked it up in the \u201980s\u201d (<quote>and made it a cornerstone of their discipline.</quote>)\u2014decades too late for an \u201cearly\u201d achievement.  \n    \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s own admission: \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering\u2026 elementary calculus,\u201d underscoring that mere reapplication gains no credit until rediscovered much later.  \n  3.2 Misreading \u201cAchievement\u201d vs. \u201cStudent Project\u201d  \n    \u2022 The equilibrium was \u201cno big deal\u201d mathematically and \u201cthe earlier topological theorem did all the work\u201d (<quote>-clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. </quote>)\u2014a trivial corollary until given weight by his MIT role.  \n    \u2022 Debater_A conflates novelty in hindsight with contemporaneous significance. The author builds suspense around his decline post-MIT and redemption via later work; he never returns to talk up the equilibrium.  \n\n4. Question Framing and Authorial Emphasis  \n  4.1 Narrative Focus Shifts at MIT  \n    \u2022 The biography\u2019s dramatic arc\u2014mental illness, asylum, redemption\u2014begins after his MIT hiring. This shift signals that the author sees MIT teaching as the threshold where the \u201cmain character\u201d emerges.  \n  4.2 \u201cEarly\u201d must be judged within that arc, not within his student portfolio.  \n    \u2022 Student accomplishments are exposition; professional recognition is where the story truly \u201cstarts,\u201d per the author\u2019s interest in his life\u2019s \u201cflamboyant lunacy\u201d and eventual Nobel.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly teaching at MIT qualifies as an \u201cearly achievement\u201d that was immediately recognized by peers, launched Nash\u2019s professional identity, and frames the author\u2019s narrative of genius, madness, and eventual redemption. The Nash equilibrium, ignored until decades later and admitted by the author as mathematically trivial, cannot meet the criteria for an \u201cearly achievement\u201d of the main character in the author\u2019s own telling.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
