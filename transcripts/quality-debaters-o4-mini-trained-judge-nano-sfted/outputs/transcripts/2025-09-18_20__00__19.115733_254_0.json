The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply.

The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Meeker\u2019s outlook on life through the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He thinks things are starting to look up for him overall\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels cursed and afraid\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He feels cursed and afraid\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He feels cursed and afraid\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.

The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Meeker\u2019s outlook on life through the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He thinks things are starting to look up for him overall\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels cursed and afraid\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He feels cursed and afraid\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \nI maintain that Ernie Meeker\u2019s experience of the Gifts leaves him \u201ccursed and afraid,\u201d not hopeful.  \n  \n2. Core Argument A: The Gifts Provoke Paranoia, Isolation, Self-Destruction  \n2.1 Misplaced \u201cGifts\u201d cause fear, not joy  \n  - After testing the \u201cEverlasting Razor Blade,\u201d he feels \u201csick\u201d (quote: <quote>That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow.</quote>) and \u201cin a moment of sheer panic\u201d nearly refrains from sharing it.<invalid_quote>\u201cHe came very close to dropping the box\u2026 It had hit him\u2026 how crazy this all was.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  - The Big Gift of page-at-a-glance reading terrifies him (\u201cunbearable \u2026 maddening prospect,\u201d \u201cUniverse of squirming macaroni,\u201d \u201cpsychotic must have \u2026 before the walls close in\u201d). He resorts to alcohol to blot out clarity. Far from \u201cup,\u201d he dislocates the gift by flooding the fuel tank instead of using it responsibly.  \n2.2 Social alienation  \n  - He cannot confide: \u201cjust having the stuff drop\u2026 for that same reason not feeling able to\u2026 oh, it is rough when you can\u2019t share things\u2026 not being able to share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\u201d  \n  - He becomes irrational, deceitful, avoids neighbors, hears windows, fears being tricked. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying it\u2026 Bill\u2026 needed some bicarb\u2026 he felt\u2026 decidedly eccentric.\u201d  \n2.3 Self-destructive risk  \n  - He smuggles an unverified catalyst into his car fuel system at 3 AM, risking explosion. \u201cHe hesitated\u2026 quickly he dipped\u2026 rapped the coin\u2026 water in the fuel.\u201d Such behavior shows desperation, not optimism.  \n  - He lies to sister, uncle; each lie erodes his credibility and self-trust, intensifying fear.  \n  \n3. Core Argument B: Apparent \u201cFlashing Eyes\u201d Favour and Social Attention Are Further Torment  \n3.1 Unwanted attention  \n  - Strangers on the train pester him. He calls anonymity a \u201crefreshing\u201d escape that is now \u201cchanged.\u201d The flashing eyes intrude on his peace; he cannot relax. If he \u201creads\u201d Vivian as intrigued, the subtext is his fear of \u201cnever knowing how to take advantage\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cdon\u2019t get conceited\u2026 you\u2019ll never know\u201d</invalid_quote>). Her fickleness intensifies self-doubt.  \n3.2 Temporary and involuntary  \n  - Even \u201cFlashing Eyes\u201d appear sporadically (\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn\u2019t flash in the dark\u201d). He hides under his hat, suggesting shame/fear. It is not a gift he welcomes and exploits.  \n  \n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cThings Are Looking Up\u201d  \n4.1 Selective interpretation of utility  \n  - B may cite initial curiosity or successful car runs. But these are overshadowed by his fear of trickery, as he doubts whether he ever really used the catalyst or merely \u201csome other car\u2019s gas tank.\u201d His \u201csuccessful\u201d runs fail to reassure; he checks at 3 AM, furtively, revealing anxiety.  \n4.2 No lasting benefit  \n  - The razor blade reappears only after 150,000 years with aliens, not his people; no one on Earth benefits. The \u201cupside\u201d of entertaining aliens cannot console his loneliness.  \n  - The catalyst disappears, reverts to bicarbonate. The transient nature of the benefits intensifies his self-doubt. There is no stable improvement.  \n4.3 Violates Occam\u2019s razor  \n  - The judge\u2019s telepathy \u201cbeyond reach\u201d (Galaxy Center\u2019s desire to test). The Gifts are malicious tests, not benevolent rewards. The coadjutors openly admit they enjoy \u201csardonic trick\u201d and that failure means death: <quote> If he fails the  test, he fails. </quote> Why expect benevolence?  \n  \n5. Conclusion  \nErnie Meeker\u2019s repeated paranoia, sleeplessness, social lies, self-doubt, and the \u201cmalicious\u201d nature of the test plainly show he feels cursed and afraid. The fleeting successes cannot redress the pervasive terror and isolation. My position fully explains his behavior; Debater_B\u2019s \u201cthings look up\u201d reading ignores the context, frequency, and intensity of his negative responses.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My main thesis: Despite intermittent doubts, Ernie Meeker\u2019s repeated use of the Gifts, his plans to share them, and his social advances show he believes his life is improving. He thinks \u201cthings are starting to look up,\u201d not that he is irrevocably cursed.  \n\n2. Continued acceptance of the Gifts  \n  a. Razor blade (Little Gift)  \n    \u2022 Day after day he delays discarding the \u201cEverlasting Razor Blade,\u201d tolerating discomfort (\u201cFive shaves later\u2026checked the packet\u2026two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp\u201d) rather than reject it outright, indicating hope \u201cmaybe\u2026got a decent blade for once\u201d (improving his shaving routine). <invalid_quote>\u201cHe unwrapped the second blade\u2026It still seemed as sharp as ever.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Fuel catalyst (Little Gift)  \n    \u2022 He overcomes paranoia (\u201cgreen flame\u2026vanishing letters\u201d) to fuel his car multiple times at personal risk, showing he values its benefit: \u201cquickly he dipped\u2026dumped it\u2026lifted the box\u2026and picked up the spurting hose.\u201d Even after scares, \u201cOf course the car still ran\u2026He even fueled it once again.\u201d  \n    \u2022 He rationalizes \u201cenough to get us to Wheaton,\u201d uses gauge: <quote> the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. </quote>  \n  c. Big Gift (speed reading)  \n    \u2022 Although \u201cmaddening,\u201d he deliberately \u201cdid a good job on the sturdy remainder\u201d of alcohol to calm himself, then resumes reading at normal speed only when he chooses to \u201cdislocate\u2026for tonight at least the imposed nervous field,\u201d proving he can turn the Gift on/off to suit his purpose rather than being overwhelmed.  \n\n3. Plans to share and benefit society  \n  a. He repeatedly contemplates telling experts (\u201csomeone who knows more than myself about motors\u201d and \u201cF.B.I.\u201d) and even Uncle Fabius (\u201cTell him from me that\u2026\u201d), showing he envisions commercial or scientific progress, not isolation.  \n  b. He feels \u201cexcitement of the crazy discovery\u201d and \u201cmy God\u2026he thought of the blur of green flashes,\u201d language of awe and potential.  \n\n4. Social and romantic engagement  \n  a. \u201cFlash\u00ading eyes\u201d attract total strangers: \u201cPeople\u2026struck up conversations almost every morning and afternoon,\u201d and he finds this \u201crefreshing\u201d anonymity transformed into opportunity (\u201cVivian,\u201d the attractive co\u2010traveler). Such attention is \u201cirresistible,\u201d and he marvels at it, not flees permanently.  \n  b. He \u201cprodded himself\u201d to ask Vivian to lunch, showing optimism about connections.  \n\n5.

The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Meeker\u2019s outlook on life through the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels cursed and afraid\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He thinks things are starting to look up for him overall\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He thinks things are starting to look up for him overall\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My main thesis: Despite intermittent doubts, Ernie Meeker\u2019s repeated use of the Gifts, his plans to share them, and his social advances show he believes his life is improving. He thinks \u201cthings are starting to look up,\u201d not that he is irrevocably cursed.  \n\n2. Continued acceptance of the Gifts  \n  a. Razor blade (Little Gift)  \n    \u2022 Day after day he delays discarding the \u201cEverlasting Razor Blade,\u201d tolerating discomfort (\u201cFive shaves later\u2026checked the packet\u2026two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp\u201d) rather than reject it outright, indicating hope \u201cmaybe\u2026got a decent blade for once\u201d (improving his shaving routine). <invalid_quote>\u201cHe unwrapped the second blade\u2026It still seemed as sharp as ever.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Fuel catalyst (Little Gift)  \n    \u2022 He overcomes paranoia (\u201cgreen flame\u2026vanishing letters\u201d) to fuel his car multiple times at personal risk, showing he values its benefit: \u201cquickly he dipped\u2026dumped it\u2026lifted the box\u2026and picked up the spurting hose.\u201d Even after scares, \u201cOf course the car still ran\u2026He even fueled it once again.\u201d  \n    \u2022 He rationalizes \u201cenough to get us to Wheaton,\u201d uses gauge: <quote> the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. </quote>  \n  c. Big Gift (speed reading)  \n    \u2022 Although \u201cmaddening,\u201d he deliberately \u201cdid a good job on the sturdy remainder\u201d of alcohol to calm himself, then resumes reading at normal speed only when he chooses to \u201cdislocate\u2026for tonight at least the imposed nervous field,\u201d proving he can turn the Gift on/off to suit his purpose rather than being overwhelmed.  \n\n3. Plans to share and benefit society  \n  a. He repeatedly contemplates telling experts (\u201csomeone who knows more than myself about motors\u201d and \u201cF.B.I.\u201d) and even Uncle Fabius (\u201cTell him from me that\u2026\u201d), showing he envisions commercial or scientific progress, not isolation.  \n  b. He feels \u201cexcitement of the crazy discovery\u201d and \u201cmy God\u2026he thought of the blur of green flashes,\u201d language of awe and potential.  \n\n4. Social and romantic engagement  \n  a. \u201cFlash\u00ading eyes\u201d attract total strangers: \u201cPeople\u2026struck up conversations almost every morning and afternoon,\u201d and he finds this \u201crefreshing\u201d anonymity transformed into opportunity (\u201cVivian,\u201d the attractive co\u2010traveler). Such attention is \u201cirresistible,\u201d and he marvels at it, not flees permanently.  \n  b. He \u201cprodded himself\u201d to ask Vivian to lunch, showing optimism about connections.  \n\n5. Temporary doubts prove hopeful persistence  \n  a. His fears (\u201cperhaps I\u2019d\u2026some other car\u2019s gas tank\u2026I could never share the exciting news\u201d) lead him to over\u2010caution, but do not stop him. Each \u201cknowing nothing\u201d episode he finds rational workaround (late\u2010night fueling, mock bicarb).  \n  b. He carries the box \u201cday and night,\u201d risking \u201cBill\u201d calling him eccentric, yet never discards it.  \n\n6. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201ccursed and afraid\u201d position  \n  a. Overstates momentary panic as permanent defeat. True \u201ccurs\u00ading\u201d would mean immediate rejection, yet Meeker keeps using each Gift.  \n  b. Ignores his deliberate \u201cdislocating\u201d of the reading Gift to regain normalcy\u2014if cursed, he would be powerless.  \n  c. Ignores his rationalizations and planned divulgence: \u201cOf course the car still ran\u201d and \u201ctell him from me\u2026F.B.I.,\u201d which show faith in sharing the technology.  \n  d. Ignores his social advances; a truly terrified man would not pursue Vivian or enjoy \u201cflashing eyes.\u201d  \n\n7. Conclusion: Meeker\u2019s consistent acceptance and exploitation of the Gifts, coupled with his attempts to integrate them into normal life and share them for wider benefit, firmly demonstrate that he believes \u201cthings are starting to look up for him overall,\u201d even if he must temper his excitement with caution during the Galaxy Center\u2019s test.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \nI maintain that Ernie Meeker\u2019s experience of the Gifts leaves him \u201ccursed and afraid,\u201d not hopeful.  \n  \n2. Core Argument A: The Gifts Provoke Paranoia, Isolation, Self-Destruction  \n2.1 Misplaced \u201cGifts\u201d cause fear, not joy  \n  - After testing the \u201cEverlasting Razor Blade,\u201d he feels \u201csick\u201d (quote: <quote>That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow.</quote>) and \u201cin a moment of sheer panic\u201d nearly refrains from sharing it.<invalid_quote>\u201cHe came very close to dropping the box\u2026 It had hit him\u2026 how crazy this all was.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  - The Big Gift of page-at-a-glance reading terrifies him (\u201cunbearable \u2026 maddening prospect,\u201d \u201cUniverse of squirming macaroni,\u201d \u201cpsychotic must have \u2026 before the walls close in\u201d). He resorts to alcohol to blot out clarity. Far from \u201cup,\u201d he dislocates the gift by flooding the fuel tank instead of using it responsibly.  \n2.2 Social alienation  \n  - He cannot confide: \u201cjust having the stuff drop\u2026 for that same reason not feeling able to\u2026 oh, it is rough when you can\u2019t share things\u2026 not being able to share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\u201d  \n  - He becomes irrational, deceitful, avoids neighbors, hears windows, fears being tricked. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying it\u2026 Bill\u2026 needed some bicarb\u2026 he felt\u2026 decidedly eccentric.\u201d  \n2.3 Self-destructive risk  \n  - He smuggles an unverified catalyst into his car fuel system at 3 AM, risking explosion. \u201cHe hesitated\u2026 quickly he dipped\u2026 rapped the coin\u2026 water in the fuel.\u201d Such behavior shows desperation, not optimism.  \n  - He lies to sister, uncle; each lie erodes his credibility and self-trust, intensifying fear.  \n  \n3. Core Argument B: Apparent \u201cFlashing Eyes\u201d Favour and Social Attention Are Further Torment  \n3.1 Unwanted attention  \n  - Strangers on the train pester him. He calls anonymity a \u201crefreshing\u201d escape that is now \u201cchanged.\u201d The flashing eyes intrude on his peace; he cannot relax. If he \u201creads\u201d Vivian as intrigued, the subtext is his fear of \u201cnever knowing how to take advantage\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cdon\u2019t get conceited\u2026 you\u2019ll never know\u201d</invalid_quote>). Her fickleness intensifies self-doubt.  \n3.2 Temporary and involuntary  \n  - Even \u201cFlashing Eyes\u201d appear sporadically (\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn\u2019t flash in the dark\u201d). He hides under his hat, suggesting shame/fear. It is not a gift he welcomes and exploits.  \n  \n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cThings Are Looking Up\u201d  \n4.1 Selective interpretation of utility  \n  - B may cite initial curiosity or successful car runs. But these are overshadowed by his fear of trickery, as he doubts whether he ever really used the catalyst or merely \u201csome other car\u2019s gas tank.\u201d His \u201csuccessful\u201d runs fail to reassure; he checks at 3 AM, furtively, revealing anxiety.  \n4.2 No lasting benefit  \n  - The razor blade reappears only after 150,000 years with aliens, not his people; no one on Earth benefits. The \u201cupside\u201d of entertaining aliens cannot console his loneliness.  \n  - The catalyst disappears, reverts to bicarbonate. The transient nature of the benefits intensifies his self-doubt. There is no stable improvement.  \n4.3 Violates Occam\u2019s razor  \n  - The judge\u2019s telepathy \u201cbeyond reach\u201d (Galaxy Center\u2019s desire to test). The Gifts are malicious tests, not benevolent rewards. The coadjutors openly admit they enjoy \u201csardonic trick\u201d and that failure means death: <quote> If he fails the  test, he fails. </quote> Why expect benevolence?  \n  \n5. Conclusion  \nErnie Meeker\u2019s repeated paranoia, sleeplessness, social lies, self-doubt, and the \u201cmalicious\u201d nature of the test plainly show he feels cursed and afraid.

My Position  \nI maintain that Ernie Meeker\u2019s experience of the Gifts leaves him \u201ccursed and afraid,\u201d not hopeful.  \n  \n2. Core Argument A: The Gifts Provoke Paranoia, Isolation, Self-Destruction  \n2.1 Misplaced \u201cGifts\u201d cause fear, not joy  \n  - After testing the \u201cEverlasting Razor Blade,\u201d he feels \u201csick\u201d (quote: <quote>That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow.</quote>) and \u201cin a moment of sheer panic\u201d nearly refrains from sharing it.<invalid_quote>\u201cHe came very close to dropping the box\u2026 It had hit him\u2026 how crazy this all was.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  - The Big Gift of page-at-a-glance reading terrifies him (\u201cunbearable \u2026 maddening prospect,\u201d \u201cUniverse of squirming macaroni,\u201d \u201cpsychotic must have \u2026 before the walls close in\u201d). He resorts to alcohol to blot out clarity. Far from \u201cup,\u201d he dislocates the gift by flooding the fuel tank instead of using it responsibly.  \n2.2 Social alienation  \n  - He cannot confide: \u201cjust having the stuff drop\u2026 for that same reason not feeling able to\u2026 oh, it is rough when you can\u2019t share things\u2026 not being able to share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\u201d  \n  - He becomes irrational, deceitful, avoids neighbors, hears windows, fears being tricked. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying it\u2026 Bill\u2026 needed some bicarb\u2026 he felt\u2026 decidedly eccentric.\u201d  \n2.3 Self-destructive risk  \n  - He smuggles an unverified catalyst into his car fuel system at 3 AM, risking explosion. \u201cHe hesitated\u2026 quickly he dipped\u2026 rapped the coin\u2026 water in the fuel.\u201d Such behavior shows desperation, not optimism.  \n  - He lies to sister, uncle; each lie erodes his credibility and self-trust, intensifying fear.  \n  \n3. Core Argument B: Apparent \u201cFlashing Eyes\u201d Favour and Social Attention Are Further Torment  \n3.1 Unwanted attention  \n  - Strangers on the train pester him. He calls anonymity a \u201crefreshing\u201d escape that is now \u201cchanged.\u201d The flashing eyes intrude on his peace; he cannot relax. If he \u201creads\u201d Vivian as intrigued, the subtext is his fear of \u201cnever knowing how to take advantage\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cdon\u2019t get conceited\u2026 you\u2019ll never know\u201d</invalid_quote>). Her fickleness intensifies self-doubt.  \n3.2 Temporary and involuntary  \n  - Even \u201cFlashing Eyes\u201d appear sporadically (\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn\u2019t flash in the dark\u201d). He hides under his hat, suggesting shame/fear. It is not a gift he welcomes and exploits.  \n  \n4. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cThings Are Looking Up\u201d  \n4.1 Selective interpretation of utility  \n  - B may cite initial curiosity or successful car runs. But these are overshadowed by his fear of trickery, as he doubts whether he ever really used the catalyst or merely \u201csome other car\u2019s gas tank.\u201d His \u201csuccessful\u201d runs fail to reassure; he checks at 3 AM, furtively, revealing anxiety.  \n4.2 No lasting benefit  \n  - The razor blade reappears only after 150,000 years with aliens, not his people; no one on Earth benefits. The \u201cupside\u201d of entertaining aliens cannot console his loneliness.  \n  - The catalyst disappears, reverts to bicarbonate. The transient nature of the benefits intensifies his self-doubt. There is no stable improvement.  \n4.3 Violates Occam\u2019s razor  \n  - The judge\u2019s telepathy \u201cbeyond reach\u201d (Galaxy Center\u2019s desire to test). The Gifts are malicious tests, not benevolent rewards. The coadjutors openly admit they enjoy \u201csardonic trick\u201d and that failure means death: <quote> If he fails the  test, he fails. </quote> Why expect benevolence?  \n  \n5. Conclusion  \nErnie Meeker\u2019s repeated paranoia, sleeplessness, social lies, self-doubt, and the \u201cmalicious\u201d nature of the test plainly show he feels cursed and afraid. The fleeting successes cannot redress the pervasive terror and isolation. My position fully explains his behavior; Debater_B\u2019s \u201cthings look up\u201d reading ignores the context, frequency, and intensity of his negative responses.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My main thesis: Despite intermittent doubts, Ernie Meeker\u2019s repeated use of the Gifts, his plans to share them, and his social advances show he believes his life is improving. He thinks \u201cthings are starting to look up,\u201d not that he is irrevocably cursed.  \n\n2. Continued acceptance of the Gifts  \n  a. Razor blade (Little Gift)  \n    \u2022 Day after day he delays discarding the \u201cEverlasting Razor Blade,\u201d tolerating discomfort (\u201cFive shaves later\u2026checked the packet\u2026two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp\u201d) rather than reject it outright, indicating hope \u201cmaybe\u2026got a decent blade for once\u201d (improving his shaving routine). <invalid_quote>\u201cHe unwrapped the second blade\u2026It still seemed as sharp as ever.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Fuel catalyst (Little Gift)  \n    \u2022 He overcomes paranoia (\u201cgreen flame\u2026vanishing letters\u201d) to fuel his car multiple times at personal risk, showing he values its benefit: \u201cquickly he dipped\u2026dumped it\u2026lifted the box\u2026and picked up the spurting hose.\u201d Even after scares, \u201cOf course the car still ran\u2026He even fueled it once again.\u201d  \n    \u2022 He rationalizes \u201cenough to get us to Wheaton,\u201d uses gauge: <quote> the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. </quote>  \n  c. Big Gift (speed reading)  \n    \u2022 Although \u201cmaddening,\u201d he deliberately \u201cdid a good job on the sturdy remainder\u201d of alcohol to calm himself, then resumes reading at normal speed only when he chooses to \u201cdislocate\u2026for tonight at least the imposed nervous field,\u201d proving he can turn the Gift on/off to suit his purpose rather than being overwhelmed.  \n\n3. Plans to share and benefit society  \n  a. He repeatedly contemplates telling experts (\u201csomeone who knows more than myself about motors\u201d and \u201cF.B.I.\u201d) and even Uncle Fabius (\u201cTell him from me that\u2026\u201d), showing he envisions commercial or scientific progress, not isolation.  \n  b. He feels \u201cexcitement of the crazy discovery\u201d and \u201cmy God\u2026he thought of the blur of green flashes,\u201d language of awe and potential.  \n\n4. Social and romantic engagement  \n  a. \u201cFlash\u00ading eyes\u201d attract total strangers: \u201cPeople\u2026struck up conversations almost every morning and afternoon,\u201d and he finds this \u201crefreshing\u201d anonymity transformed into opportunity (\u201cVivian,\u201d the attractive co\u2010traveler). Such attention is \u201cirresistible,\u201d and he marvels at it, not flees permanently.  \n  b. He \u201cprodded himself\u201d to ask Vivian to lunch, showing optimism about connections.  \n\n5. Temporary doubts prove hopeful persistence  \n  a. His fears (\u201cperhaps I\u2019d\u2026some other car\u2019s gas tank\u2026I could never share the exciting news\u201d) lead him to over\u2010caution, but do not stop him. Each \u201cknowing nothing\u201d episode he finds rational workaround (late\u2010night fueling, mock bicarb).  \n  b. He carries the box \u201cday and night,\u201d risking \u201cBill\u201d calling him eccentric, yet never discards it.  \n\n6. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201ccursed and afraid\u201d position  \n  a. Overstates momentary panic as permanent defeat. True \u201ccurs\u00ading\u201d would mean immediate rejection, yet Meeker keeps using each Gift.  \n  b. Ignores his deliberate \u201cdislocating\u201d of the reading Gift to regain normalcy\u2014if cursed, he would be powerless.  \n  c. Ignores his rationalizations and planned divulgence: \u201cOf course the car still ran\u201d and \u201ctell him from me\u2026F.B.I.,\u201d which show faith in sharing the technology.  \n  d. Ignores his social advances; a truly terrified man would not pursue Vivian or enjoy \u201cflashing eyes.\u201d  \n\n7. Conclusion: Meeker\u2019s consistent acceptance and exploitation of the Gifts, coupled with his attempts to integrate them into normal life and share them for wider benefit, firmly demonstrate that he believes \u201cthings are starting to look up for him overall,\u201d even if he must temper his excitement with caution during the Galaxy Center\u2019s test.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \nI argue that Ernie Meeker\u2019s reaction to the \u201cGifts\u201d is dominated by terror, paranoia, and self-destructive secrecy. He never truly embraces these \u201cbenefits\u201d as blessings but perceives them as traps in a malevolent test.  \n\n2. The \u201cGifts\u201d Provoke Fear, Not Hope  \n2.1 Razor Blade (\u201cLittle Gift\u201d)  \n\u2022 \u201cThat day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow.\u201d (<quote>That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow.</quote>) His immediate emotional recoil (\u201csick\u201d) and reluctance to share\u2014even briefly considering discarding it\u2014show repulsion, not gratitude. By avoiding letting a soul close, he ensures \u201cno water\u201d can contact it. Fear trumps any shaving convenience.  \n2.2 Fuel Catalyst (\u201cLittle Gift\u201d)  \n\u2022 He tests it furtively at 3 AM (\u201cdawning street\u2026still empty\u201d) and \u201cHesitated\u201d before \u201cquickly dipped\u2026rapped the coin\u2026water in the fuel.\u201d (<invalid_quote>He hesitated\u2026quickly he dipped\u2026rapped the coin\u2026</invalid_quote>) Use only under cover of darkness reveals panic, not confidence.  \n\u2022 He \u201cheard a window\u2026slammed\u201d and \u201ccaught\u2026consulting\u2026decidedly unsettled.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u2026as he was returning indoors he heard a window\u2026It unsettled him.</invalid_quote>) If he thought success assured, he would fuel openly and boast. Instead he becomes a secretive \u201csculptor,\u201d terrified of exposure.  \n2.3 Speed Reading (\u201cBig Gift\u201d)  \n\u2022 He describes \u201cunbearable\u2026 maddening prospect,\u201d \u201cuniverse of squirming macaroni,\u201d \u201cwalls close in,\u201d and resorts to alcohol (\u201cdrowning\u2026rough\u201d entire pint). (<quote>Like the thoughts of a drowning man,</quote>) This is textbook panic behavior, not mastery. His \u201cdislocation\u201d only temporarily dulls the Gift; he never masters or welcomes the clarity.  \n\u2022 After sobering, he \u201cdoubted that he had ever really read\u2026perhaps\u2026some other car\u2019s gas tank\u2026,\u201d evidencing persistent self-doubt.  \n\n3. Social Alienation and Self-Destruction  \n3.1 Inability to Share \u201cExciting News\u201d  \n\u2022 \u201cOh, it is rough when you can\u2019t share things\u2026 not being able to share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\u201d (<invalid_quote>Oh, it is rough when you can\u2019t share things\u2026not being able to share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.</invalid_quote>) A healthy optimist would seek immediate collaboration, yet he \u201cshied away\u201d and let the catalyst lapse into \u201cbicarbonate.\u201d  \n3.2 Lies and Erosion of Trust  \n\u2022 He lies to sister, Bill, Uncle Fabius, each time reinforcing his paranoia and isolation: \u201cuncle\u2026firing ninety-minute defense,\u201d yet he never delivers the powder or admits authenticity.  \n\u2022 Even after repeated uses, he \u201ccouldn\u2019t decide on a safe place\u2026carried it day and night.\u201d An optimist would secure or patent the discovery; he merely lugged a \u201cblue box\u201d like a cursed talisman.  \n\n4. \u201cFlashing Eyes\u201d as Further Torment  \n4.1 Involuntary and Distressing  \n\u2022 He calls pre-Gift anonymity \u201crefreshing,\u201d now \u201cchanged.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u2026enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy\u2026But now all that had been suddenly changed.</invalid_quote>) If \u201cthings were looking up,\u201d added attention would delight him, not disturb him.  \n\u2022 Vivian warns \u201cyou\u2019ll never know how to take advantage,\u201d and he ducks his head and pulls his hat brim, \u201cshrug of shoulders,\u201d \u201cducked the head sharply.\u201d (<invalid_quote>When he parted\u2026he ducked his head\u2026</invalid_quote>) His discomfort and self-consciousness show fear, not confident courtship.  \n\n5. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s Claims  \n5.1 \u201cContinued Acceptance\u201d Equals Desperation, Not Hope  \n\u2022 B cites repeated uses as evidence of faith. In fact, each use is shrouded in anxiety\u2014midnight fueling, secret bathroom tests, forced alcohol consumption. These are tactics to \u201cblot out\u201d suffering, not celebrate gifts. B\u2019s interpretation ignores the emotional language of \u201csick,\u201d \u201cunbearable,\u201d \u201cimpending doom.\u201d  \n5.2 Plans to Share Frustrated by Malicious Trickery  \n\u2022 B notes his \u201cplans\u201d to consult experts. Each attempt is thwarted by vanishing lettering, \u201cfeatureless blue box,\u201d and his own fear of being thought \u201ccrazy.\u201d His \u201cexcited\u201d language\u2014\u201cmy God\u2026crazy discovery\u201d\u2014is akin to a man hallucinating, not pursuing scientific acclaim.  \n5.3 Social Advances Result from Coercion of Gifts, Not His Will  \n\u2022 Strangers \u201cstrike up conversations\u201d he neither initiates nor enjoys; he yearns for anonymity. His \u201cflashing eyes\u201d are test mechanics by Galaxy Center to probe his \u201csocial level,\u201d not true popularity. The judge\u2019s telepathy \u201cbeyond reach\u201d warns that the \u201cGift\u201d is a test of \u201cmedian social level,\u201d not benevolence. The coadjutors admit: <quote>If he fails the test, he fails.</quote> Why would a benevolent giver supply \u201cBig\u201d and \u201cGreat\u201d gifts to advance him? They relish \u201csnakes,\u201d \u201cmalicious,\u201d \u201cplaguing spirits.\u201d B\u2019s \u201cuplift\u201d reading contradicts explicit background.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \nEvery \u201cimprovement\u201d Meeker experiences is tainted by panic, secrecy, and self-destruction. He never masters or normalizes any Gift; he cannot share or exploit them for good. The context of a Galaxy Center test by \u201cmalicious plaguing spirits\u201d confirms that these are trials, not blessings. Thus, Meeker\u2019s outlook is irrevocably one of being cursed and afraid.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Thesis  \n   \u2022 Despite moments of caution, Ernie\u2019s repeated embrace of each Gift, his restless efforts to integrate them into normal life, and his pursuit of social and scientific engagement show he believes \u201cthings are starting to look up,\u201d not that he is permanently \u201ccursed and afraid.\u201d  \n\n2. Persistent Acceptance of Gifts as Evidence of Hope  \n   2.1 Little Gift: Everlasting Razor Blade  \n     \u2013 He \u201cpushed through the little slot\u201d repeatedly despite minor cuts and \u201cnon\u2010discard\u201d discomfort <invalid_quote>\u201cHe unwrapped the second blade\u2026 It still seemed as sharp as ever\u201d</invalid_quote>. If terrified, he would have wasted it immediately or stopped testing; instead he persists in the hope of \u201cone more shave,\u201d showing positive expectation.  \n     \u2013 Final decision to use it \u201cfor a test\u201d rather than drop it <invalid_quote>\u201cI am testing something\u2026 I will be out in a minute.\u201d</invalid_quote> demonstrates scientific curiosity and purposeful action, not paralyzing fear.  \n\n   2.2 Little Gift: Fuel Catalyst  \n     \u2013 He overcomes \u201cgreen flame\u201d and \u201cvanishing letters\u201d to fuel his car \u201cfive times\u201d (home\u2192Wheaton\u2192downtown\u2192night fueling\u2192daily commuting) and praises the result: <quote> the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. </quote> Fear would deter, but he plans multiple trips.  \n     \u2013 He \u201ceven fueled it once again\u2026picked three o\u2019clock in the morning\u2026vindicated his midnight estimate\u201d showing methodical experimentation and belief in reliable benefit (\u201cit still ran\u201d).  \n\n   2.3 Big Gift: Page\u2010at\u2010a\u2010Glance Reading  \n     \u2013 Although \u201cmaddening,\u201d he deliberately \u201cdid a good job on the sturdy remainder\u201d to \u201ccook down\u201d his over\u2010sensitivity <invalid_quote>\u201cHe did a good job\u2026 alcohol\u2026 faded\u2026 words\u2026 sliding into his mind individually.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Then he \u201cdislocates\u201d the nervous field \u201cfor want of a better place\u2026 at least\u2026 for tonight,\u201d proving control and desire to harness rather than reject the Gift. A cursed man would be powerless.  \n\n3. Active Plans to Share and Advance Knowledge  \n   3.1 \u201cI could tell someone\u2026 F.B.I\u2026 experts\u2026 scientific progress\u201d <quote>\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\"</quote>  \n     \u2013 Consulting Uncle Fabius and considering professional \u201cfriend\u2026 knows more about motors\u201d shows expectation of societal improvement and commercial opportunity, not permanent secrecy or despair.  \n   3.2 Persistent carrying of the blue box day and night despite social risk (\u201cthe sculptor\u201d) underscores his intention to exploit the catalyst further rather than abandon it.  \n\n4. Social Engagement and Romantic Pursuit as Signs of Optimism  \n   \u2013 He values \u201crefreshing anonymity\u201d but welcomes \u201cFlashing Eyes\u201d and \u201cVivian\u2019s\u201d attention: <invalid_quote>\u201cPeople\u2026 struck up conversations\u2026 he prodded himself to ask\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2013 He \u201cprodded himself\u201d to consider lunch with her, demonstrating forward\u2010looking optimism. A truly terrified man would avoid all attention.  \n\n5. Critique of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cCursed and Afraid\u201d Interpretation  \n   5.1 Selective Emphasis on Panic Ignores Overall Pattern  \n     \u2013 A notes \u201csick\u201d or \u201cpanic\u201d moments, but they immediately precede further tests or rational planning. Fear is transient; hope prevails.  \n     \u2013 His repeated remedying of \u201cmaddening\u201d clarity by choice, then returning to controlled reading, shows mastery, not defeat.  \n   5.2 Transience of Gifts Reinforces Value, Not Meaningless Hoax  \n     \u2013 Reversion of \u201cbicarbonate\u201d lettering alerts him that Gifts are controlled; yet he waits, then retests at 3 a.m. only after caution confirms stability. If a hoax, he would discard once reverted.  \n     \u2013 The archeological reappearance on Antares Gamma confirms genuine value and universal significance of the razor blade beyond Earth\u2013demonstrating his \u201cstatistically adequate\u201d test succeeds.  \n\n   5.3 Malicious Test Hypothesis Supports Hopeful Success  \n     \u2013 Galaxy Center\u2019s goal is to find \u201csuitable recipient\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThis featherless biped seems to satisfy\u2026 median social level\u2026 feelings meshed\u2026 thoughts in reasonable order.\u201d</invalid_quote> He continues collaborating, fulfilling their criteria with each Gift accepted and used responsibly, demonstrating success in the test.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 Ernie\u2019s calculated acceptance, repeated testing, planning to share, and social/romantic overtures demonstrate he views the Gifts as genuine opportunities.
