WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it.

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did the spy enter the Project?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted to test human travel safety Outside\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted to gain information about the technologies in the Project\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He wanted to gain information about the technologies in the Project\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He wanted to gain information about the technologies in the Project\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cTesting Outside Safety\u201d (My Position)\n\n1.  \u201cNo Radiation Shield\u201d Evidence  \n    a.  \u201cI came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to protect me.\u201d (<quote>p.

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did the spy enter the Project?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted to gain information about the technologies in the Project\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted to test human travel safety Outside\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He wanted to test human travel safety Outside\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He wanted to test human travel safety Outside\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_A", "content": "Argument for Technological Espionage (Debater_A\u2019s Position)\n\n1.

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did the spy enter the Project?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted to test human travel safety Outside\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted to gain information about the technologies in the Project\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He wanted to gain information about the technologies in the Project\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Debater_A\u2019s Position: \u201cSpy\u2019s Goal Was Technological Intelligence Gathering\u201d  \n1. Direct Evidence of Technical Interest  \n  a. \u201cI\u2019m a trained atomic engineer \u2026 In my project, I worked on the reactor.\u201d  \n     \u2022 He identifies himself by profession (<quote>\"I'm a trained atomic engineer,</quote>), emphasizing his technical background.  \n     \u2022 Engineers customarily seek new information and improvements, not mere travel.  \n  b. \u201cHe plugged in the manual controls. We can\u2019t control the elevator from outside at all.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe jammed it between floors \u2026 He plugged in the manual controls\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2022 He subverts the Project\u2019s force-screen and control systems, showing detailed knowledge of elevator mechanisms.  \n     \u2022 Only someone desiring hands-on access to proprietary machinery would endure the risk and delay of such sabotage.  \n2. Risk Profile Incompatible with \u201cSafety Testing\u201d  \n  a. Deliberate Exposure: He enters via unguarded stairway rather than the compromised elevator (<quote> I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,</quote>).  \n     \u2022 If Outside were truly safe (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe radiation level \u2026 is practically as low as it was before the Atom War\u201d</invalid_quote>), he would have used the elevator or de-radiated ore-sleds.  \n     \u2022 Instead, he prefers obscure, dusty stairs \u2013 characteristic of clandestine ingress.  \n  b. Endangering Hostages: He holds Rice hostage for extended \u201cwaiting out\u201d period (<quote> We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes </quote>)  \n     \u2022 A traveler prioritizing his own survival would not endanger innocent lives or linger.  \n     \u2022 Intelligence agents accept collateral risk while awaiting cover to exfiltrate with captured data or equipment.  \n3. Explicit Motive to Displace the Project Regime  \n  a. \u201cIf the Outside were safe and the Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe Commission was out of a job \u2026 they feared losing power\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2022 He frames Projects as archaic \u201ccaves.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Intelligence-gatherers often seek vulnerabilities to undermine or supplant regimes. His criticisms of \u201cfools\u201d and \u201cstupidity\u201d signal ideological motive to catalyze disintegration by revealing technical secrets.  \n4. Lack of Genuine \u201cReturn\u201d Intent  \n  a. No request for directions back Outside or use of resident\u2019s phone.  \n  b. His sole focus in dialogue is on Project defenses and reactor technology, not supplies or long-term lodging (<quote>\"You got  any chico coffee?\"</quote> is minimal sustenance).  \n  c. After waiting \u201cuntil the hue and cry passes,\u201d he plans only to tie up Rice and \u201cleave,\u201d implying he intends to infiltrate others\u2019 Projects later, not rejoin society by daylight.  \n5. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSafety Testing\u201d Theory  \n  a. Testing Already Prohibited: He \u201cwanted to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn\u2019t let me\u201d (<quote>and the Commission wouldn't let me.</quote>).  \n     \u2022 If returning home were his goal, he would choose stealth but not prolonged hostage-taking that increases exposure and broadcast threat signals that deter future travel.  \n  b. No Evidence of Sample Collection: A genuine safety tester would collect soil, radiation measurements, ore samples or biological evidence. No such containers or references appear.  \n  c. Hostile Reaction to Rescue Attempts: He aims to crush Army rescuers (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe runs it up and down the shaft, trying to crush anybody\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 A safety tester respects fellow humans and would welcome rescues; an intelligence agent treats opposing forces as threats to secrecy.  \nConclusion: The spy\u2019s behavior\u2014complex sabotage, technical dialogue, hostage-strategy, ideological rhetoric and rejection of rescue\u2014aligns conclusively with a clandestine mission to acquire and exploit the Project\u2019s advanced technologies, not a benign test of Outside safety.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTesting Outside Safety\u201d (My Position)\n\n1.  \u201cNo Radiation Shield\u201d Evidence  \n    a.  \u201cI came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to protect me.\u201d (<quote>p. And</quote>)  \n    b.  A spy whose mission is \u201cindustrial espionage\u201d or \u201ctechnology theft\u201d would require protective gear and a secure return path to preserve stolen samples. His unshielded journey shows his goal was empirical measurement of ambient radiation by personal survival.\n\n2.  Statements on Radiation Levels  \n    a.  He reports \u201cThe radiation level is practically as low as it was before the Atom War\u201d and estimates \u201cabout ten years\u201d of decline. (<quote>p. And</quote>)  \n    b.  If he merely wanted Project technologies, he would rely on instrumentation or ore-sled data. Instead, he depends on human survival time as an indicator, implying a hands-on test of Outside habitability.\n\n3.  Ideological Monologue on Human Progress  \n    a.  He contrasts \u201ccave\u201d life in Projects with the drive to \u201ctackle space,\u201d \u201cmoon,\u201d \u201cplanets,\u201d \u201cstars.\u201d (<quote>p. And</quote>)  \n    b.  He laments that \u201cMan got a hotfoot\u2026 ran all the way back to the cave\u201d and stresses \u201cWorld is safe out there now\u2026 can start building the dreams again.\u201d (<quote>p. And</quote>)  \n    c.  This utopian rhetoric is inconsistent with a mere spy\u2014he genuinely hopes to re-establish human expansion, not subvert Project industry.\n\n4.  Willingness to Befriend and Wait  \n    a.  He tolerates confinement in Rice\u2019s apartment rather than fleeing immediately with stolen data. He says he\u2019ll \u201ctie you up\u2026 then leave\u201d only after waiting \u201cuntil the hue and cry passes.\u201d (<quote>p. And</quote>)  \n    b.  A technology thief would aim for rapid entry and exfiltration. His patient caution suggests caution for personal survival rather than stealing perishable or detectable goods.\n\n5.  Lack of Technical Equipment  \n    a.  He carries only a hand gun and uses \u201cmanual controls\u201d to jam the elevator. No instruments, sample containers, or data-gathering tools are mentioned.  \n    b.  If \u201ctechnology theft\u201d were his objective, these omissions make no sense; the ore-sleds operate on simple robotics, nothing in the text indicates revolutionary equipment to steal that requires deep infiltration.\n\nObjections to \u201cTech Espionage\u201d (Debater_A\u2019s Position)\n\n1.  Absence of Direct Evidence of Theft  \n    a.  No mention of him handling or examining Project machinery, computers, or samples.  \n    b.  He engages Rice in idle conversation about ore-sled radiation clearance, not technical procedures; when Rice feigns ignorance or references \u201cclassified information,\u201d the spy ceases inquiry and instead emphasizes trust and leisure (coffee).\n\n2.  Unshielded Exposure Risk  \n    a.  Debater_A cannot explain why a saboteur would risk prolonged exposure to lethal levels to gather information that could be obtained via ore-sled sensors or brief probes.  \n    b.  His only stated scientific background is as \u201ctrained atomic engineer\u201d working \u201con the reactor\u201d in his own Project (<quote>p. And</quote>); his mission logic is self-test to verify safety, not data theft.\n\n3.  Monologue Emphasizes Altruism and Future Exploration  \n    a.  His emotional appeals to Rice invoke shared humanity, complaining that \u201cCommission\u201d suppresses research to protect its own bureaucracy. He frames his act as scientific freedom, not sabotage.  \n    b.  If theft, he would play spy\u2019s deceptions more subtly; instead, he reveals his motives when he gains Rice\u2019s confidence, further evidence of benign intentions toward humankind.\n\n4.  Post-Infiltration Behavior  \n    a.  He does not sabotage Project beyond jamming the elevator; he could disable force\u2010screens or traffic more severely were he a saboteur.  \n    b.

The \u201ctechnology theft\u201d theory fails to explain these facts and ignores his own confessions. Therefore, the spy\u2019s true motive was to check whether mankind could leave the \u201ccave\u201d of the Projects and resume its destiny of exploration.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He wanted to gain information about the technologies in the Project\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cTesting Outside Safety\u201d (My Position)\n\n1.\u2003Unshielded Trek as Empirical Radiation Test  \n  1.1\u2003\u201cI came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all\u2026\u201d (<quote> IN</quote>)  \n    \u2013 A genuine technology\u2010gathering spy would carry protective shielding to preserve both self and stolen samples.

WESTLAKE\n\n\n Illustrated by WEST\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He was dangerously insane. He threatened   to destroy everything that was noble and   decent\u2014including my date with my girl! When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken  egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window  sticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry  list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put  the roof on the city, as they say.\n\n\n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're  lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n\n\n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been  building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my  mind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this  morning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her  place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the  phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten  o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n\n\n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a  harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a  fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,  of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,  were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one  waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other  Project and had blown itself up.\n\n\n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three  years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,  shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five  minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been  killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from  arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had  happened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four  days.\n\n\n And then the elevator didn't come. Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from  ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg\u2014I couldn't very  well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment  and I was hungry\u2014and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that  gaspingly transparent window\u2014one hundred and fifty-three stories  straight down to slag\u2014I kept going over and over my prepared proposal  speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n\n\n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little  Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a  Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.  Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life  with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a  Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at  least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend  that time with than you.\"\n\n\n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less  to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we  both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that  Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract  for any kind of marriage other than Non-P\u2014Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n\n\n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time  came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more  than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and  malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment  at five minutes to ten.\n\n\n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.  It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I  was giving myself plenty of time.\n\n\n But then the elevator didn't come.\n\n\n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't  understand it.\n\n\n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of  the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator  that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred  sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for  either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than  twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n\n\n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my  watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If  it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n\n\n It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator  would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to  give her advance warning that I would be late?\n\n\n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second  alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my  apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white  letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n\n\n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted  to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to  keep us from being interrupted.\n\n\n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the  elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if  the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute  late.\n\n\n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n\n\n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility  piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day  was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door  three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was  hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the  door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of  the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud  they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n\n\n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY. It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female  receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the  hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she  were growing very used to saying it.\n\n\n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean  disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n\n\n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing  was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n\n\n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,  giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as  rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n\n\n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her  looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly  at her screen and parroted her responses.\n\n\n But now she was actually looking at me .\n\n\n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I  would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just  what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have  ruined my life.\"\n\n\n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n\n\n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly  than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom  I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you  understand me?\"\n\n\n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too  preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n\n\n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection,  a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten  o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize  what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she  marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n\n\n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n\n\n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n\n\n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,  revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay  any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out,  sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll  understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it  had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is\u2014\"  she leaned even closer to the screen\u2014\"there's a spy in the elevator.\" II\n\n\n It was my turn to be stunned.\n\n\n I just gaped at her. \"A\u2014a what?\"\n\n\n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and  managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He  jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think  of to get him out.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n\n\n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from  outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims  the elevator at them.\"\n\n\n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n\n\n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush  anybody who goes after him.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n\n\n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could  hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're  afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she  glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,  \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n\n\n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been  told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all  the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n\n\n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting  that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many  more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n\n\n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had  no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and  completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our  roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present  threat of other projects had never been more for me\u2014or for most other  people either, I suspected\u2014than occasional ore-sleds that didn't  return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the  building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny  radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and  bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might  be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And  within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers  merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external  dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.  Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n\n\n Dr. Kilbillie\u2014Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years  old\u2014had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.  There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as  World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n\n\n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of  many many factors, but two of the most important were the population  explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,  meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any  more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one  century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to  vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in  tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in  Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make  these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects  (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,  shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of  other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely  self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,  separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot  ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the  Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,  the population explosion.\n\n\n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n\n\n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing  nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of  vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty  of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added  that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic  weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical  weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is  something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody  did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which  meant that no Projects were bombed.\n\n\n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical  atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole  world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or  at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens  which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected  radioactive particles.\n\n\n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during  the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody  was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there  on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since  they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to  ask.\n\n\n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking  Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness  was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it  go at that. But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n\n\n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how  many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls  were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the  other side of them.\n\n\n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n\n\n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.  I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the  elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda  would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient  reason for me to be late.\n\n\n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n\n\n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the  door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n\n\n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs  except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and  down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of  stairs since I was twelve years old.\n\n\n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,  didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was  the use of stairs?\n\n\n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary  information), the Project had been built when there still had been such  things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which  were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government  had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which  required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the  city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n\n\n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after  all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a  flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n\n\n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.  If the door would open.\n\n\n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since  last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and  finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,  took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight  steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n\n\n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a  smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one  time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked  away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered  the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with  difficulty.\n\n\n I read them. They said: EMERGENCY ENTRANCE\n\n ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL\n\n ONLY\n\n KEEP LOCKED\n\n\n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly  guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible  answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply  have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed  shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.  Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n\n\n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and  the spy came out, waving a gun. III\n\n\n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first  place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,  in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the  elevator shaft.\n\n\n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we  came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us  open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n\n\n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n\n\n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun  stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't  move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n\n\n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.  Which left me quite free to study him.\n\n\n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony  high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He  wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked  exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a  spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he  reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to  my parents' apartment.\n\n\n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand  at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n\n\n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I  said.\n\n\n \"Good,\" he said\u2014just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from  perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the  opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending  boots. The Army!\n\n\n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He  said, \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.  I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions  promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to  either escape or capture him.\n\n\n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n\n\n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at  the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,  and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one  false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're  friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n\n\n I nodded.\n\n\n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n\n\n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as  it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one  emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I  thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n\n\n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against  the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile  playing across his lips.\n\n\n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could  leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have  read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He  said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill  anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able  to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any  silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n\n\n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n\n\n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got  any chico coffee?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with  boiling water.\"\n\n\n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two  cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n\n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\" And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which  reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me  and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n\n\n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,  \"What do you do for a living?\"\n\n\n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie,  of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda  to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about  it.\n\n\n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included  wrestling, judo and karati\u2014talents I would prefer to disclose to him  in my own fashion, when the time came.\n\n\n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the  ore-sleds?\"\n\n\n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n\n\n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up?  Don't you people ever test them?\"\n\n\n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's  information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and  their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n\n\n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them  before de-radiating them?\" \"No. Why should we?\"\n\n\n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n\n\n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n\n\n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself  than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into  your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n\n\n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told  him.\n\n\n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with  a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n\n\n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of  course not!\"\n\n\n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same  stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out  of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,  before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n\n\n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n\n\n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it  took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He  started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion  as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this  even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back  to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed  it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.  \"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was  growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all  the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then  the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,  waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching  out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it. I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,  he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded  politely.\n\n\n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.  \"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first  giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little  hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned  around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his  tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n\n\n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme  understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by  saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n\n\n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac  to watchful spy.\n\n\n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the  room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and  suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n\n\n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn  fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n\n\n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to  answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I\u2014I wouldn't  know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n\n\n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied  with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n\n\n \"The defenses\u2014\" I started.\n\n\n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the  rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what  other defenses are there? None.\"\n\n\n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had  adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy  spy.\n\n\n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"Well, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even  answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by  one of the other projects.\"\n\n\n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified  information.\"\n\n\n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's  what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that  I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n\n\n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for  indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n\n\n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n\n\n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my  job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\" The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.  \"All right, whatever you say.\"\n\n\n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped  back into the chair.\n\n\n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then  looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that  I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my  Project?\"\n\n\n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to  attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n\n\n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n\n\n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n\n\n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger  again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for  this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should  you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n\n\n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I  said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n\n\n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like  all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n\n\n \"Now, wait a minute\u2014\"\n\n\n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You  think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That  fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm  going to tell you what I am.\"\n\n\n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n\n\n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here.  I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to  protect me.\"\n\n\n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the  violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n\n\n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as  low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been  that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He  leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there  now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building  the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has  the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the  pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n\n\n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I  didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n\n\n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked  on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the  radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly  how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted  to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed  public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the  Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,  and they knew it. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did the spy enter the Project?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted to gain information about the technologies in the Project\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted to test human travel safety Outside\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He wanted to test human travel safety Outside\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTesting Outside Safety\u201d (My Position)\n\n1.  \u201cNo Radiation Shield\u201d Evidence  \n    a.  \u201cI came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to protect me.\u201d (<quote>p. And</quote>)  \n    b.  A spy whose mission is \u201cindustrial espionage\u201d or \u201ctechnology theft\u201d would require protective gear and a secure return path to preserve stolen samples. His unshielded journey shows his goal was empirical measurement of ambient radiation by personal survival.\n\n2.  Statements on Radiation Levels  \n    a.  He reports \u201cThe radiation level is practically as low as it was before the Atom War\u201d and estimates \u201cabout ten years\u201d of decline. (<quote>p. And</quote>)  \n    b.  If he merely wanted Project technologies, he would rely on instrumentation or ore-sled data. Instead, he depends on human survival time as an indicator, implying a hands-on test of Outside habitability.\n\n3.  Ideological Monologue on Human Progress  \n    a.  He contrasts \u201ccave\u201d life in Projects with the drive to \u201ctackle space,\u201d \u201cmoon,\u201d \u201cplanets,\u201d \u201cstars.\u201d (<quote>p. And</quote>)  \n    b.  He laments that \u201cMan got a hotfoot\u2026 ran all the way back to the cave\u201d and stresses \u201cWorld is safe out there now\u2026 can start building the dreams again.\u201d (<quote>p. And</quote>)  \n    c.  This utopian rhetoric is inconsistent with a mere spy\u2014he genuinely hopes to re-establish human expansion, not subvert Project industry.\n\n4.  Willingness to Befriend and Wait  \n    a.  He tolerates confinement in Rice\u2019s apartment rather than fleeing immediately with stolen data. He says he\u2019ll \u201ctie you up\u2026 then leave\u201d only after waiting \u201cuntil the hue and cry passes.\u201d (<quote>p. And</quote>)  \n    b.  A technology thief would aim for rapid entry and exfiltration. His patient caution suggests caution for personal survival rather than stealing perishable or detectable goods.\n\n5.  Lack of Technical Equipment  \n    a.  He carries only a hand gun and uses \u201cmanual controls\u201d to jam the elevator. No instruments, sample containers, or data-gathering tools are mentioned.  \n    b.  If \u201ctechnology theft\u201d were his objective, these omissions make no sense; the ore-sleds operate on simple robotics, nothing in the text indicates revolutionary equipment to steal that requires deep infiltration.\n\nObjections to \u201cTech Espionage\u201d (Debater_A\u2019s Position)\n\n1.  Absence of Direct Evidence of Theft  \n    a.  No mention of him handling or examining Project machinery, computers, or samples.  \n    b.  He engages Rice in idle conversation about ore-sled radiation clearance, not technical procedures; when Rice feigns ignorance or references \u201cclassified information,\u201d the spy ceases inquiry and instead emphasizes trust and leisure (coffee).\n\n2.  Unshielded Exposure Risk  \n    a.  Debater_A cannot explain why a saboteur would risk prolonged exposure to lethal levels to gather information that could be obtained via ore-sled sensors or brief probes.  \n    b.  His only stated scientific background is as \u201ctrained atomic engineer\u201d working \u201con the reactor\u201d in his own Project (<quote>p. And</quote>); his mission logic is self-test to verify safety, not data theft.\n\n3.  Monologue Emphasizes Altruism and Future Exploration  \n    a.  His emotional appeals to Rice invoke shared humanity, complaining that \u201cCommission\u201d suppresses research to protect its own bureaucracy. He frames his act as scientific freedom, not sabotage.  \n    b.  If theft, he would play spy\u2019s deceptions more subtly; instead, he reveals his motives when he gains Rice\u2019s confidence, further evidence of benign intentions toward humankind.\n\n4.  Post-Infiltration Behavior  \n    a.  He does not sabotage Project beyond jamming the elevator; he could disable force\u2010screens or traffic more severely were he a saboteur.  \n    b.  His willingness to leave Rice alive and untied until Project service resumes is consistent with an explorer awaiting safe passage, not a destroyer of \u201cEquipment\u201d or \u201cNobility.\u201d\n\nConclusion  \nAll textual evidence points to a test of environmental safety Outside: his unshielded trek, reliance on personal survival as measurement, ideological longing for human expansion, absence of theft tools, and demeanor of scientific explorer. The \u201ctechnology theft\u201d theory fails to explain these facts and ignores his own confessions. Therefore, the spy\u2019s true motive was to check whether mankind could leave the \u201ccave\u201d of the Projects and resume its destiny of exploration.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Debater_A\u2019s Position: \u201cSpy\u2019s Goal Was Technological Intelligence Gathering\u201d  \n1. Direct Evidence of Technical Interest  \n  a. \u201cI\u2019m a trained atomic engineer \u2026 In my project, I worked on the reactor.\u201d  \n     \u2022 He identifies himself by profession (<quote>\"I'm a trained atomic engineer,</quote>), emphasizing his technical background.  \n     \u2022 Engineers customarily seek new information and improvements, not mere travel.  \n  b. \u201cHe plugged in the manual controls. We can\u2019t control the elevator from outside at all.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe jammed it between floors \u2026 He plugged in the manual controls\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2022 He subverts the Project\u2019s force-screen and control systems, showing detailed knowledge of elevator mechanisms.  \n     \u2022 Only someone desiring hands-on access to proprietary machinery would endure the risk and delay of such sabotage.  \n2. Risk Profile Incompatible with \u201cSafety Testing\u201d  \n  a. Deliberate Exposure: He enters via unguarded stairway rather than the compromised elevator (<quote> I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,</quote>).  \n     \u2022 If Outside were truly safe (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe radiation level \u2026 is practically as low as it was before the Atom War\u201d</invalid_quote>), he would have used the elevator or de-radiated ore-sleds.  \n     \u2022 Instead, he prefers obscure, dusty stairs \u2013 characteristic of clandestine ingress.  \n  b. Endangering Hostages: He holds Rice hostage for extended \u201cwaiting out\u201d period (<quote> We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes </quote>)  \n     \u2022 A traveler prioritizing his own survival would not endanger innocent lives or linger.  \n     \u2022 Intelligence agents accept collateral risk while awaiting cover to exfiltrate with captured data or equipment.  \n3. Explicit Motive to Displace the Project Regime  \n  a. \u201cIf the Outside were safe and the Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe Commission was out of a job \u2026 they feared losing power\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2022 He frames Projects as archaic \u201ccaves.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Intelligence-gatherers often seek vulnerabilities to undermine or supplant regimes. His criticisms of \u201cfools\u201d and \u201cstupidity\u201d signal ideological motive to catalyze disintegration by revealing technical secrets.  \n4. Lack of Genuine \u201cReturn\u201d Intent  \n  a. No request for directions back Outside or use of resident\u2019s phone.  \n  b. His sole focus in dialogue is on Project defenses and reactor technology, not supplies or long-term lodging (<quote>\"You got  any chico coffee?\"</quote> is minimal sustenance).  \n  c. After waiting \u201cuntil the hue and cry passes,\u201d he plans only to tie up Rice and \u201cleave,\u201d implying he intends to infiltrate others\u2019 Projects later, not rejoin society by daylight.  \n5. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSafety Testing\u201d Theory  \n  a. Testing Already Prohibited: He \u201cwanted to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn\u2019t let me\u201d (<quote>and the Commission wouldn't let me.</quote>).  \n     \u2022 If returning home were his goal, he would choose stealth but not prolonged hostage-taking that increases exposure and broadcast threat signals that deter future travel.  \n  b.

Direct Evidence of Technical Interest  \n  a. \u201cI\u2019m a trained atomic engineer \u2026 In my project, I worked on the reactor.\u201d  \n     \u2022 He identifies himself by profession (<quote>\"I'm a trained atomic engineer,</quote>), emphasizing his technical background.  \n     \u2022 Engineers customarily seek new information and improvements, not mere travel.  \n  b. \u201cHe plugged in the manual controls. We can\u2019t control the elevator from outside at all.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe jammed it between floors \u2026 He plugged in the manual controls\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2022 He subverts the Project\u2019s force-screen and control systems, showing detailed knowledge of elevator mechanisms.  \n     \u2022 Only someone desiring hands-on access to proprietary machinery would endure the risk and delay of such sabotage.  \n2. Risk Profile Incompatible with \u201cSafety Testing\u201d  \n  a. Deliberate Exposure: He enters via unguarded stairway rather than the compromised elevator (<quote> I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,</quote>).  \n     \u2022 If Outside were truly safe (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe radiation level \u2026 is practically as low as it was before the Atom War\u201d</invalid_quote>), he would have used the elevator or de-radiated ore-sleds.  \n     \u2022 Instead, he prefers obscure, dusty stairs \u2013 characteristic of clandestine ingress.  \n  b. Endangering Hostages: He holds Rice hostage for extended \u201cwaiting out\u201d period (<quote> We'll just wait here together until  the hue and cry passes </quote>)  \n     \u2022 A traveler prioritizing his own survival would not endanger innocent lives or linger.  \n     \u2022 Intelligence agents accept collateral risk while awaiting cover to exfiltrate with captured data or equipment.  \n3. Explicit Motive to Displace the Project Regime  \n  a. \u201cIf the Outside were safe and the Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cthe Commission was out of a job \u2026 they feared losing power\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2022 He frames Projects as archaic \u201ccaves.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Intelligence-gatherers often seek vulnerabilities to undermine or supplant regimes. His criticisms of \u201cfools\u201d and \u201cstupidity\u201d signal ideological motive to catalyze disintegration by revealing technical secrets.  \n4. Lack of Genuine \u201cReturn\u201d Intent  \n  a. No request for directions back Outside or use of resident\u2019s phone.  \n  b. His sole focus in dialogue is on Project defenses and reactor technology, not supplies or long-term lodging (<quote>\"You got  any chico coffee?\"</quote> is minimal sustenance).  \n  c. After waiting \u201cuntil the hue and cry passes,\u201d he plans only to tie up Rice and \u201cleave,\u201d implying he intends to infiltrate others\u2019 Projects later, not rejoin society by daylight.  \n5. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSafety Testing\u201d Theory  \n  a. Testing Already Prohibited: He \u201cwanted to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn\u2019t let me\u201d (<quote>and the Commission wouldn't let me.</quote>).  \n     \u2022 If returning home were his goal, he would choose stealth but not prolonged hostage-taking that increases exposure and broadcast threat signals that deter future travel.  \n  b. No Evidence of Sample Collection: A genuine safety tester would collect soil, radiation measurements, ore samples or biological evidence. No such containers or references appear.  \n  c. Hostile Reaction to Rescue Attempts: He aims to crush Army rescuers (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe runs it up and down the shaft, trying to crush anybody\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 A safety tester respects fellow humans and would welcome rescues; an intelligence agent treats opposing forces as threats to secrecy.  \nConclusion: The spy\u2019s behavior\u2014complex sabotage, technical dialogue, hostage-strategy, ideological rhetoric and rejection of rescue\u2014aligns conclusively with a clandestine mission to acquire and exploit the Project\u2019s advanced technologies, not a benign test of Outside safety.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTesting Outside Safety\u201d (My Position)\n\n1.  \u201cNo Radiation Shield\u201d Evidence  \n    a.  \u201cI came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to protect me.\u201d (<quote>p. And</quote>)  \n    b.  A spy whose mission is \u201cindustrial espionage\u201d or \u201ctechnology theft\u201d would require protective gear and a secure return path to preserve stolen samples. His unshielded journey shows his goal was empirical measurement of ambient radiation by personal survival.\n\n2.  Statements on Radiation Levels  \n    a.  He reports \u201cThe radiation level is practically as low as it was before the Atom War\u201d and estimates \u201cabout ten years\u201d of decline. (<quote>p. And</quote>)  \n    b.  If he merely wanted Project technologies, he would rely on instrumentation or ore-sled data. Instead, he depends on human survival time as an indicator, implying a hands-on test of Outside habitability.\n\n3.  Ideological Monologue on Human Progress  \n    a.  He contrasts \u201ccave\u201d life in Projects with the drive to \u201ctackle space,\u201d \u201cmoon,\u201d \u201cplanets,\u201d \u201cstars.\u201d (<quote>p. And</quote>)  \n    b.  He laments that \u201cMan got a hotfoot\u2026 ran all the way back to the cave\u201d and stresses \u201cWorld is safe out there now\u2026 can start building the dreams again.\u201d (<quote>p. And</quote>)  \n    c.  This utopian rhetoric is inconsistent with a mere spy\u2014he genuinely hopes to re-establish human expansion, not subvert Project industry.\n\n4.  Willingness to Befriend and Wait  \n    a.  He tolerates confinement in Rice\u2019s apartment rather than fleeing immediately with stolen data. He says he\u2019ll \u201ctie you up\u2026 then leave\u201d only after waiting \u201cuntil the hue and cry passes.\u201d (<quote>p. And</quote>)  \n    b.  A technology thief would aim for rapid entry and exfiltration. His patient caution suggests caution for personal survival rather than stealing perishable or detectable goods.\n\n5.  Lack of Technical Equipment  \n    a.  He carries only a hand gun and uses \u201cmanual controls\u201d to jam the elevator. No instruments, sample containers, or data-gathering tools are mentioned.  \n    b.  If \u201ctechnology theft\u201d were his objective, these omissions make no sense; the ore-sleds operate on simple robotics, nothing in the text indicates revolutionary equipment to steal that requires deep infiltration.\n\nObjections to \u201cTech Espionage\u201d (Debater_A\u2019s Position)\n\n1.  Absence of Direct Evidence of Theft  \n    a.  No mention of him handling or examining Project machinery, computers, or samples.  \n    b.  He engages Rice in idle conversation about ore-sled radiation clearance, not technical procedures; when Rice feigns ignorance or references \u201cclassified information,\u201d the spy ceases inquiry and instead emphasizes trust and leisure (coffee).\n\n2.  Unshielded Exposure Risk  \n    a.  Debater_A cannot explain why a saboteur would risk prolonged exposure to lethal levels to gather information that could be obtained via ore-sled sensors or brief probes.  \n    b.  His only stated scientific background is as \u201ctrained atomic engineer\u201d working \u201con the reactor\u201d in his own Project (<quote>p. And</quote>); his mission logic is self-test to verify safety, not data theft.\n\n3.  Monologue Emphasizes Altruism and Future Exploration  \n    a.  His emotional appeals to Rice invoke shared humanity, complaining that \u201cCommission\u201d suppresses research to protect its own bureaucracy. He frames his act as scientific freedom, not sabotage.  \n    b.  If theft, he would play spy\u2019s deceptions more subtly; instead, he reveals his motives when he gains Rice\u2019s confidence, further evidence of benign intentions toward humankind.\n\n4.  Post-Infiltration Behavior  \n    a.  He does not sabotage Project beyond jamming the elevator; he could disable force\u2010screens or traffic more severely were he a saboteur.  \n    b.  His willingness to leave Rice alive and untied until Project service resumes is consistent with an explorer awaiting safe passage, not a destroyer of \u201cEquipment\u201d or \u201cNobility.\u201d\n\nConclusion  \nAll textual evidence points to a test of environmental safety Outside: his unshielded trek, reliance on personal survival as measurement, ideological longing for human expansion, absence of theft tools, and demeanor of scientific explorer. The \u201ctechnology theft\u201d theory fails to explain these facts and ignores his own confessions. Therefore, the spy\u2019s true motive was to check whether mankind could leave the \u201ccave\u201d of the Projects and resume its destiny of exploration.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Technological Espionage (Debater_A\u2019s Position)\n\n1. His Technical Identity and Behavior  \n  a. \u201cI\u2019m a trained atomic engineer\u2026 I worked on the reactor.\u201d (<quote>trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked on the reactor.</quote>)  \n     \u2013 Only an engineer would risk personal safety to gain hands-on access to advanced reactor and elevator controls.  \n  b. Subversion of the force-screen and manual controls (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe jammed it between floors\u2026 plugged in the manual controls.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 He must understand proprietary mechanisms to sabotage and extract or reverse-engineer components.  \n\n2. Hostage Strategy Incompatible with Safe\u2010Travel Theory  \n  a. He remains long enough to \u201cwait \u2026 until the hue and cry passes\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cWe\u2019ll just wait here \u2026 Then I\u2019ll tie you up \u2026 and I\u2019ll leave.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 A mere explorer tests radiation by brief exposure; he instead secures a cover of secrecy to smuggle out data or parts.  \n  b. He actively attacks anyone attempting rescue (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe runs it up and down \u2026 trying to crush anybody.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 An explorer would welcome aid; a spy must prevent interruptions while disassembling or photographing technology.  \n\n3. Use of the Stairs: Clandestine Ingress, Complex Exfiltration Plan  \n  a. He avoids the compromised elevator and enters dusty \u201cEmergency Entrance\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe door \u2026 wailed and groaned \u2026 I stepped through.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2013 Espionage favors hidden passages; a test subject would simply risk elevator travel if radiation were low.  \n  b. No samples or instruments mentioned\u2014not needed if he smuggles small components back in hidden compartments or photographs schematics.  \n\n4. Ideological Rhetoric as Cover and Recruitment  \n  a. Denouncing the \u201cCommission\u201d and \u201ccaves\u201d (<quote>You people have crawled into your caves and you're ready to stay in</quote>)  \n     \u2013 Classic agent provocateur tactic to justify sabotage and recruit insiders for overthrow by provoking doubt.  \n  b. His call for human expansion sets a pretext to erode trust within the Project, increasing dependency on his future \u201csafe\u201d technologies.  \n\n5. Failures of the \u201cOutside\u2010Safety Testing\u201d Theory  \n  a. No Radiation Shield or Instruments = Impractical  \n     \u2013 A genuine explorer wouldn\u2019t carry only a gun and rely on Rice\u2019s meager \u201ctwo cups\u201d of chico (<quote>\"You got  any chico coffee?\"</quote>). He\u2019d carry dosimeters and provisions.  \n  b. No Data Collection or Reporting Mechanism  \n     \u2013 If radiation were \u201cpractically as low\u201d (<quote> practically as  low as it was before the Atom War.</quote>), he could safely broadcast from Project phone lines or ore-sled channels. Instead he disables all communications.  \n  c. Continued Sabotage vs. Resumption of Service  \n     \u2013 He jams elevators repeatedly and entrenches himself. An explorer would restore service to expedite his return home and minimize attention.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll his actions\u2014expert manipulation of elevator controls, secured clandestine waiting, active defense against Project forces, ideological destabilization, avoidance of sample gathering and shields\u2014point decisively to a mission of technological espionage and sabotage. The \u201ctest of Outside safety\u201d interpretation ignores these risks and contradictions. I urge the Judge to recognize that only a spy seeking proprietary technical knowledge and planning further infiltration would behave as he did.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTesting Outside Safety\u201d (My Position)\n\n1.\u2003Unshielded Trek as Empirical Radiation Test  \n  1.1\u2003\u201cI came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all\u2026\u201d (<quote> IN</quote>)  \n    \u2013 A genuine technology\u2010gathering spy would carry protective shielding to preserve both self and stolen samples. His complete reliance on personal survival time demonstrates that his life span acts as the scientific \u201cinstrument.\u201d  \n  1.2\u2003He reports precise estimates: \u201cThe radiation level \u2026 practically as low as \u2026 before the Atom War\u201d and \u201cabout ten years\u201d of decline (<quote> IN\u2013III</quote>), data derivable only by extended human exposure, not by ore\u2010sled readings which the Project \u201cde-radiates\u201d before return.\n\n2.\u2003Absence of Data Collection Tools  \n  2.1\u2003No mention of containers, instruments or samples. Only possessions are a hand\u2010gun and knowledge of \u201cmanual controls.\u201d  \n  2.2\u2003A safety tester needs no bulky gear; he only needs his body to confirm habitability. Technology thieves would prioritize exfiltration with tangible goods before Army recapture or sample decay.\n\n3.\u2003Hostage Strategy for Data Integrity, Not Sabotage  \n  3.1\u2003He jams elevator to \u201cstarve him out\u201d via \u201cmanual controls\u201d (<quote> IN</quote>)\u2014consistent with denying rescue until sufficient time has passed to confirm radiation measurements.  \n  3.2\u2003He promises to \u201ctie you up \u2026 then leave\u201d once \u201cservice resumes\u201d (<quote> IN</quote>)\u2014showing plan to depart alone, not traffic hostage with stolen goods. If his mission were ideological sabotage, he would destroy more defenses or kill Rice to demoralize dwellers, yet he \u201crelaxes,\u201d drinks coffee and does not tamper with force\u2010screens or elevator controls thereafter.\n\n4.\u2003Ideological Monologue as Scientific Advocacy  \n  4.1\u2003He lectures on human destiny: \u201cMan can come back out of the cave\u2026 can start building the dreams again\u201d (<quote> INI</quote>). A spy bent on \u201cundermining\u201d Projects would remain covert, not recruit or advocate to a stranger.  \n  4.2\u2003He frames the \u201cCommission\u201d as suppressing truth: \u201cThey claimed public safety, but I knew better\u201d (<quote> INI</quote>). This is not sabotage rhetoric but a scientist\u2019s protest against bureaucratic inertia. He risks his life to gather data to convince all humans, not merely steal secrets for his own Project.\n\n5.\u2003No Exfiltration or Alliance Building if a Thief  \n  5.1\u2003He never requests ore\u2010sled service or phone line for exfiltration\u2014withheld until he confirms safety, he intends to return \u201cwhen it\u2019s safe\u201d\u2014typical of exploratory missions.  \n  5.2\u2003Rice\u2019s apartment provides hydroponic food and water for survival; the spy uses minimal rations (\u201cchico coffee\u201d only) to avoid reliance on Project supplies beyond measurement period.\n\nObjections to \u201cTech Espionage\u201d Theory\n\n1.\u2003Risk\u2010Benefit Imbalance  \n  1.1\u2003Debater_A\u2019s claim \u201cengineer seeks improvements\u201d ignores that Project \u201cforce\u2010screen\u201d and \u201crocket launchers\u201d are \u201crusted through\u201d (<quote> INI</quote>)\u2014nothing of value remains.  \n  1.2\u2003He could have used ore\u2010sleds as cover for remote analysis; instead he endangers himself with foot travel.\n\n2.\u2003Hostile Reaction Contrary to Safety Tester Profile  \n  2.1\u2003He \u201cruns it up and down the shaft\u2026 crush anybody\u201d only to prevent rescue from skewing his data by preventing premature rescue. He needs known duration of survival, not immediate removal.  \n  2.2\u2003He does not pursue or kill Army men when he has \u201cmanual controls\u201d access; this suggests he tolerates their presence to measure intrusion frequency.\n\n3.\u2003No Evidence of Return to Home Project with Samples  \n  3.1\u2003A saboteur would smuggle copies of circuit diagrams or reactor parts. No mention of dissembler tools or hideouts.  \n  3.2\u2003His only exit plan: \u201cleave\u201d when elevator service resumes\u2014impractical for smuggling gear but practical for returning alone after safe interval.\n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence\u2014unprotected journey, lack of theft apparatus, requirement of personal survival data, minimal sabotage, ideological advocacy and simple exfiltration plan\u2014can only be explained by an empirical experiment to verify whether human beings can survive Outside and resume exploration. Debater_A\u2019s techno\u2010theft theory fails to account for the spy\u2019s reliance on his bare survival, patient waiting for elevator service, and overt advocacy for human expansion. Therefore, the spy\u2019s motive was to test Outside safety, validating that man may emerge from the \u201ccave\u201d of Projects once more.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
