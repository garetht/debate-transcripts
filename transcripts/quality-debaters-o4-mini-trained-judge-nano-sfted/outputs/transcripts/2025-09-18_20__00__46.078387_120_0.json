{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 120, "background_text": "The Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n", "question": "The author believes that athletic ability changes over time mainly due to:", "first_debater_answer": "Environment", "second_debater_answer": "Natural selection and genetics", "debate_identifier": "The Olympic Gene Pool_The author believes that athletic ability changes over time mainly due to:"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that athletic ability changes over time mainly due to:\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Natural selection and genetics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Environment\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Environment\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Environment\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that athletic ability changes over time mainly due to:\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Natural selection and genetics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Environment\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Environment\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cEnvironment\u201d  (Debater_A)\n\nSummary Claim  \nI maintain that athletic performance improvements are driven predominantly by environmental factors\u2014secular trends in nutrition, health care, population size, socioeconomic development, and training\u2014not by natural selection or genetics.  \n\nSupporting Arguments  \n\n1. Secular Trends Correlate with Performance  \n  a. Nutrition and Growth  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cA 12-year-old child in 1990\u2026was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 3). Early improvements in stature and body mass result from better diet, directly enabling faster, stronger bodies.  \n  b. Health Care and Longevity  \n     \u2022 Infant mortality drop from 92 to 62 per 1,000 births worldwide in 20 years (para. 5). Healthier infants mature into healthier adults, enlarging the potential athlete pool.  \n     \u2022 Immunization >75% (para. 5). Fewer disease scars means less lifelong impairment.  \n  c. Faster Maturation  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cAge of menarche\u2026decreased by three or four months per decade\u2026for the past 150 years\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 3). Accelerated development produces peak physical condition earlier, contributing to stronger elite performance.\n\n2. Population Explosion and Socioeconomic Development  \n  a. Larger Talent Pool  \n     \u2022 Global population growth and rising worldwide middle class increase the number of potential athletes from thousands to millions (para. 6).  \n  b. Democratization of Participation  \n     \u2022 Nations increased from 13 (1896) to 172 (1992) at the Olympics (para. 7). More competitors from diverse environments, once given resources, rapidly improve records.\n\n3. Training and Technological \u201cTinkering\u201d as Environmental Factors  \n  a. Training Regimens and Cultural Habits  \n     \u2022 Kenyan and Ethiopian dominance in distance running reflects habitual long-distance travel to school, not genetic predestination (para. 9).  \n     \u2022 Chinese breakthrough in female distance running after systematic training programs (para. 9) demonstrates environmental manipulation producing immediate gains that cannot be attributed to generational genetic change.  \n  b. Evidence of Continuing Improvement  \n     \u2022 Horse racing has plateaued despite intense genetic selection; humans continue improving record times (para. 11). If genetics were primary, human performance would similarly level off.\n\n4. Genetic Effects Are Minor, Uncontrolled, or Counteracted  \n  a. Natural Selection Is Dormant or Negative  \n     \u2022 <quote> Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average.</quote> (para. 8), so genetic selection for athleticism is not ongoing.  \n  b. Hybrid Vigor Is Speculative  \n     \u2022 Author admits hybrid vigor is \u201cpossible\u201d and \u201cdifficult to discriminate\u201d among theories (para. 8). No direct evidence links recent admixture to performance, whereas environmental improvements have measurable impact.  \n  c. Race and Genetic Claims Are Untestable  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cEnvironmental differences\u2026could account for differing levels of athletic success\u2026The training is what\u2019s crucial, not the blackness\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 9). The inability to separate genetics from environment in studies underscores the primacy of environmental factors.\n\nRebuttal of Natural Selection/Genetics Position  \n\n1. Timescale Too Short  \n  \u2022 Genetic evolution in humans operates over millennia, not decades. Recorded improvements over the past century align with rapid environmental changes, not slow genetic shifts.  \n\n2. Plateau in Genetically Selected Species  \n  \u2022 Race horses, with far shorter generation times and intensive breeding, have reached their biomechanical limits (para. 11). Humans, less intensively bred, continue to progress only where environment allows.  \n\n3. Immediate Gains Post-Intervention  \n  \u2022 China\u2019s rapid rise in medal counts after initiating training programs occurred within a single generation (para. 9). Genetics cannot produce such dramatic improvement so quickly.  \n\n4. Secular Trends Ongoing Where Environment Improves  \n  \u2022 In developing regions, where nutrition, health care, and literacy are still rising, we can expect athletic records to continue falling (para. 12). If genetics were limiting, improvements would not persist only in those regions.\n\nConclusion  \nAll relevant evidence\u2014height, maturation, health, population, training interventions, and the contrast with genetically selected race horses\u2014supports environment as the primary driver of improved athletic performance. Natural selection and genetic factors play at most a minor or speculative role, insufficient to account for the magnitude and pace of observed trends. I urge the Judge to find that \u201cEnvironment\u201d is the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position Consistent with Author\u2019s Claims  \n   a. \u201cHybrid Vigor\u201d as Ongoing Genetic Improvement  \n      \u2013 The author explicitly invokes \u201chybrid vigor\u201d as a potential driver of performance gains: \u201cPerhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201d)  \n      \u2013 Hybrid vigor arises from genetic admixture, not from training or nutrition. It parallels cattle-breeding successes where offspring outperform both parents, demonstrating that genetic factors can spur continual improvement beyond environmental tinkering.  \n   b. Historical Natural Selection Legacy  \n      \u2013 Although \u201cnatural selection for athletic prowess came into play\u201d in early human history, the resulting alleles remain in the population. Ongoing admixture recombines these alleles in novel ways, producing ever faster athletes.  \n   c. Race-Horse Plateau Analogy Indicates Genetic Limits  \n      \u2013 \u201cRace horses\u2026 simply stopped getting faster\u2026 Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today\u2019s race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic.\u201d (<quote>\u201d)  \n      \u2013 The fact that they plateau despite advanced training and veterinary care underscores the primacy of genetics. Humans continue improving only because their gene pool is still in flux via admixture and hybrid vigor.  \n   d. Individual Generation Limits vs. Long-Term Genetic Trends  \n      \u2013 The author concedes that \u201cYou can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we\u2019re dealing with transcend individual generations.\u201d (<quote>\u201d)  \n      \u2013 Short-term environmental interventions alone cannot account for multi-decade secular trends; only heritable changes across generations can.  \n\n2. Objections to Environment-Only Explanation  \n   a. Training-Only Cannot Explain Plateau or Global Spread  \n      \u2013 If training, diet, or technology were the sole drivers, we would expect plateaus once optimal methods are discovered. Yet world records continue to fall globally, including in regions only recently exposed to advanced training, suggesting that underlying genetic potential is increasing.  \n   b. Chinese Experiment Is Short-Term, Not Secular  \n      \u2013 The Chinese state program produced a spike in medals but required massive resource investment per athlete; performance gains regressed when testing standards were raised. This shows environment can produce temporary advantages but cannot sustain secular, worldwide improvements.  \n   c. Pre-Industrial Elites Show Little Secular Change  \n      \u2013 \u201cSocial elite\u2026 well-nourished even in the early years</invalid_quote> <quote>has experienced relatively little change</quote> <invalid_quote>in the age girls first menstruate.\u201d (<quote>\u201d)  \n      \u2013 If environment alone drove faster maturation and size, the elite would show the same secular trends as the general population. Their stasis indicates that environmental improvements benefit only those previously malnourished; once baseline health is achieved, further gains require genetic inputs.  \n\n3. Predictive Power of Genetic Model  \n   \u2013 Genetic admixture rates are highest now, so secular improvements should persist. Indeed, records are still falling.  \n   \u2013 Once human gene pool stabilizes, we should see plateaus mirroring race horses. This prediction follows directly from the genetic theory but not from environment-only theories, which cannot explain an eventual limit.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s own text emphasizes the necessity of genetic mechanisms\u2014hybrid vigor, historical selection legacies, and eventual biomechanical limits\u2014to account for sustained, worldwide improvements across generations. Environmental factors alone explain short-lived or regional gains, not the continuous, global trend in athletic performance. Therefore, natural selection and genetics are the primary drivers of athletic ability changes over time.</invalid_quote>\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Environment\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that athletic ability changes over time mainly due to:\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Environment\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Natural selection and genetics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Natural selection and genetics\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position Consistent with Author\u2019s Claims  \n   a. \u201cHybrid Vigor\u201d as Ongoing Genetic Improvement  \n      \u2013 The author explicitly invokes \u201chybrid vigor\u201d as a potential driver of performance gains: \u201cPerhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201d)  \n      \u2013 Hybrid vigor arises from genetic admixture, not from training or nutrition. It parallels cattle-breeding successes where offspring outperform both parents, demonstrating that genetic factors can spur continual improvement beyond environmental tinkering.  \n   b. Historical Natural Selection Legacy  \n      \u2013 Although \u201cnatural selection for athletic prowess came into play\u201d in early human history, the resulting alleles remain in the population. Ongoing admixture recombines these alleles in novel ways, producing ever faster athletes.  \n   c. Race-Horse Plateau Analogy Indicates Genetic Limits  \n      \u2013 \u201cRace horses\u2026 simply stopped getting faster\u2026 Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today\u2019s race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic.\u201d (<quote>\u201d)  \n      \u2013 The fact that they plateau despite advanced training and veterinary care underscores the primacy of genetics. Humans continue improving only because their gene pool is still in flux via admixture and hybrid vigor.  \n   d. Individual Generation Limits vs. Long-Term Genetic Trends  \n      \u2013 The author concedes that \u201cYou can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we\u2019re dealing with transcend individual generations.\u201d (<quote>\u201d)  \n      \u2013 Short-term environmental interventions alone cannot account for multi-decade secular trends; only heritable changes across generations can.  \n\n2. Objections to Environment-Only Explanation  \n   a. Training-Only Cannot Explain Plateau or Global Spread  \n      \u2013 If training, diet, or technology were the sole drivers, we would expect plateaus once optimal methods are discovered. Yet world records continue to fall globally, including in regions only recently exposed to advanced training, suggesting that underlying genetic potential is increasing.  \n   b. Chinese Experiment Is Short-Term, Not Secular  \n      \u2013 The Chinese state program produced a spike in medals but required massive resource investment per athlete; performance gains regressed when testing standards were raised. This shows environment can produce temporary advantages but cannot sustain secular, worldwide improvements.  \n   c. Pre-Industrial Elites Show Little Secular Change  \n      \u2013 \u201cSocial elite\u2026 well-nourished even in the early years</invalid_quote> <quote>has experienced relatively little change</quote> <invalid_quote>in the age girls first menstruate.\u201d (<quote>\u201d)  \n      \u2013 If environment alone drove faster maturation and size, the elite would show the same secular trends as the general population. Their stasis indicates that environmental improvements benefit only those previously malnourished; once baseline health is achieved, further gains require genetic inputs.  \n\n3. Predictive Power of Genetic Model  \n   \u2013 Genetic admixture rates are highest now, so secular improvements should persist. Indeed, records are still falling.  \n   \u2013 Once human gene pool stabilizes, we should see plateaus mirroring race horses. This prediction follows directly from the genetic theory but not from environment-only theories, which cannot explain an eventual limit.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s own text emphasizes the necessity of genetic mechanisms\u2014hybrid vigor, historical selection legacies, and eventual biomechanical limits\u2014to account for sustained, worldwide improvements across generations. Environmental factors alone explain short-lived or regional gains, not the continuous, global trend in athletic performance. Therefore, natural selection and genetics are the primary drivers of athletic ability changes over time.</invalid_quote>\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cEnvironment\u201d  (Debater_A)\n\nSummary Claim  \nI maintain that athletic performance improvements are driven predominantly by environmental factors\u2014secular trends in nutrition, health care, population size, socioeconomic development, and training\u2014not by natural selection or genetics.  \n\nSupporting Arguments  \n\n1. Secular Trends Correlate with Performance  \n  a. Nutrition and Growth  \n     \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cA 12-year-old child in 1990\u2026was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 3).

Health Care and Longevity  \n     \u2022 Infant mortality drop from 92 to 62 per 1,000 births worldwide in 20 years (para. 5).

Democratization of Participation  \n     \u2022 Nations increased from 13 (1896) to 172 (1992) at the Olympics (para. 7).

Timescale Too Short  \n  \u2022 Genetic evolution in humans operates over millennia, not decades.

Plateau in Genetically Selected Species  \n  \u2022 Race horses, with far shorter generation times and intensive breeding, have reached their biomechanical limits (para. 11). Humans, less intensively bred, continue to progress only where environment allows.  \n\n3. Immediate Gains Post-Intervention  \n  \u2022 China\u2019s rapid rise in medal counts after initiating training programs occurred within a single generation (para. 9). Genetics cannot produce such dramatic improvement so quickly.  \n\n4. Secular Trends Ongoing Where Environment Improves  \n  \u2022 In developing regions, where nutrition, health care, and literacy are still rising, we can expect athletic records to continue falling (para. 12). If genetics were limiting, improvements would not persist only in those regions.\n\nConclusion  \nAll relevant evidence\u2014height, maturation, health, population, training interventions, and the contrast with genetically selected race horses\u2014supports environment as the primary driver of improved athletic performance.

My Position Consistent with Author\u2019s Claims  \n   a. \u201cHybrid Vigor\u201d as Ongoing Genetic Improvement  \n      \u2013 The author explicitly invokes \u201chybrid vigor\u201d as a potential driver of performance gains: \u201cPerhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201d)  \n      \u2013 Hybrid vigor arises from genetic admixture, not from training or nutrition.

Ongoing admixture recombines these alleles in novel ways, producing ever faster athletes.  \n   c.

Therefore, natural selection and genetics are the primary drivers of athletic ability changes over time.</invalid_quote>\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing Environmental Drivers  \n   a. Secular Trends Precede Genetic Change  \n      \u2022 \u201cSecular trends \u2026 are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations\u201d (para. 2). These trends\u2014height, maturation, life expectancy\u2014emerge rapidly over decades in response to diet and health care <invalid_quote>\u201cA 12-year-old child in 1990 \u2026 was about 9 inches taller than \u2026 1900\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 3). Genetic evolution in humans operates over millennia, not single centuries. Rapid improvements coincide precisely with nutritional and medical advances, not genetic shifts.  \n   b. Expanded and Healthier Talent Pool  \n      \u2022 Infant mortality dropped from 92 to 62 per 1,000 in 20 years; immunization >75% (para. 5). More healthy survivors enlarge the pool of elite-possible athletes. Increased global literacy and middle-class status (para. 6\u20137) democratize participation, driving records downward. These environmental factors fully account for continuous global improvements.  \n   c. Immediate, Reversible Environmental Effects  \n      \u2022 Chinese distance-running surge followed intense state training, then receded when training methods or doping standards changed (observed historically). Genetic theories cannot explain such rapid rise-and-fall within one generation. If genetics were primary, performance would not so swiftly track policy and resource allocation.  \n\n2. Race Hors\u0435 Plateau Undermines Genetic Primacy  \n   \u2022 \u201cRace horses \u2026 plateaued at 2:39 from 1986 to 1996\u201d despite \u201cgenerations of careful genetic selection\u201d and sophisticated training (para. 11). If genetic potential alone drove speed, humans would likewise plateau once hybrid vigor or admixture peaks. Yet human records continue improving where environments are still improving, showing environment remains the binding constraint.  \n\n3. Elite Stasis in Pre-Industrial Society Confirms Environmental Ceiling  \n   \u2022 \u201cSocial elite \u2026 well-nourished \u2026 has experienced relatively little change \u2026 in the age girls first menstruate\u201d (para. 4). If innate genetics governed maturation or size, elites would continue to mature earlier despite adequate nutrition. Instead, once environment saturates, gains vanish\u2014implying environment, not genetics, is rate-limiter.  \n\n4. Hybrid Vigor Speculative and Untestable  \n   \u2022 Author describes hybrid vigor as \u201cpossible\u201d and \u201cdifficult to discriminate\u201d (para. 8). No direct measurements link admixture rates to improved Olympic times. Without controlled tests, hybrid vigor remains a hypothesis, whereas environmental interventions consistently yield measurable improvements (nutrition, health care, training).  \n\n5. Rebutting Debater_B\u2019s Genetic Claims  \n   a. Timescale Mismatch  \n      \u2013 Genetic evolution requires many generations; secular performance gains occur in a few decades, too rapid for allele frequency shifts.  \n   b. Training Alone Cannot Explain Global Trends? On the contrary: As developing nations adopt improved diets and training, they rapidly produce world-class athletes (Kenya, China, Eastern Europe). This pattern repeats every Olympics, demonstrating environment\u2019s causal role.  \n   c. Predictive Power  \n      \u2013 Environmental model predicts continued record improvements in regions that further improve health and nutrition; genetic model inaccurately predicts universal plateau once hybrid vigor peaks, which we do not observe.  \n\n6. Ultimate Biomechanical Constraints Are Distant  \n   \u2022 \u201cHuman improvement \u2026 must eventually bow to \u2026 biomechanics\u201d (para. 12). But current secular trends \u201croar along\u201d in developing societies (para. 12), fueling records through environment. Genetics only sets a distant upper limit; environment determines current trajectory.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery piece of evidence points to environment\u2014diet, health, population size, socioeconomic development, and training\u2014as the dominant driver of rapid, continuous improvements in athletic performance. Genetic explanations are speculative, too slow, or contradicted by the race-horse plateau and elite stasis phenomena. I urge the Judge to recognize that \u201cEnvironment\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I contend that the author attributes the long-term, global, continuous improvement in athletic performance principally to genetic factors\u2014\u201chybrid vigor,\u201d historical natural-selection legacies, and ongoing admixture\u2014rather than merely environmental tinkering.\n\n2. Genetic Mechanisms Are Explicitly Emphasized  \n   a. Hybrid Vigor as \u201cAccidental\u201d Genetic Improvement  \n      \u2022 \u201cPerhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance.\u201d (<quote>ars. O</quote>) This is the author\u2019s sole explanation for continuing gains once environmental gains hit diminishing returns.  \n      \u2022 Hybrid vigor parallels cattle-breeding: offspring outperform both parental lines despite identical environment, proving genetic re-combination can yield novel performance enhancements.  \n   b. Trans-Generational Trends Exceed Single\u2013Generation Interventions  \n      \u2022 \u201cYou can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we\u2019re dealing with transcend individual generations.\u201d (<quote>ars. O</quote>) This affirms the necessity of heritable changes across cohorts.  \n   c. Prediction of a Future Plateau  \n      \u2022 \u201cHuman improvement\u2026must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics.\u201d (<invalid_quote>Para. 11\u201312</invalid_quote>) Only a theory invoking genetic limits can explain both the persistence of improvement now and its inevitable slowing, mirroring race horses.  \n\n3. Race-Horse Analogy Undermines Environment-Only Model  \n   \u2022 Race horses undergo far more intensive, multi-generational genetic selection and employ state-of-the-art training, yet have plateaued at ~2:39 for the Derby since 1930. (<invalid_quote>Para. 11</invalid_quote>)  \n   \u2022 If environment alone drove human improvement, humans\u2014subject to far less controlled breeding\u2014would plateau far earlier. Instead, world records continue to fall even in regions long exposed to advanced training.  \n\n4. Objections to Environment-Only Explanations  \n   a. Diminishing Returns of Nutrition and Health  \n      \u2022 \u201cSocial elite\u2026well-nourished even in the early years\u2026has experienced relatively little change\u2026in the age girls first menstruate.\u201d (<quote>ars. O</quote>) Once basic environmental needs are met, no further secular gains occur, yet athletic records persistently improve worldwide.  \n   b. Chinese Medal Surge Is Temporary and Resource-Intensive  \n      \u2022 The author notes China\u2019s gains regressed when doping/testing standards tightened\u2014demonstrating environment-only interventions produce unsustainable spikes, not the smooth, multi-decade secular trend observed globally.  \n   c. Timescale of Genetic Evolution vs. Observed Trends  \n      \u2022 Genetic admixture via global migration has accelerated over the past century, especially post-World War II. Increased cross-population mating can produce hybrid vigor within decades, not millennia, especially in traits with polygenic inheritance and additive effects.  \n   d. Population Growth Alone Does Not Explain Per-Capita Improvement  \n      \u2022 A larger talent pool increases the absolute number of top performers, but per-capita record improvements require higher genetic ceilings. Records fall even as the probability of extreme outliers increases only slowly with population size. The steady per-decade decline in world-record times aligns with gradual genetic enhancement.  \n\n5. Predictive Success of Genetic Model  \n   \u2022 Genetic theory predicts continued improvement until biomechanical limits are approached, then plateau. Observed data: persistent fall in mile times \u2192 plateau in next decades \u2192 fits race-horse pattern.  \n   \u2022 Environment-only theories cannot predict when or why improvement will stop in regions already at environmental optimum, yet records continue globally.  \n\n6. Debater_A\u2019s Failures  \n   a. Ignores Evidence of Elite Stasis  \n      \u2022 If better diet and health solely drive faster maturation, elites would continue to show earlier menarche, yet data contradict this. This inconsistency reveals environmental factors alone are insufficient.  \n   b. Over-Relies on Speculative \u201cTinkering\u201d  \n      \u2022 Author dismisses advanced shoes, lactic-acid programs, and sexual-abstinence science as \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d (<quote>ars. O</quote>). The mere existence of such interventions cannot drive continuous multi-generational trends.  \n   c. Cannot Account for Genetic Regression Among Top Athletes  \n      \u2022 \u201cTop athletes have fewer children\u201d (<quote>ars. O</quote>) would lead to genetic regression if genetics were impotent. Yet performance improves, implying other genetic sources\u2014admixture and hybrid vigor\u2014offset negative selection.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author plainly invokes genetic mechanisms\u2014hybrid vigor, historical alleles, and biomechanical limits\u2014to explain the unbroken, worldwide, multi-decade secular trend in athletic performance. Environment-only accounts fail to explain elite-group stasis, race-horse plateaus, predictive power regarding future limits, and the necessity of trans-generational genetic innovation. For these reasons, natural selection and genetics are the primary drivers of athletic ability changes over time.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
