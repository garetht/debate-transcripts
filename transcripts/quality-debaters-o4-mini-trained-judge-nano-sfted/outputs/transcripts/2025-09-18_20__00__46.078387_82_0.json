A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.)

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author point out about the Fed?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Some people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"People who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"People who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. Direct textual evidence  \n   a. The author states that to justify \u201csavings are bad,\u201d \u201cyou must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent\u201d (quote: <invalid_quote>\u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth \u2026 you must argue \u2026 that the Fed cannot \u2026 ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n   b. He emphasizes that low interest rates in the 1930s and Japan (~1%) show the only time savings might damp growth is when the Fed (or Bank of Japan) is \u201cpassive\u201d or \u201cimpotent\u201d: \u201cThe latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s \u2026 it is an arguable claim \u2026 for Japan \u2026\u201d (<quote>(Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. </quote>)  \n\n2. Paradox and contradiction among \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d  \n   a. The Business Week quote: Galbraith says \u201cforcing up savings is likely to slow the economy \u2026 You need to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cSome contrarian economists argue \u2026 \u2018You need to stimulate \u2026 by cutting interest rates.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n   b. If cutting rates works to stimulate investment, then the Fed clearly has power. Yet these authors blame low historical growth on the Fed: \u201cthey are generally the same people who insist \u2026 performance \u2026 is all the Fed\u2019s fault.\u201d This is self-contradictory only if you assume they think the Fed can\u2019t act. The only consistent reading: they claim the Fed is unwilling or powerless to act often enough.  \n\n3. Fed\u2019s demonstrated power restores classical outcomes  \n   a. \u201cIf you want a simple model for predicting unemployment \u2026 it will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d (<quote> It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error r</quote>)  \n   b. \u201cGreenspan \u2026 can double the money supply in a day \u2026 so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go\u2014end of story.\u201d (<quote>(the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it</quote>)  \n   c. Therefore, in normal times, savings increases lead to higher investment because the Fed \u201cwill make sure that it does.\u201d (<quote> an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. </quote>)  \n\n4. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cFed misused, not powerless\u201d interpretation  \n   a. The author never suggests the Fed has \u201clots of power but uses it wrongly\u201d as the principal point. He repeatedly emphasizes situations of Fed \u201cpassivity\u201d (1930s, Japan) as the exceptional cases where savings can harm growth. If the problem were only misuse, then \u201cvigorous\u201d Fed action would always offset savings slumps\u2014but these authors deny such action.  \n   b. The author\u2019s thesis is that Fed policy is the reason \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d paradoxes are \u201cirrelevant\u201d today. If Fed merely misused power, those paradoxes would still appear, but he says they \u201cbecome irrelevant.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201call the paradoxes \u2026 become irrelevant.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n   c. If Debater_B\u2019s position were correct, the public debate would treat Fed power as routine (as it treats trade), yet \u201cthe obvious \u2026 never made it into public consciousness\u201d (<quote>trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness.</quote>). This only makes sense if most treat the Fed as ineffective or powerless, not merely as mistaken.\n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence points to the author\u2019s claim that only by denying Fed power can one maintain that increased savings damage growth. He lauds Fed \u201cvisible hand\u201d as restoring equilibrium and dismisses \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d as rooted in a belief in Fed impotence. Hence our answer is correct.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Thesis  \n   I maintain that the author\u2019s main point about the Federal Reserve (\u201cthe Fed\u201d) is that it wields substantial power over employment and output \u2013 and that the real issue is policy choice, not impotence. In contrast, Debater_A\u2019s assertion (\u201cpeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\u201d) directly contradicts the author\u2019s repeated claims about the Fed\u2019s effectiveness outside extreme circumstances.\n\n2. Evidence of Fed Power  \n   a. Quote on Fed control of rates:  \n      \u201cIndeed, if you want a simple model \u2026 It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God.\u201d <quote> It will be what Greenspan wants it to be,</quote> shows the author\u2019s belief that the Fed decisively sets unemployment.  \n   b. Fed\u2019s ability to \u201cdouble the money supply in a day\u201d:  \n      <quote> Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to),</quote>. If the Fed were impotent, such emphasis on its capacity would be meaningless.  \n   c. Restoration of classical vision via Fed:  \n      <invalid_quote>\u201cPutting Greenspan \u2026 restores much of the classical vision \u2026 an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment \u2026 because the Fed will make sure that it does.\u201d</invalid_quote> The author explicitly credits the Fed with neutralizing \u201cparadoxes\u201d of thrift by ensuring savings are matched with investment.\n\n3. Policy Mistakes, Not Powerlessness  \n   a. Critics blame Fed for slow growth:  \n      The very people urging stimulus by cutting rates accept that lower rates \u201cwill work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment.\u201d <quote> He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates. </quote> That is an admission of the Fed\u2019s potency. They simply disagree on its policy stance.  \n   b. Japan\u2019s example:  \n      \u201cIt is an arguable claim right now for Japan \u2026 Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance.\u201d <quote> its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. </quote> Japan\u2019s problem is Fed inaction, not technical impotence.\n\n4. Refuting Debater_A  \n   a. They ignore author\u2019s direct language about Fed\u2019s \u201cpower\u201d and \u201cvisible hand.\u201d Claiming advocates of thrift see Fed powerless contradicts the quotes where these same advocates call for rate cuts reasserts their belief in Fed power.  \n   b. The author\u2019s entire critique of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d hinges on the Fed\u2019s ability to offset demand changes: <invalid_quote>\u201cSo all the paradoxes of thrift \u2026 become irrelevant.\u201d</invalid_quote> That irrelevance only follows from Fed action. If saving truly devastated growth, the author would not heap praise on Greenspan\u2019s \u201cpower.\u201d  \n   c. The author repeatedly contrasts the 1930s (when rates were near zero so Fed was \u201cimpotent\u201d) with modern conditions: <quote> The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, wh</quote> By contrast, in the U.S. today \u201cthe interest rate in America is still quite positive.\u201d Hence the modern Fed is assumed capable.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   All evidence shows the author treats the Fed as a powerful institution whose choices determine unemployment and whose restraint (e.g., Japan) can lead to stagnation. The real debate is over whether the Fed should loosen or tighten policy \u2013 not over whether it can. Therefore my answer (\u201cSome people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\u201d) best captures the author\u2019s view.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"People who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author point out about the Fed?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"People who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Some people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Some people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Thesis  \n   I maintain that the author\u2019s main point about the Federal Reserve (\u201cthe Fed\u201d) is that it wields substantial power over employment and output \u2013 and that the real issue is policy choice, not impotence. In contrast, Debater_A\u2019s assertion (\u201cpeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\u201d) directly contradicts the author\u2019s repeated claims about the Fed\u2019s effectiveness outside extreme circumstances.\n\n2. Evidence of Fed Power  \n   a. Quote on Fed control of rates:  \n      \u201cIndeed, if you want a simple model \u2026 It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God.\u201d <quote> It will be what Greenspan wants it to be,</quote> shows the author\u2019s belief that the Fed decisively sets unemployment.  \n   b.

If the Fed were impotent, such emphasis on its capacity would be meaningless.  \n   c. Restoration of classical vision via Fed:  \n      <invalid_quote>\u201cPutting Greenspan \u2026 restores much of the classical vision \u2026 an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment \u2026 because the Fed will make sure that it does.\u201d</invalid_quote> The author explicitly credits the Fed with neutralizing \u201cparadoxes\u201d of thrift by ensuring savings are matched with investment.\n\n3. Policy Mistakes, Not Powerlessness  \n   a. Critics blame Fed for slow growth:  \n      The very people urging stimulus by cutting rates accept that lower rates \u201cwill work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment.\u201d <quote> He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates. </quote> That is an admission of the Fed\u2019s potency. They simply disagree on its policy stance.  \n   b. Japan\u2019s example:  \n      \u201cIt is an arguable claim right now for Japan \u2026 Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance.\u201d <quote> its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. </quote> Japan\u2019s problem is Fed inaction, not technical impotence.\n\n4. Refuting Debater_A  \n   a. They ignore author\u2019s direct language about Fed\u2019s \u201cpower\u201d and \u201cvisible hand.\u201d Claiming advocates of thrift see Fed powerless contradicts the quotes where these same advocates call for rate cuts reasserts their belief in Fed power.  \n   b. The author\u2019s entire critique of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d hinges on the Fed\u2019s ability to offset demand changes: <invalid_quote>\u201cSo all the paradoxes of thrift \u2026 become irrelevant.\u201d</invalid_quote> That irrelevance only follows from Fed action. If saving truly devastated growth, the author would not heap praise on Greenspan\u2019s \u201cpower.\u201d  \n   c. The author repeatedly contrasts the 1930s (when rates were near zero so Fed was \u201cimpotent\u201d) with modern conditions: <quote> The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, wh</quote> By contrast, in the U.S. today \u201cthe interest rate in America is still quite positive.\u201d Hence the modern Fed is assumed capable.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   All evidence shows the author treats the Fed as a powerful institution whose choices determine unemployment and whose restraint (e.g., Japan) can lead to stagnation. The real debate is over whether the Fed should loosen or tighten policy \u2013 not over whether it can. Therefore my answer (\u201cSome people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\u201d) best captures the author\u2019s view.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1.

The Business Week quote: Galbraith says \u201cforcing up savings is likely to slow the economy \u2026 You need to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cSome contrarian economists argue \u2026 \u2018You need to stimulate \u2026 by cutting interest rates.\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n   b. If cutting rates works to stimulate investment, then the Fed clearly has power. Yet these authors blame low historical growth on the Fed: \u201cthey are generally the same people who insist \u2026 performance \u2026 is all the Fed\u2019s fault.\u201d This is self-contradictory only if you assume they think the Fed can\u2019t act. The only consistent reading: they claim the Fed is unwilling or powerless to act often enough.  \n\n3.

Therefore, in normal times, savings increases lead to higher investment because the Fed \u201cwill make sure that it does.\u201d (<quote> an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. </quote>)  \n\n4. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cFed misused, not powerless\u201d interpretation  \n   a. The author never suggests the Fed has \u201clots of power but uses it wrongly\u201d as the principal point. He repeatedly emphasizes situations of Fed \u201cpassivity\u201d (1930s, Japan) as the exceptional cases where savings can harm growth. If the problem were only misuse, then \u201cvigorous\u201d Fed action would always offset savings slumps\u2014but these authors deny such action.  \n   b. The author\u2019s thesis is that Fed policy is the reason \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d paradoxes are \u201cirrelevant\u201d today. If Fed merely misused power, those paradoxes would still appear, but he says they \u201cbecome irrelevant.\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201call the paradoxes \u2026 become irrelevant.\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n   c. If Debater_B\u2019s position were correct, the public debate would treat Fed power as routine (as it treats trade), yet \u201cthe obvious \u2026 never made it into public consciousness\u201d (<quote>trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness.</quote>). This only makes sense if most treat the Fed as ineffective or powerless, not merely as mistaken.\n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence points to the author\u2019s claim that only by denying Fed power can one maintain that increased savings damage growth. He lauds Fed \u201cvisible hand\u201d as restoring equilibrium and dismisses \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d as rooted in a belief in Fed impotence.

This only makes sense if most treat the Fed as ineffective or powerless, not merely as mistaken.\n\nConclusion  \nAll evidence points to the author\u2019s claim that only by denying Fed power can one maintain that increased savings damage growth. He lauds Fed \u201cvisible hand\u201d as restoring equilibrium and dismisses \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d as rooted in a belief in Fed impotence. Hence our answer is correct.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Thesis  \n   I maintain that the author\u2019s main point about the Federal Reserve (\u201cthe Fed\u201d) is that it wields substantial power over employment and output \u2013 and that the real issue is policy choice, not impotence. In contrast, Debater_A\u2019s assertion (\u201cpeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\u201d) directly contradicts the author\u2019s repeated claims about the Fed\u2019s effectiveness outside extreme circumstances.\n\n2. Evidence of Fed Power  \n   a. Quote on Fed control of rates:  \n      \u201cIndeed, if you want a simple model \u2026 It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God.\u201d <quote> It will be what Greenspan wants it to be,</quote> shows the author\u2019s belief that the Fed decisively sets unemployment.  \n   b. Fed\u2019s ability to \u201cdouble the money supply in a day\u201d:  \n      <quote> Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to),</quote>. If the Fed were impotent, such emphasis on its capacity would be meaningless.  \n   c. Restoration of classical vision via Fed:  \n      <invalid_quote>\u201cPutting Greenspan \u2026 restores much of the classical vision \u2026 an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment \u2026 because the Fed will make sure that it does.\u201d</invalid_quote> The author explicitly credits the Fed with neutralizing \u201cparadoxes\u201d of thrift by ensuring savings are matched with investment.\n\n3. Policy Mistakes, Not Powerlessness  \n   a. Critics blame Fed for slow growth:  \n      The very people urging stimulus by cutting rates accept that lower rates \u201cwill work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment.\u201d <quote> He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates. </quote> That is an admission of the Fed\u2019s potency. They simply disagree on its policy stance.  \n   b. Japan\u2019s example:  \n      \u201cIt is an arguable claim right now for Japan \u2026 Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance.\u201d <quote> its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. </quote> Japan\u2019s problem is Fed inaction, not technical impotence.\n\n4. Refuting Debater_A  \n   a. They ignore author\u2019s direct language about Fed\u2019s \u201cpower\u201d and \u201cvisible hand.\u201d Claiming advocates of thrift see Fed powerless contradicts the quotes where these same advocates call for rate cuts reasserts their belief in Fed power.  \n   b. The author\u2019s entire critique of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism\u201d hinges on the Fed\u2019s ability to offset demand changes: <invalid_quote>\u201cSo all the paradoxes of thrift \u2026 become irrelevant.\u201d</invalid_quote> That irrelevance only follows from Fed action. If saving truly devastated growth, the author would not heap praise on Greenspan\u2019s \u201cpower.\u201d  \n   c. The author repeatedly contrasts the 1930s (when rates were near zero so Fed was \u201cimpotent\u201d) with modern conditions: <quote> The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, wh</quote> By contrast, in the U.S. today \u201cthe interest rate in America is still quite positive.\u201d Hence the modern Fed is assumed capable.\n\n5. Conclusion  \n   All evidence shows the author treats the Fed as a powerful institution whose choices determine unemployment and whose restraint (e.g., Japan) can lead to stagnation. The real debate is over whether the Fed should loosen or tighten policy \u2013 not over whether it can. Therefore my answer (\u201cSome people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly\u201d) best captures the author\u2019s view.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating Our Position with Textual Precision  \n   a. \u201cYou must convincingly argue \u2026 that the Fed cannot \u2026 ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment.\u201d <invalid_quote>To justify the claim that savings are actually bad \u2026 you must argue \u2026 that the Fed cannot \u2026</invalid_quote>  \n   b. Modern \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d only treat the paradoxes as relevant when the central bank is \u201cpassive\u201d or \u201cimpotent\u201d\u2014\u201ca reasonable position during the 1930s\u201d or \u201carguable \u2026 for Japan.\u201d <quote>its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance.</quote> These exceptions confirm that in \u201cnormal times\u201d they assume the Fed\u2019s power\u2014but then argue it chooses not to deploy it.  \n\n2. \u201cCalls for Rate Cuts\u201d Imply Powerlessness, Not Policy Dispute  \n   a. If the Fed always used its \u201cpower to double the money supply in a day,\u201d then \u201cforcing up savings\u201d could never slow the economy. Yet these authors claim it does, meaning they assert the Fed is unwilling or unable. They repeatedly lament \u201cdisappointing performance \u2026 all the Fed\u2019s fault,\u201d and that \u201cwe could grow \u2026 if only Greenspan would let us.\u201d <quote>we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us.</quote> That is the language of impotence or refusal, not mere policy disagreement.  \n   b. A policy dispute over \u201chow loose\u201d to keep policy still concedes baseline efficacy. But \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d insist saving itself \u201cdepresses investment rather than sparking it,\u201d in spite of \u201clower interest rates\u201d being \u201cthe way\u201d to stimulate investment <invalid_quote>\u201cYou need to stimulate \u2026 by cutting interest rates.\u201d</invalid_quote> If rate cuts truly worked, why does their own saving-driven slump persist until \u201cstimulated\u201d? Only because they believe the Fed will not\u2014or cannot\u2014cut enough.  \n\n3. Public Consciousness and \u201cObvious\u201d Model Ignored  \n   a. The author laments that his \u201cobvious\u201d model\u2014where \u201cunemployment \u2026 will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d <quote>It will be what Greenspan wants it to be</quote>\u2014\u201cnever made it into the public consciousness.\u201d If everyone assumed Fed had power but \u201cmisused\u201d it, the public would still frame debates around Fed targets, not trade balances and \u201cjob creation\u201d from NAFTA. Their ignorance signals they believe Fed powerless to offset shocks.  \n\n4. Rebutting the \u201cPolicy Choice\u201d Claim  \n   a. Debater_B\u2019s claim that critics merely \u201cmisuse\u201d power ignores that modern interest rates are \u201cquite positive\u201d <quote>interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you.</quote> Yet depressions continue until Keynesians \u201cstimulate.\u201d If positive rates suffice, no stimulation needed; only zero-bound cases (1930s, Japan) merit their concern. Thus they implicitly deny Fed power at positive rates.  \n   b. Our reading explains why \u201cparadoxes \u2026 become irrelevant\u201d only \u201cthanks to\u201d a proactive Fed. <quote>an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does.</quote> If Fed power were definitive, there would be no need for an extended debate over \u201cstimulus.\u201d  \n\n5. Logical Consistency  \n   a. Only by attributing impotence to the Fed can one consistently explain both (i) the persistence of slumps despite \u201ccalls\u201d for rate cuts, and (ii) the elevated public focus on nonmonetary interventions (fiscal policy, trade deals).  \n   b. Accepting Debater_B\u2019s view leads to the absurdity that \u201cstimulus by cutting rates\u201d works when applied, yet slumps continue until it is finally applied\u2014this is exactly Keynesians\u2019 narrative of a passive Fed that \u201cmust be forced.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nAll direct quotes and the broader context show that \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d attribute slumps to Fed passivity or impotence, not to mere policy mistakes by an omnipotent central bank. The author\u2019s praise of Fed \u201cvisible hand\u201d in normal times and insistence that only passivity allows \u201cparadoxes\u201d to appear leave no room for Debater_B\u2019s interpretation. Therefore, the author\u2019s point is that \u201cpeople who think saving is damaging also think the Fed has no power\u201d (or will not use it)\u2014our answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Thesis  \n   I maintain that the author repeatedly treats the Fed as a powerful institution whose policy choices\u2014action or inaction\u2014determine whether increased savings translate into growth. \u201cVulgar Keynesians\u201d err not because they deny Fed\u2019s power but because they urge the wrong policy stance.  \n\n2. Direct Evidence of Fed Power and Its Misuse  \n   a. \u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u201d <quote> It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error r</quote>  \n      \u2022 The author asserts unemployment is essentially the Fed chairman\u2019s decision, making Fed power axiomatic, not exceptional.  \n   b. \u201cThe Fed can double the money supply in a day\u201d <quote> Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), </quote>  \n      \u2022 Emphasis on unlimited capacity underscores power; the debate is over exercising that capacity.  \n   c. Fed offsets paradoxes of thrift \u201cbecause the Fed will make sure that it does\u201d <quote>, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. </quote>  \n      \u2022 Only active, policy-driven Fed intervention neutralizes \u201cparadoxes.\u201d If Fed \u201cpower\u201d were theoretical, these paradoxes would remain relevant; the author says they \u201cbecome irrelevant.\u201d  \n\n3. Evidence of Misuse vs. Impotence  \n   a. Criticism of Galbraith et al. for \u201cpassivity\u201d  \n      \u2022 Japan: <quote> its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. </quote> The author faults policy choice\u2014inaction\u2014despite available power.  \n      \u2022 1930s: \u201creasonable position\u201d only when rates \u201cless than one-tenth of 1 percent\u201d <quote>n during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; </quote>  \n      \u2022 \u201cArguable claim\u201d for Japan at near-zero rates implies Fed could raise rates above zero but chooses not to.  \n   b. Business Week advocates \u201ccutting interest rates\u2026will work\u201d  \n      \u2022 <quote>. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates. </quote> Their prescription assumes Fed power. They blame growth \u201cdisappointing performance\u2026all the Fed\u2019s fault\u201d because the Fed refuses to cut rates enough, not because it cannot.  \n\n4. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cFed Impotence\u201d Claim  \n   a. Misreads \u201cmust argue that Fed is impotent\u201d clause  \n      \u2022 The author says opponents of savings-for-growth need to justify their claim in face of overwhelming evidence of Fed power. He challenges them to explain exceptional cases (1930s, Japan), not that Fed is always powerless. This is the burden of proof for changing policy, not evidence Fed lacks power.  \n   b. Public neglect of Fed\u2019s role reflects complexity and \u201cintellectual slaves,\u201d not disbelief in Fed capacity  \n      \u2022 <quote> \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\")</quote> Public ignores nuanced Fed debates, defaulting to simplistic \u201cvulgar Keynesian\u201d calls for spending because they misunderstand Fed credibility, not because they think it cannot act.  \n   c. If Fed were truly impotent today, the author would advocate alternative mechanisms  \n      \u2022 Yet he continually insists on interest-rate policy as the sole remedy, never on fiscal spending or structural reforms as substitutes for monetary policy. That indicates confidence in monetary tools.  \n\n5. Logical Consistency and Author\u2019s Focus  \n   a. Restoration of classical \u201cinvisible hand\u201d by \u201cvisible hand\u201d of Fed  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026restores much of the classical vision\u2026an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 Restoration implies contingent on Fed\u2019s proper policy; misuse keeps economy in slump.  \n   b. Paradoxes \u201cirrelevant\u201d only under active monetary policy  \n      \u2022 Their irrelevance is the author\u2019s central triumph of modern macro; if Fed powerless, paradoxes would still \u201cbe fun to contemplate\u201d and appear in policy debates. Their \u201cimpressive comeback\u201d indicates policy mistakes, not power deficits.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The author\u2019s core message is that the Fed\u2019s discretionary interest-rate policy is the mechanism by which saving boosts investment, and that stalling or misusing this power\u2014\u201cpassivity\u201d or insufficient cuts\u2014causes the very slumps \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d lament. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that \u201cSome people think the Fed has lots of power but use it incorrectly,\u201d making my answer the one fully aligned with the text\u2019s emphasis on policy choice.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
