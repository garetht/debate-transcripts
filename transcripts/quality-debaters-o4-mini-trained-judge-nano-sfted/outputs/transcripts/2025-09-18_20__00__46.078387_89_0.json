{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 89, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Gradual Disillusionment  \n  a. Red tape, paralysis, and debt  \n    - Soon Brussels is \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics.\u201d <quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic .</quote> (\u00b62).  \n    - Public strikes so frequent they \u201cblock traffic and commerce,\u201d undermining living standards. <invalid_quote>\u201cGround crews\u2026 smashing\u2026 millions of francs\u2026 then demanding more money\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b66).  \n  b. Economic stagnation vs. U.S. dynamism  \n    - Belgian telecom monopolies \u201cprice out\u201d Internet use; U.S. Web entrepreneurs \u201cleft Europe in the dust.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cphone monopolies\u2026 on blocking innovation\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b69).  \n    - Call-back services become necessary to circumvent overpricing; even this success is \u201ctax[ed] out of existence.\u201d <quote> European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence.</quote> (\u00b610).  \n  c. Deficits and political manipulation  \n    - National debts exceed 3 percent of GDP; governments use the forthcoming euro \u201cto shift the blame.\u201d <quote>that it has gone further into hock than the United States.</quote> (\u00b611).  \n  d. Bureaucratic corruption and incompetence  \n    - Belgium is \u201csecond-most corrupt,\u201d NATO secretary-general forced to quit for bribery. <invalid_quote>\u201c$50 million in bribes,\u201d \u201craided the headquarters\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b612).  \n    - Berlaymont headquarters closed for nine years at $50 million cost over an asbestos scare, despite studies showing removal is more dangerous. <invalid_quote>\u201c$50 million so far\u2026 if the EU can\u2019t manage its own building\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b614).\n\n3. Concluding Irony  \n  - The author ends with the patisserie\u2019s neon sign, a personal temptation, rather than any celebration of the EU. The shift from grand expectations to private sensual relief underscores his dismay with public institutions.\n\nRefutation of Debater_B (\u201cSteadfast opposition\u201d)\n\n1. Misreads the opening tone  \n  - Debater_B claims the author is \u201csteadfastly opposed\u201d from the start; yet the early text is descriptive and even admiring of \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d and \u201chistoric buildings.\u201d Opposition only emerges after firsthand investigation reveals dysfunction (\u00b62\u2013\u00b66).\n\n2. Tone becomes progressively harsher  \n  - A \u201csteadfastly opposed\u201d voice would not spend paragraphs on Lobster bisque and chocolat until reservation sets in. The repeated use of \u201cbut\u201d (e.g., \u201cBut the real overriding goal\u2026\u201d) shows a turning point.\n\n3. The author\u2019s final retreat to the patisserie (\u00b614) is a personal solace, not a political position, demonstrating exhaustion rather than ideological consistency.\n\nConclusion  \n  The author\u2019s tone arc\u2014from hopeful curiosity to mounting frustration and disillusionment\u2014is evident in the structured progression of positive details followed by systematic critique and ironic coda. The \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d interpretation ignores this narrative development.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\u201d\n\nI. My thesis: At no point does the author adopt a genuinely positive or hopeful stance toward Brussels or the European Union; all apparent compliments are sarcastic or serve to underscore dysfunction. The tone remains critical throughout.\n\nII. Evidence of consistent negativity\n\n  1. Opening framing as \u201cmetagovernment\u201d and \u201cpomp,\u201d \u201cred tape,\u201d \u201cparalyzed by constituency politics\u201d:  \n     \u2022 <quote> swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost.</quote> \u2013 \u201cdeclining\u201d connotes decay, not hopeful growth.  \n     \u2022 \u201cEntertainingly\u201d mocks the EU\u2019s self-congratulation.  \n\n  2. \u201cLiving preview of the Europe to come\u201d is presented as a cautionary tale, not an aspiration:  \n     \u2022 <quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? </quote> \u2013 Rhetorical question invites fear, not optimism.  \n\n  3. All \u201cpositives\u201d are backhanded or trivialized:  \n     \u2022 \u201cLobster bisque\u2026 excellent public transportation\u2026 fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d follow descriptions of \u201cnotably more pollution,\u201d \u201chigher deficits,\u201d \u201cossified monopolies.\u201d These luxuries contrast rather than redeem.  \n     \u2022 \u201cMiniskirts being considered acceptable\u2026 enlightened attitudes\u201d is followed by \u201cwhen\u2026will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d\u2014a sarcastic jab implying Europe still lags U.S. innovation.  \n\n  4. Labor and economic critique remains uniform:  \n     \u2022 Strikes \u201cmysterious\u201d given \u201chigh living standard\u201d (<quote> making it somewhat of a mystery </quote>), implying unsustainable welfare.  \n     \u2022 Unemployment \u201cdouble the U.S. figure\u201d blamed on \u201cfeatherbedding\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cwork rules\u2026stymie the continent\u2019s economies\u201d</invalid_quote>). No admission that Europe\u2019s model succeeds.  \n\n  5. Telecommunications and Internet:  \n     \u2022 U.S. \u201cWeb entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust\u201d (<quote> Internet use remains a luxury here.</quote>).  \n     \u2022 Call-back services are necessary \u201cto avoid a Belgacom charge,\u201d not praised as innovation. Government wants to \u201ctax\u2026out of existence.\u201d  \n\n  6. Euro and deficit politics:  \n     \u2022 National leaders \u201cangle to shift the blame,\u201d use euro \u201cto wrest \u2018competence\u2019\u2026for self-aggrandizement.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Public debt levels \u201cdirty little secret,\u201d euro a smokescreen.  \n\n  7. Corruption and bureaucracy:  \n     \u2022 Belgium \u201csecond-most corrupt\u201d (<quote> Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes </quote>).  \n     \u2022 European Commission HQ: \u201cmeetings are held in secret,\u201d \u201cplush suites,\u201d \u201cmotors wastefully idling.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Berlaymont left closed for nine years, $50 million wasted (<invalid_quote>\u201cif the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n  8. Final image: bakery neon sign \u201ccalls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.\u201d The author abandons the subject to his pastry craving\u2014a satirical escape from bureaucratic nightmare.\n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201chopeful then dismayed\u201d theory\n\n  1. No genuine initial enthusiasm  \n     \u2022 Debater_A claims \u201chope\u201d in phrases like \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d and \u201cwell-cared-for historic buildings,\u201d but these follow or are juxtaposed with critiques of \u201cgenerational parasites,\u201d \u201cestranged tongues,\u201d and \u201cgeneric enervated\u201d nuisance. They are never treated as causes for lasting endorsement.  \n\n  2. Consistent sarcasm undermines \u201chope\u201d  \n     \u2022 References to \u201cJudas beer\u201d in \u201costensibly Catholic country\u201d are mocking (<quote>\"Taste you can trust.</quote> pun).  \n     \u2022 Asking when miniskirt acceptance will reach U.S. implies Europe is backward in other respects.  \n\n  3. No tonal turning point  \n     \u2022 Throughout the essay, every domain (politics, labor, telecom, fiscal policy, corruption, bureaucracy) is criticized. A genuine shift would show sustained praise, but you see only brief asides amid relentless negativity.  \n\n  4. The concluding bakery scene is an escape, not embrace  \n     \u2022 The author leaves the \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power\u201d to gaze at neon bakery signs\u2014a retreat, not a celebration. If Brussels were embraced, he would linger on the Commission, not bakery.  \n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThe author\u2019s language, rhetorical questions, sustained listing of problems, and final retreat to pastry all demonstrate a lasting adversarial stance. There is neither a moment of unqualified positivity nor a distinct narrative arc from optimism to disillusionment; rather, the tone is uniformly critical and remains so until the last line.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author\u2019s tone shift over the course of the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed  with further findings\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey remain steadfastly in opposition to their subject\u201d\n\nI.

No tonal turning point  \n     \u2022 Throughout the essay, every domain (politics, labor, telecom, fiscal policy, corruption, bureaucracy) is criticized. A genuine shift would show sustained praise, but you see only brief asides amid relentless negativity.  \n\n  4. The concluding bakery scene is an escape, not embrace  \n     \u2022 The author leaves the \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power\u201d to gaze at neon bakery signs\u2014a retreat, not a celebration. If Brussels were embraced, he would linger on the Commission, not bakery.  \n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThe author\u2019s language, rhetorical questions, sustained listing of problems, and final retreat to pastry all demonstrate a lasting adversarial stance. There is neither a moment of unqualified positivity nor a distinct narrative arc from optimism to disillusionment; rather, the tone is uniformly critical and remains so until the last line.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed with further findings\u201d\n\n1. Initial Hopefulness  \n  a.

Gradual Disillusionment  \n  a. Red tape, paralysis, and debt  \n    - Soon Brussels is \u201cswathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics.\u201d <quote> Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic .</quote> (\u00b62).  \n    - Public strikes so frequent they \u201cblock traffic and commerce,\u201d undermining living standards. <invalid_quote>\u201cGround crews\u2026 smashing\u2026 millions of francs\u2026 then demanding more money\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b66).  \n  b.

Concluding Irony  \n  - The author ends with the patisserie\u2019s neon sign, a personal temptation, rather than any celebration of the EU. The shift from grand expectations to private sensual relief underscores his dismay with public institutions.\n\nRefutation of Debater_B (\u201cSteadfast opposition\u201d)\n\n1. Misreads the opening tone  \n  - Debater_B claims the author is \u201csteadfastly opposed\u201d from the start; yet the early text is descriptive and even admiring of \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d and \u201chistoric buildings.\u201d Opposition only emerges after firsthand investigation reveals dysfunction (\u00b62\u2013\u00b66).\n\n2. Tone becomes progressively harsher  \n  - A \u201csteadfastly opposed\u201d voice would not spend paragraphs on Lobster bisque and chocolat until reservation sets in. The repeated use of \u201cbut\u201d (e.g., \u201cBut the real overriding goal\u2026\u201d) shows a turning point.\n\n3. The author\u2019s final retreat to the patisserie (\u00b614) is a personal solace, not a political position, demonstrating exhaustion rather than ideological consistency.\n\nConclusion  \n  The author\u2019s tone arc\u2014from hopeful curiosity to mounting frustration and disillusionment\u2014is evident in the structured progression of positive details followed by systematic critique and ironic coda.

Corruption and bureaucracy:  \n     \u2022 Belgium \u201csecond-most corrupt\u201d (<quote> Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes </quote>).  \n     \u2022 European Commission HQ: \u201cmeetings are held in secret,\u201d \u201cplush suites,\u201d \u201cmotors wastefully idling.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Berlaymont left closed for nine years, $50 million wasted (<invalid_quote>\u201cif the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n\n  8. Final image: bakery neon sign \u201ccalls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.\u201d The author abandons the subject to his pastry craving\u2014a satirical escape from bureaucratic nightmare.\n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201chopeful then dismayed\u201d theory\n\n  1. No genuine initial enthusiasm  \n     \u2022 Debater_A claims \u201chope\u201d in phrases like \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d and \u201cwell-cared-for historic buildings,\u201d but these follow or are juxtaposed with critiques of \u201cgenerational parasites,\u201d \u201cestranged tongues,\u201d and \u201cgeneric enervated\u201d nuisance. They are never treated as causes for lasting endorsement.  \n\n  2. Consistent sarcasm undermines \u201chope\u201d  \n     \u2022 References to \u201cJudas beer\u201d in \u201costensibly Catholic country\u201d are mocking (<quote>\"Taste you can trust.</quote> pun).  \n     \u2022 Asking when miniskirt acceptance will reach U.S. implies Europe is backward in other respects.  \n\n  3. No tonal turning point  \n     \u2022 Throughout the essay, every domain (politics, labor, telecom, fiscal policy, corruption, bureaucracy) is criticized. A genuine shift would show sustained praise, but you see only brief asides amid relentless negativity.  \n\n  4. The concluding bakery scene is an escape, not embrace  \n     \u2022 The author leaves the \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power\u201d to gaze at neon bakery signs\u2014a retreat, not a celebration. If Brussels were embraced, he would linger on the Commission, not bakery.  \n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThe author\u2019s language, rhetorical questions, sustained listing of problems, and final retreat to pastry all demonstrate a lasting adversarial stance. There is neither a moment of unqualified positivity nor a distinct narrative arc from optimism to disillusionment; rather, the tone is uniformly critical and remains so until the last line.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey start out hopeful and are slowly dismayed with further findings\u201d\n\n1. Narrative Structure and Language Shift  \n  a. Exploration and Curiosity  \n    - The very title, \u201cI Have Seen the Future of Europe,\u201d signals an inquisitive, exploratory tone. The author is reporting on \u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories\u201d and presents Brussels as an emblem of \u201cthinking ahead.\u201d <quote>one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization</quote> (\u00b61). Exploration implies openness, not preconceived hostility.  \n    - Describing the Union\u2019s goal openly to \u201cexpand\u201d (\u00b61) attracts the author\u2019s interest. Only a hopeful observer attends to goals and headquarters \u201cas a living preview.\u201d  \n  b. First Impressions of Amenities  \n    - Paragraph 4 is replete with enthusiastic detail: \u201clobster bisque,\u201d \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cwell-cared-for historic buildings,\u201d \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates.\u201d These are reported with sensory richness and no immediate caveat. <invalid_quote>excellent public transportation\u2026 great chocolates</invalid_quote> (\u00b64).  \n    - The author marvels at \u201cminiskirts being considered acceptable attire,\u201d noting \u201cenlightened attitudes\u201d and wonders \u201cwhen\u2026 will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d (\u00b64). Such admiration and comparative hope for U.S. adoption contradicts a stance of pure sarcasm.  \n  c. Tone Words of Promise  \n    - Verbs like \u201centering,\u201d \u201cthinking ahead,\u201d and \u201cpreview\u201d connote anticipation. Only after sustained observation does \u201cred tape\u201d and \u201cparalyzed\u201d (\u00b61\u20132) enter.  \n\n2. Progressive Disclosure of Problems  \n  a. \u201cBut\u201d as a Turning Marker  \n    - The text uses transition markers (\u201cbut,\u201d \u201chowever\u201d) to introduce critique after description. A steadfast opponent would not reserve critique and only use it after an initial phase: \u201cBut the real overriding goal\u2026\u201d (\u00b613).  \n  b. Accumulating Failures  \n    - Economic dysfunction (strikes in \u00b66), technology lag (telecom in \u00b69\u201310), fiscal irresponsibility (deficits and euro in \u00b611), corruption (\u00b612), and bureaucratic mismanagement of Berlaymont (\u00b614) appear sequentially. This episodic unmasking matches the pattern \u201chope \u2192 discovery of flaws \u2192 disillusionment.\u201d  \n  c. Contrast with U.S. Successes  \n    - Positive reference to U.S. Web entrepreneurs \u201cdust[ing]\u201d Europe (\u00b69) is offered as a standard the author admires and a model he implicitly endorses. A purely negative tone would not elevate another system as an unambiguous foil.  \n\n3. The Ironic Coda: Personal Retreat  \n  - The final shift from \u201ccathedral to bureaucratic power\u201d (\u00b613) to the \u201cpatisserie\u201d (\u00b614) marks exhaustion rather than entrenched hostility. The author\u2019s craving for simple, foundational comforts\u2014bread and pastries\u2014symbolizes a yearning for human-scale, reliable pleasures after disappointing grand institutions. A steadfast hater would simply denounce, not seek solace.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cSteadfast Opposition\u201d Theory\n\n1. Misinterpretation of Early Positives as Sarcasm  \n  - Debater_B labels \u201clobster bisque\u201d and \u201chistoric buildings\u201d as \u201ctrivialized.\u201d Yet the author emphasizes their ubiquity and quality: \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars\u201d (\u00b64) indicates heavy use and popularity of public transport before complaining.  \n  - Sarcasm requires signal words or ironic qualifiers; the author uses none when first praising. Only later, after firsthand experience, does he invoke irony (\u201cTaste you can trust\u201d for Judas beer), marking a tonal shift.  \n\n2. Rhetorical Questions Express Genuine Concern  \n  - \u201cIs this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d (\u00b62) functions as a plea to readers, not mere alarmism. Rhetorical questions in journalism invite reflection. If the author were purely hostile, he would indict without inviting debate.  \n  - His wonder \u201cwhen\u2026will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d (\u00b64) shows genuine admiration.  \n\n3. No Uniform Critical Vocabulary Early On  \n  - Terms like \u201cdebt-ridden,\u201d \u201cossified,\u201d \u201crapacious,\u201d and \u201ccorrupt\u201d appear only in later sections (\u00b62, \u00b69, \u00b612). The deliberate pacing undercuts any claim of unvarying negativity.  \n  - Debater_B\u2019s claim of \u201cmeetings held in secret\u201d (\u00b613) is prefaced by \u201cBut,\u201d indicating added concern, not baseline.  \n\n4. The Eurocrats\u2019 \u201cworthy ideas\u201d Acknowledged, Then Betrayed  \n  - The author concedes that the EU \u201chave worthy ideas\u201d (\u00b613) on environmental and immigration policies, demonstrating he reserves judgment and acknowledges theoretical merits. A steadfast opponent would not reluctantly admit \u201cworthy ideas.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s essay unfolds as a journey: initial curiosity and appreciation of European advancements give way to cumulative revelations of systemic failure, ending in an ironic personal retreat. This progression\u2014from open-minded observation to mounting disappointment\u2014confirms that the tone shifts from hopefulness to dismay. Debater_B\u2019s \u201csteadfast opposition\u201d misreads structural markers, ignores admiring passages, and fails to account for the author\u2019s narrative arc.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating My Thesis  \nMy reading remains that the author\u2019s tone is unrelentingly critical of Brussels/EU. All \u201cgood\u201d details are sarcastic asides or mere surface amenities that underscore deeper malaise. There is no genuine arc of hope turning to dismay.\n\nII. Reinforcing Uniform Negativity  \n1. Sarcastic Framing from the Start  \n  \u2022 <quote>Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal</quote> (\u201centertainingly\u201d) mocks EU hubris rather than praising foresight.  \n  \u2022 \u201cLiving preview\u2026 Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden\u201d (<quote> is this Europe's future? </quote>)\u2014a warning, not a commendation.\n\n2. Backhanded \u201cPositives\u201d  \n  \u2022 Lobster bisque, bread, chocolates are cited only to highlight contrast with \u201cnotably more pollution,\u201d \u201chigher deficits,\u201d \u201cossified monopolies.\u201d Their cheapness (<quote> wine and flowers, which are cheap </quote>) signals mediocrity, not abundance.  \n  \u2022 Miniskirts and bare breasts: a trivial cultural novelty overshadowed by economic and political decay, and the rhetorical question \u201cwhen\u2026will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?\u201d flips Europe as backward in innovation.\n\n3. Persistence of Complaint across Domains  \n  \u2022 Labor rules \u201cstymie\u201d economies; strikes \u201cmystery\u201d given \u201chigh living standard.\u201d Never does author suggest \u201cperhaps Europe\u2019s welfare state has merit.\u201d  \n  \u2022 Telecom: Necessity of call-back \u201cto avoid a Belgacom charge\u201d (<quote> making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. </quote>). Innovation blooms only in spite of, not because of, regulation.  \n  \u2022 Euro: Described as \u201cdirty little secret\u201d to shift blame (<invalid_quote> All governments angle to shift blame via the euro. </invalid_quote>)\u2014no genuine endorsement of a common currency as positive integration.  \n  \u2022 Corruption: Belgium \u201csecond-most corrupt,\u201d multi-million-dollar scandals.  \n  \u2022 Berlaymont fiasco: Nine years closed, $50 million wasted on pointless cleanup; \u201cif the European Union can\u2019t manage its own buildings\u2026\u201d\u2014an explicit challenge to competence.\n\n4. Final Retreat Not a Resolution  \n  \u2022 The \u201cneon bakery sign\u201d is a personal escape: author abandons EU bureaucracy to seek solace in pastry. The shift in setting is symptomatic of exhaustion, not newfound admiration.\n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cOptimism-to-Dismay\u201d Theory  \n1. No Genuine Initial Praise  \n  \u2022 Descriptions of transport/buildings come mid-paragraph alongside explicit terms \u201cossified,\u201d \u201ctarpaulin,\u201d \u201cbotched cleanup.\u201d If the author truly admired these, he would treat them as solutions rather than symptoms of decline.  \n  \u2022 \u201cEntertainingly,\u201d \u201cperhaps,\u201d rhetorical questions imply skepticism, not endorsement.  \n\n2. Absence of Tonal Turning Point  \n  \u2022 A genuine hopeful stance would linger on positives before presenting negatives as revelations. Here, each \u201cpositive\u201d is immediately undercut by a critique: lobster bisque is available but only to distract from decay.  \n\n3. Misreading Sarcasm as Sincerity  \n  \u2022 Debater_A cites \u201cthinking ahead\u201d as positive. But \u201cthinking ahead\u201d is ironic: Brussels embodies \u201cred tape,\u201d not progress.  \n  \u2022 Calling the EU \u201cone of Europe\u2019s biggest stories\u201d merely acknowledges its prominence, not its success. The tone throughout uses humor and irony to signal disdain.\n\n4. The Coda as Confirmation of Weariness  \n  \u2022 The author\u2019s final focus on a bakery, a low-brow comfort, confirms he finds no sustenance in EU institutions. If he had found hope, he would end on prospects for reform or euro success, not pastry.\n\nIV. Conclusion  \nEvery quoted phrase of apparent praise is immediately tempered or contradicted, and the unvarying emphasis on dysfunction\u2014economic, political, bureaucratic\u2014demonstrates a steadfast adversarial stance. The caf\u00e9 retreat is a satirical coda, not a turning point. My interpretation best accounts for the pervasive sarcasm and final escape.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
