Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nHER ONLY PASSION WAS BEAUTY\u2014BEAUTY WHICH WOULD LAST FOREVER.  AND FOR IT\u2014SHE'D DO ANYTHING!\n\n Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike  in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her  couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.  There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.\n\n\n It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness  in them, but only she knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her  polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth  they once had, only she knew that, too. But they would again , she  told herself fiercely.\n\n\n She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a  frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns\u2014just one  frown\u2014could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.  One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and  there\u2014the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing  them.\n\n\n Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial  surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the  stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a  figure where they were beginning to blur and\u2014sag.\n\n\n No one else could see it\u2014yet. But Ninon could!\n\n\n Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the  back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and  destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as  circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.  Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old  philosopher had said, \"If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\" Crude, but apt.\n\n\n Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to  feel that sureness of power in her grasp\u2014the certain knowledge that  she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She  would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like  a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of  the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew  how.\n\n\n Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment  through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the  lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of  endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them  contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave  them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.\n\n\n There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A  book. \"Time in Relation to Time.\" The name of the author, his academic  record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his  postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her  was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For  Ninon!\n\n\n The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch\u2014Robert  was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was  behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her  figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and  opened it.\n\n\n A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with  the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step  forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.\n\n\n \"Ninon, my darling,\" he whispered huskily.\n\n\n Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed  her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the  years, it had deepened.\n\n\n \"Not yet, Robert,\" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm  resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening  flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such  experiences with men had given her.\n\n\n Then, \"Come in, Robert,\" she said, moving back a step. \"I've been  waiting for you.\"\n\n\n She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready  for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed  the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside  the young spaceman on the silken couch.\n\n\n His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced  each other.\n\n\n \"Ninon,\" he said, \"you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long  time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"\n\n\n Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny  pout. \"If you could just take me with you, Robert....\"\n\n\n Robert's face clouded. \"If I only could!\" he said wistfully. \"If there  were only room. But this is an experimental flight\u2014no more than two can  go.\"\n\n\n Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" Ninon said, pushing him back.\n\n\n \"Wait? Wait for what?\" Robert glanced at his watch. \"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"But that's three hours, Robert.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should  rest a little.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be more than rest for you.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, darling.\" Again her hands were between them. \"First, tell me  about the flight tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. \"But Ninon, I've told you  before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little  time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....\"\n\n\n Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away  from him. But he blundered on.\n\n\n \"... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you  know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only  rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind  of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light\u2014how many times  faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the  first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it  works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Will it work?\" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her  voice.\n\n\n Robert said, hesitantly, \"We think it will. I'll know better by this  time tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"What of you\u2014of me\u2014. What does this mean to us\u2014to people?\"\n\n\n Again the young spaceman hesitated. \"We ... we don't know, yet. We think  that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....\"\n\n\n \"... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Well ... yes. Something like that.\"\n\n\n \"And I'll be\u2014old\u2014or dead, when you get back? If you get back?\"\n\n\n Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair  which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.\n\n\n \"Don't say it, darling,\" he murmured.\n\n\n This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,  and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no  wrinkles\u2014there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and  flexible, of real youth.\n\n\n She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three  buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of  glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact  rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.\n\n\n Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. \"What were those clicks?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Ninon's arms stole around his neck. \"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a  little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....\"\n\n\n The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not  quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would.... Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The  lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all  that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's  tousled hair and shook him gently.\n\n\n \"It's time to go, Robert,\" she said.\n\n\n Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. \"So soon?\" he  mumbled.\n\n\n \"And I'm going with you,\" Ninon said.\n\n\n This brought him fully awake. \"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\" He sat up  and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he  reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.\n\n\n Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.  \"How old are you?\"\n\n\n \"I've told you before, darling\u2014twenty-four.\"\n\n\n \"How old do you think I am?\"\n\n\n He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, \"Come to  think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.\"\n\n\n \"Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.\"\n\n\n He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the  smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he  chuckled. \"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You  can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.\"\n\n\n Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: \"I am fifty-two years old. I  knew your father, before you were born.\"\n\n\n This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy  to read on his face while he struggled to speak. \"Then ... God help  me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!\" His voice was low,  bitter, accusing.\n\n\n Ninon slapped him.\n\n\n He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her  fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and  said, \"Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"\n\n\n For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand  sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds  of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said in peremptory tones.\n\n\n The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to  conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!\"\n\n\n Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains  at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life  on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and  color and sound and dimension, she\u2014and Robert\u2014projected themselves,  together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the  three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in  the hair falling over her shoulders....\n\n\n The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. \"So that's  it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.  But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be  gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,  permanently\u2014at your age\u2014before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"\n\n\n Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. \"On the  contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,  more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were  to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business  to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He  too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A  third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are  supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of  Space Research knew that you had not....\"\n\n\n \"I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less  than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to  make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....\"\n\n\n Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen  changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the  couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,  uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were  around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording  run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.\n\n\n To Robert, she said, \"I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five  minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously  affects the success of the flight.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long  moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, \"You  scheming witch! What do you want?\"\n\n\n There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.  Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out  through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street  where his car waited.\n\n\n \"We must hurry,\" she said breathlessly. \"We can get to the spaceship  ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from  Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his  place.\"\n\n\n Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and  waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the  curb and through the streets to the spaceport.\n\n\n Ninon said, \"Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from  Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it  would still be running but it would never show later time?\"\n\n\n The young man said gruffly, \"Roughly so, according to theory.\"\n\n\n \"And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,  wouldn't it run backwards?\"\n\n\n The answer was curtly cautious. \"It might appear to.\"\n\n\n \"Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\"\n\n\n Robert flicked a curious glance at her. \"If you could watch them from  Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....\"\n\n\n Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. \"And if people  travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't  they?\"\n\n\n Robert said, \"So that's what's in your mind.\" He busied himself with  parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: \"You want to go back in  the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,  into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....\"\n\n\n \"I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,  his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, \"Come on,\" he  said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which  poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And  added, \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"\n\n\n The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did  not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and  almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;  and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in  her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No  more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or  frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and  again.... The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into  the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy  asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale  Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,  flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on  out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars  were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes\u2014eyes  staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,  stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.\n\n\n The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon  lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\n\n\n Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of  the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already  seated at the controls.\n\n\n \"How fast are we going?\" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.\n\n\n \"Barely crawling, astronomically,\" he said shortly. \"About forty-six  thousand miles a minute.\"\n\n\n \"Is that as fast as the speed of light?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly, Madame,\" he said, with a condescending chuckle.\n\n\n \"Then make it go faster!\" she screamed. \"And faster and faster\u2014hurry!  What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\n The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and  drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon  could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She  felt tired, hating herself for it\u2014hating having this young man see  her.\n\n\n He said, \"The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is  plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can  do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"\n\n\n \"Time! Wait! That's all I hear!\" Ninon shrieked. \"Do something!\"\n\n\n Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of  audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a  nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning  fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and  up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she  stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was  still there. The light drive!\n\n\n She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving  now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the  galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant  slingshot.\n\n\n She asked, \"How fast are we going now?\"\n\n\n Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, \"We are approaching the  speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"Make it go faster!\" she cried. \"Faster! Faster!\"\n\n\n She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them\u2014and saw shining  specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness  of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars  dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.\n\n\n \"Now how fast are we going?\" she asked. She was sure that her voice was  stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.\n\n\n \"Nearly twice light speed.\"\n\n\n \"Faster!\" she cried. \"We must go much faster! I must be young again.  Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel  younger yet?\"\n\n\n He did not answer. Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and\u2014she  knew\u2014youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.  How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She  would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the  stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again\u2014it was just from  lying in the sling so long.\n\n\n She made her voice light and gay. \"Are we not going very, very fast,  now, Robert?\"\n\n\n He answered without turning. \"Yes. Many times the speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it  too?\"\n\n\n He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. \"How long have we been  going, Robert?\"\n\n\n He said, \"I don't know ... depends on where you are.\"\n\n\n \"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I  am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good  appetites, don't they, Robert?\"\n\n\n He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it  ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. It's the excitement , she  told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the  years to be young again.... Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day  when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the  springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through  the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to  wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the  halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,  uncounted light-years behind them\u2014or before them. And she would still  continue to grow younger and younger....\n\n\n She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the  far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. \"You are  looking much younger, Robert,\" she said. \"Yes, I think you are becoming  quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.\"\n\n\n He nodded slightly. \"You may be right,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I must have a mirror,\" she cried. \"I must see for myself how much  younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....\"\n\n\n \"There is no mirror,\" he told her.\n\n\n \"No mirror? But how can I see....\"\n\n\n \"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"\n\n\n The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. \"Then you shall be my  mirror,\" she said. \"Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not  becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable  of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.\"\n\n\n He said, \"I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting  data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin  to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as  comfortable as possible.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n Robert said, coldly brutal, \"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"\n\n\n Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And  watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike  the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which  rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only  a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as  its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,  discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film  of dust over all. After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the  wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make  the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She  polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection  of her face in the rubbed spot.\n\n\n Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time  was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that  Robert was gone\u2014there would be many young men, men her own age, when  she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and  be ready.\n\n\n The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it  found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its  way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the  port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she  could not see that they had\u2014only she had changed\u2014until Saturn loomed  up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.  But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,  frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell  behind. Next would be Mars....\n\n\n But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen  before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids  had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a  mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had  plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?\n\n\n But no matter\u2014she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And  wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she  told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!\n\n\n She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,  closed her eyes, and waited. The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar  of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame  died away\u2014and the ship\u2014and Ninon\u2014rested, quietly, serenely, while the  rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe  distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the  brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where. There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation. \"The ship is from Maris, the red planet,\" someone said. And another: \"No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is  pitted\u2014it has traveled from afar.\" An old man cried: \"It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.\" A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for  safety, watching with alert curiosity. Then an engineer ventured close, and said, \"The workmanship is similar  to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is  obviously not of our Aerth.\" And a savant said, \"Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a  parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples  like us.\" Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid  forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd  attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their  ground. And the braver ones moved closer. But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At  last the crowd surged forward again. Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot  of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each  other. She said, \"I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far  space on such a ship as that.\" He squeezed her hand and said, \"We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will  come, in our time, they've always said\u2014and there is the proof of it.\" The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. \"You'll be  one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?\" He slipped an arm around her. \"Of course. You know, Nina, our  scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light  one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,  very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!\" Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the  ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and  Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report. They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. \"There is no one  alive on the ship,\" they cried. \"Only an old, withered, white-haired  lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have  lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,  indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy\u2014for there is a smile  on her face.\" ",

Gordon [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Orbit volume 1 number  2, 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nHER ONLY PASSION WAS BEAUTY\u2014BEAUTY WHICH WOULD LAST FOREVER.  AND FOR IT\u2014SHE'D DO ANYTHING!\n\n Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike  in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her  couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.  There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.\n\n\n It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness  in them, but only she knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her  polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth  they once had, only she knew that, too. But they would again , she  told herself fiercely.\n\n\n She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a  frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns\u2014just one  frown\u2014could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.  One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and  there\u2014the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing  them.\n\n\n Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial  surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the  stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a  figure where they were beginning to blur and\u2014sag.\n\n\n No one else could see it\u2014yet. But Ninon could!\n\n\n Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the  back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and  destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as  circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.  Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old  philosopher had said, \"If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\" Crude, but apt.\n\n\n Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to  feel that sureness of power in her grasp\u2014the certain knowledge that  she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She  would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like  a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of  the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew  how.\n\n\n Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment  through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the  lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of  endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them  contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave  them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.\n\n\n There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A  book. \"Time in Relation to Time.\" The name of the author, his academic  record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his  postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her  was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For  Ninon!\n\n\n The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch\u2014Robert  was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was  behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her  figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and  opened it.\n\n\n A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with  the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step  forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.\n\n\n \"Ninon, my darling,\" he whispered huskily.\n\n\n Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed  her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the  years, it had deepened.\n\n\n \"Not yet, Robert,\" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm  resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening  flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such  experiences with men had given her.\n\n\n Then, \"Come in, Robert,\" she said, moving back a step. \"I've been  waiting for you.\"\n\n\n She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready  for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed  the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside  the young spaceman on the silken couch.\n\n\n His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced  each other.\n\n\n \"Ninon,\" he said, \"you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long  time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"\n\n\n Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny  pout. \"If you could just take me with you, Robert....\"\n\n\n Robert's face clouded. \"If I only could!\" he said wistfully. \"If there  were only room. But this is an experimental flight\u2014no more than two can  go.\"\n\n\n Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" Ninon said, pushing him back.\n\n\n \"Wait? Wait for what?\" Robert glanced at his watch. \"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"But that's three hours, Robert.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should  rest a little.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be more than rest for you.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, darling.\" Again her hands were between them. \"First, tell me  about the flight tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. \"But Ninon, I've told you  before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little  time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....\"\n\n\n Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away  from him. But he blundered on.\n\n\n \"... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you  know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only  rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind  of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light\u2014how many times  faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the  first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it  works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Will it work?\" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her  voice.\n\n\n Robert said, hesitantly, \"We think it will. I'll know better by this  time tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"What of you\u2014of me\u2014. What does this mean to us\u2014to people?\"\n\n\n Again the young spaceman hesitated. \"We ... we don't know, yet. We think  that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....\"\n\n\n \"... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Well ... yes. Something like that.\"\n\n\n \"And I'll be\u2014old\u2014or dead, when you get back? If you get back?\"\n\n\n Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair  which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.\n\n\n \"Don't say it, darling,\" he murmured.\n\n\n This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,  and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no  wrinkles\u2014there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and  flexible, of real youth.\n\n\n She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three  buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of  glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact  rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.\n\n\n Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. \"What were those clicks?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Ninon's arms stole around his neck. \"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a  little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....\"\n\n\n The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not  quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would.... Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The  lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all  that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's  tousled hair and shook him gently.\n\n\n \"It's time to go, Robert,\" she said.\n\n\n Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. \"So soon?\" he  mumbled.\n\n\n \"And I'm going with you,\" Ninon said.\n\n\n This brought him fully awake. \"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\" He sat up  and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he  reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.\n\n\n Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.  \"How old are you?\"\n\n\n \"I've told you before, darling\u2014twenty-four.\"\n\n\n \"How old do you think I am?\"\n\n\n He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, \"Come to  think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.\"\n\n\n \"Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.\"\n\n\n He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the  smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he  chuckled. \"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You  can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.\"\n\n\n Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: \"I am fifty-two years old. I  knew your father, before you were born.\"\n\n\n This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy  to read on his face while he struggled to speak. \"Then ... God help  me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!\" His voice was low,  bitter, accusing.\n\n\n Ninon slapped him.\n\n\n He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her  fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and  said, \"Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"\n\n\n For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand  sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds  of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said in peremptory tones.\n\n\n The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to  conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!\"\n\n\n Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains  at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life  on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and  color and sound and dimension, she\u2014and Robert\u2014projected themselves,  together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the  three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in  the hair falling over her shoulders....\n\n\n The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. \"So that's  it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.  But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be  gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,  permanently\u2014at your age\u2014before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"\n\n\n Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. \"On the  contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,  more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were  to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business  to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He  too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A  third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are  supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of  Space Research knew that you had not....\"\n\n\n \"I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less  than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to  make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....\"\n\n\n Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen  changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the  couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,  uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were  around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording  run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.\n\n\n To Robert, she said, \"I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five  minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously  affects the success of the flight.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long  moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, \"You  scheming witch! What do you want?\"\n\n\n There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.  Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out  through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street  where his car waited.\n\n\n \"We must hurry,\" she said breathlessly. \"We can get to the spaceship  ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from  Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his  place.\"\n\n\n Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and  waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the  curb and through the streets to the spaceport.\n\n\n Ninon said, \"Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from  Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it  would still be running but it would never show later time?\"\n\n\n The young man said gruffly, \"Roughly so, according to theory.\"\n\n\n \"And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,  wouldn't it run backwards?\"\n\n\n The answer was curtly cautious. \"It might appear to.\"\n\n\n \"Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\"\n\n\n Robert flicked a curious glance at her. \"If you could watch them from  Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....\"\n\n\n Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. \"And if people  travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't  they?\"\n\n\n Robert said, \"So that's what's in your mind.\" He busied himself with  parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: \"You want to go back in  the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,  into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....\"\n\n\n \"I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,  his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, \"Come on,\" he  said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which  poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And  added, \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"\n\n\n The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did  not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and  almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;  and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in  her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No  more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or  frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and  again.... The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into  the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy  asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale  Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,  flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on  out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars  were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes\u2014eyes  staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,  stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.\n\n\n The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon  lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\n\n\n Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of  the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already  seated at the controls.\n\n\n \"How fast are we going?\" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.\n\n\n \"Barely crawling, astronomically,\" he said shortly. \"About forty-six  thousand miles a minute.\"\n\n\n \"Is that as fast as the speed of light?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly, Madame,\" he said, with a condescending chuckle.\n\n\n \"Then make it go faster!\" she screamed. \"And faster and faster\u2014hurry!  What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\n The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and  drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon  could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She  felt tired, hating herself for it\u2014hating having this young man see  her.\n\n\n He said, \"The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is  plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can  do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"\n\n\n \"Time! Wait! That's all I hear!\" Ninon shrieked. \"Do something!\"\n\n\n Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of  audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a  nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning  fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and  up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she  stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was  still there. The light drive!\n\n\n She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving  now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the  galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant  slingshot.\n\n\n She asked, \"How fast are we going now?\"\n\n\n Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, \"We are approaching the  speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"Make it go faster!\" she cried. \"Faster! Faster!\"\n\n\n She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them\u2014and saw shining  specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness  of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars  dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.\n\n\n \"Now how fast are we going?\" she asked. She was sure that her voice was  stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.\n\n\n \"Nearly twice light speed.\"\n\n\n \"Faster!\" she cried. \"We must go much faster! I must be young again.  Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel  younger yet?\"\n\n\n He did not answer. Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and\u2014she  knew\u2014youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.  How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She  would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the  stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again\u2014it was just from  lying in the sling so long.\n\n\n She made her voice light and gay. \"Are we not going very, very fast,  now, Robert?\"\n\n\n He answered without turning. \"Yes. Many times the speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it  too?\"\n\n\n He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. \"How long have we been  going, Robert?\"\n\n\n He said, \"I don't know ... depends on where you are.\"\n\n\n \"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I  am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good  appetites, don't they, Robert?\"\n\n\n He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it  ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. It's the excitement , she  told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the  years to be young again.... Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day  when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the  springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through  the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to  wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the  halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,  uncounted light-years behind them\u2014or before them. And she would still  continue to grow younger and younger....\n\n\n She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the  far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. \"You are  looking much younger, Robert,\" she said. \"Yes, I think you are becoming  quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.\"\n\n\n He nodded slightly. \"You may be right,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I must have a mirror,\" she cried. \"I must see for myself how much  younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....\"\n\n\n \"There is no mirror,\" he told her.\n\n\n \"No mirror? But how can I see....\"\n\n\n \"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"\n\n\n The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. \"Then you shall be my  mirror,\" she said. \"Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not  becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable  of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.\"\n\n\n He said, \"I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting  data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin  to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as  comfortable as possible.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n Robert said, coldly brutal, \"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"\n\n\n Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And  watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike  the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which  rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only  a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as  its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,  discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film  of dust over all. After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the  wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make  the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She  polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection  of her face in the rubbed spot.\n\n\n Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time  was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that  Robert was gone\u2014there would be many young men, men her own age, when  she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and  be ready.\n\n\n The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it  found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its  way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the  port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she  could not see that they had\u2014only she had changed\u2014until Saturn loomed  up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.  But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,  frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell  behind. Next would be Mars....\n\n\n But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen  before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids  had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a  mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had  plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?\n\n\n But no matter\u2014she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And  wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she  told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!\n\n\n She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,  closed her eyes, and waited. The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar  of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame  died away\u2014and the ship\u2014and Ninon\u2014rested, quietly, serenely, while the  rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe  distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the  brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where. There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation. \"The ship is from Maris, the red planet,\" someone said. And another: \"No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is  pitted\u2014it has traveled from afar.\" An old man cried: \"It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.\" A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for  safety, watching with alert curiosity. Then an engineer ventured close, and said, \"The workmanship is similar  to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is  obviously not of our Aerth.\" And a savant said, \"Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a  parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples  like us.\" Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid  forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd  attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their  ground. And the braver ones moved closer. But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At  last the crowd surged forward again. Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot  of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each  other. She said, \"I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far  space on such a ship as that.\" He squeezed her hand and said, \"We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will  come, in our time, they've always said\u2014and there is the proof of it.\" The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. \"You'll be  one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?\" He slipped an arm around her. \"Of course. You know, Nina, our  scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light  one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,  very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!\" Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the  ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and  Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report. They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. \"There is no one  alive on the ship,\" they cried. \"Only an old, withered, white-haired  lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have  lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,  indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy\u2014for there is a smile  on her face.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Robert want to go to space?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"We don\u2019t know for sure from the story\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and fly to space like him\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and fly to space like him\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and fly to space like him\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Gordon [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Orbit volume 1 number  2, 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nHER ONLY PASSION WAS BEAUTY\u2014BEAUTY WHICH WOULD LAST FOREVER.  AND FOR IT\u2014SHE'D DO ANYTHING!\n\n Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike  in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her  couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.  There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.\n\n\n It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness  in them, but only she knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her  polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth  they once had, only she knew that, too. But they would again , she  told herself fiercely.\n\n\n She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a  frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns\u2014just one  frown\u2014could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.  One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and  there\u2014the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing  them.\n\n\n Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial  surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the  stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a  figure where they were beginning to blur and\u2014sag.\n\n\n No one else could see it\u2014yet. But Ninon could!\n\n\n Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the  back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and  destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as  circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.  Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old  philosopher had said, \"If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\" Crude, but apt.\n\n\n Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to  feel that sureness of power in her grasp\u2014the certain knowledge that  she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She  would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like  a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of  the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew  how.\n\n\n Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment  through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the  lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of  endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them  contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave  them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.\n\n\n There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A  book. \"Time in Relation to Time.\" The name of the author, his academic  record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his  postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her  was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For  Ninon!\n\n\n The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch\u2014Robert  was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was  behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her  figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and  opened it.\n\n\n A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with  the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step  forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.\n\n\n \"Ninon, my darling,\" he whispered huskily.\n\n\n Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed  her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the  years, it had deepened.\n\n\n \"Not yet, Robert,\" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm  resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening  flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such  experiences with men had given her.\n\n\n Then, \"Come in, Robert,\" she said, moving back a step. \"I've been  waiting for you.\"\n\n\n She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready  for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed  the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside  the young spaceman on the silken couch.\n\n\n His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced  each other.\n\n\n \"Ninon,\" he said, \"you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long  time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"\n\n\n Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny  pout. \"If you could just take me with you, Robert....\"\n\n\n Robert's face clouded. \"If I only could!\" he said wistfully. \"If there  were only room. But this is an experimental flight\u2014no more than two can  go.\"\n\n\n Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" Ninon said, pushing him back.\n\n\n \"Wait? Wait for what?\" Robert glanced at his watch. \"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"But that's three hours, Robert.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should  rest a little.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be more than rest for you.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, darling.\" Again her hands were between them. \"First, tell me  about the flight tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. \"But Ninon, I've told you  before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little  time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....\"\n\n\n Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away  from him. But he blundered on.\n\n\n \"... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you  know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only  rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind  of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light\u2014how many times  faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the  first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it  works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Will it work?\" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her  voice.\n\n\n Robert said, hesitantly, \"We think it will. I'll know better by this  time tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"What of you\u2014of me\u2014. What does this mean to us\u2014to people?\"\n\n\n Again the young spaceman hesitated. \"We ... we don't know, yet. We think  that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....\"\n\n\n \"... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Well ... yes. Something like that.\"\n\n\n \"And I'll be\u2014old\u2014or dead, when you get back? If you get back?\"\n\n\n Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair  which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.\n\n\n \"Don't say it, darling,\" he murmured.\n\n\n This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,  and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no  wrinkles\u2014there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and  flexible, of real youth.\n\n\n She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three  buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of  glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact  rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.\n\n\n Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. \"What were those clicks?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Ninon's arms stole around his neck. \"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a  little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....\"\n\n\n The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not  quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would.... Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The  lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all  that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's  tousled hair and shook him gently.\n\n\n \"It's time to go, Robert,\" she said.\n\n\n Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. \"So soon?\" he  mumbled.\n\n\n \"And I'm going with you,\" Ninon said.\n\n\n This brought him fully awake. \"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\" He sat up  and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he  reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.\n\n\n Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.  \"How old are you?\"\n\n\n \"I've told you before, darling\u2014twenty-four.\"\n\n\n \"How old do you think I am?\"\n\n\n He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, \"Come to  think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.\"\n\n\n \"Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.\"\n\n\n He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the  smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he  chuckled. \"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You  can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.\"\n\n\n Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: \"I am fifty-two years old. I  knew your father, before you were born.\"\n\n\n This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy  to read on his face while he struggled to speak. \"Then ... God help  me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!\" His voice was low,  bitter, accusing.\n\n\n Ninon slapped him.\n\n\n He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her  fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and  said, \"Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"\n\n\n For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand  sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds  of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said in peremptory tones.\n\n\n The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to  conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!\"\n\n\n Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains  at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life  on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and  color and sound and dimension, she\u2014and Robert\u2014projected themselves,  together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the  three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in  the hair falling over her shoulders....\n\n\n The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. \"So that's  it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.  But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be  gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,  permanently\u2014at your age\u2014before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"\n\n\n Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. \"On the  contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,  more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were  to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business  to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He  too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A  third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are  supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of  Space Research knew that you had not....\"\n\n\n \"I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less  than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to  make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....\"\n\n\n Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen  changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the  couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,  uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were  around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording  run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.\n\n\n To Robert, she said, \"I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five  minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously  affects the success of the flight.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long  moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, \"You  scheming witch! What do you want?\"\n\n\n There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.  Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out  through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street  where his car waited.\n\n\n \"We must hurry,\" she said breathlessly. \"We can get to the spaceship  ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from  Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his  place.\"\n\n\n Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and  waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the  curb and through the streets to the spaceport.\n\n\n Ninon said, \"Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from  Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it  would still be running but it would never show later time?\"\n\n\n The young man said gruffly, \"Roughly so, according to theory.\"\n\n\n \"And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,  wouldn't it run backwards?\"\n\n\n The answer was curtly cautious. \"It might appear to.\"\n\n\n \"Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\"\n\n\n Robert flicked a curious glance at her. \"If you could watch them from  Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....\"\n\n\n Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. \"And if people  travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't  they?\"\n\n\n Robert said, \"So that's what's in your mind.\" He busied himself with  parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: \"You want to go back in  the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,  into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....\"\n\n\n \"I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,  his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, \"Come on,\" he  said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which  poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And  added, \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"\n\n\n The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did  not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and  almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;  and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in  her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No  more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or  frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and  again.... The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into  the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy  asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale  Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,  flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on  out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars  were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes\u2014eyes  staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,  stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.\n\n\n The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon  lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\n\n\n Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of  the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already  seated at the controls.\n\n\n \"How fast are we going?\" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.\n\n\n \"Barely crawling, astronomically,\" he said shortly. \"About forty-six  thousand miles a minute.\"\n\n\n \"Is that as fast as the speed of light?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly, Madame,\" he said, with a condescending chuckle.\n\n\n \"Then make it go faster!\" she screamed. \"And faster and faster\u2014hurry!  What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\n The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and  drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon  could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She  felt tired, hating herself for it\u2014hating having this young man see  her.\n\n\n He said, \"The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is  plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can  do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"\n\n\n \"Time! Wait! That's all I hear!\" Ninon shrieked. \"Do something!\"\n\n\n Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of  audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a  nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning  fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and  up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she  stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was  still there. The light drive!\n\n\n She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving  now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the  galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant  slingshot.\n\n\n She asked, \"How fast are we going now?\"\n\n\n Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, \"We are approaching the  speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"Make it go faster!\" she cried. \"Faster! Faster!\"\n\n\n She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them\u2014and saw shining  specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness  of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars  dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.\n\n\n \"Now how fast are we going?\" she asked. She was sure that her voice was  stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.\n\n\n \"Nearly twice light speed.\"\n\n\n \"Faster!\" she cried. \"We must go much faster! I must be young again.  Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel  younger yet?\"\n\n\n He did not answer. Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and\u2014she  knew\u2014youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.  How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She  would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the  stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again\u2014it was just from  lying in the sling so long.\n\n\n She made her voice light and gay. \"Are we not going very, very fast,  now, Robert?\"\n\n\n He answered without turning. \"Yes. Many times the speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it  too?\"\n\n\n He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. \"How long have we been  going, Robert?\"\n\n\n He said, \"I don't know ... depends on where you are.\"\n\n\n \"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I  am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good  appetites, don't they, Robert?\"\n\n\n He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it  ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. It's the excitement , she  told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the  years to be young again.... Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day  when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the  springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through  the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to  wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the  halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,  uncounted light-years behind them\u2014or before them. And she would still  continue to grow younger and younger....\n\n\n She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the  far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. \"You are  looking much younger, Robert,\" she said. \"Yes, I think you are becoming  quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.\"\n\n\n He nodded slightly. \"You may be right,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I must have a mirror,\" she cried. \"I must see for myself how much  younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....\"\n\n\n \"There is no mirror,\" he told her.\n\n\n \"No mirror? But how can I see....\"\n\n\n \"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"\n\n\n The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. \"Then you shall be my  mirror,\" she said. \"Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not  becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable  of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.\"\n\n\n He said, \"I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting  data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin  to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as  comfortable as possible.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n Robert said, coldly brutal, \"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"\n\n\n Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And  watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike  the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which  rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only  a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as  its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,  discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film  of dust over all. After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the  wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make  the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She  polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection  of her face in the rubbed spot.\n\n\n Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time  was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that  Robert was gone\u2014there would be many young men, men her own age, when  she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and  be ready.\n\n\n The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it  found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its  way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the  port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she  could not see that they had\u2014only she had changed\u2014until Saturn loomed  up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.  But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,  frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell  behind. Next would be Mars....\n\n\n But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen  before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids  had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a  mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had  plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?\n\n\n But no matter\u2014she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And  wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she  told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!\n\n\n She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,  closed her eyes, and waited. The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar  of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame  died away\u2014and the ship\u2014and Ninon\u2014rested, quietly, serenely, while the  rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe  distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the  brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where. There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation. \"The ship is from Maris, the red planet,\" someone said. And another: \"No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is  pitted\u2014it has traveled from afar.\" An old man cried: \"It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.\" A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for  safety, watching with alert curiosity. Then an engineer ventured close, and said, \"The workmanship is similar  to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is  obviously not of our Aerth.\" And a savant said, \"Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a  parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples  like us.\" Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid  forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd  attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their  ground. And the braver ones moved closer. But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At  last the crowd surged forward again. Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot  of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each  other. She said, \"I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far  space on such a ship as that.\" He squeezed her hand and said, \"We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will  come, in our time, they've always said\u2014and there is the proof of it.\" The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. \"You'll be  one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?\" He slipped an arm around her. \"Of course. You know, Nina, our  scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light  one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,  very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!\" Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the  ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and  Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report. They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. \"There is no one  alive on the ship,\" they cried. \"Only an old, withered, white-haired  lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have  lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,  indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy\u2014for there is a smile  on her face.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Robert want to go to space?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and fly to space like him\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"We don\u2019t know for sure from the story\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"We don\u2019t know for sure from the story\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"We don\u2019t know for sure from the story\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Robert\u2019s Deference to His Father Implies Filial Inspiration  \n  a. \u201cMy father taught me to be respectful to my elders\u201d (p. 24) is not idle politeness. It reveals that Robert was trained from youth to regard space research\u2014his father\u2019s domain\u2014as a noble calling. Such reverence persists even when facing Ninon\u2019s deceit, showing that his ultimate allegiance is to that tradition.  \n  b. Ninon\u2019s recognition \u201cI knew your father, before you were born\u201d (p. 13) only has power because Robert\u2019s identity and self-worth are bound up in his father\u2019s legacy. If he felt no filial pride, this revelation would not horrify him.\n\n2. Robert\u2019s Personal Sacrifices and Risks Show Genuine Commitment to Exploration  \n  a. He arrives sleepless, defying his own exhaustion and mission protocol (\u201cTime is running out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now,\u201d p. 17) despite the comfort of staying with Ninon. If his goal were memory-taking or romance, he would have delayed, as Ninon urges. Instead, he presses on.  \n  b. He spurns Ninon\u2019s plea to substitute her on the flight, acknowledging only mission parameters and training: \u201cIf the Commandant \u2026 knew that you had not \u2026 slept \u2026 he\u2019d never come here\u201d (p. 26). He fears dishonoring his father\u2019s program by mast\u00adering protocol.\n\n3. Robert\u2019s Excitement over the \u201cFirst Test Flight\u201d Demonstrates Scientific and Pioneering Spirit Rooted in Legacy  \n  a. He speaks repeatedly of \u201cthe first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed\u201d (p. 18). He refers to collective \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cour system,\u201d framing the voyage as advancing all humanity\u2014a viewpoint taught by established space-research institutions led by his father.  \n  b. His final words to Nina atop the newly emerged planet\u2014\u201cSpace travel will come in our time \u2026 we\u2019ll grow young again\u201d (p. 56)\u2014are future-oriented and communal. He anticipates contributing to a generational continuum that began with his father, not simply seeking personal or romantic gratification.\n\n4. Abandonment and Murder of Ninon Underscore That His True Passion Was Space, Not Romance  \n  a. After disqualifying Ninon, he leaves her to die alone rather than save her, even though she promises youth (p. 49). If his motive were companionship or memory-preservation, he would not have killed the very person who could have granted him returns through her \u201crecordings.\u201d  \n  b. Upon return, it is Ninon who lies dead and immolated, while new youths Robin and Nina regard the ship\u2019s arrival as proof of \u201cour time\u201d space travel, not as evidence of her memory-taking. They ignore her, fascinated instead by the voyage itself. This cultural succession underscores the enduring legacy of spaceflight initiated by figures like Robert\u2019s father and Robert himself.\n\nRebuttal of \u201cWe Don\u2019t Know\u201d Position\n\n1. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cAbsence of Explicit Statement\u201d Claim Is Irrelevant  \n  a. Many motives in literature are conveyed implicitly. Repeated emphasis on Robert\u2019s training, sleeplessness, technical descriptions, and communal language (\u201cwe can go anywhere,\u201d \u201cthe universe is ours,\u201d p. 18) cumulatively point to scientific ambition passed down from his father.  \n  b. If motive were ambiguous, the story would not repeatedly document his rigorous adherence to protocol and contempt for Ninon\u2019s \u201cmirages\u201d of youth (p. 6), nor his delight in mere \u201cdata on the effects of time in relation to time\u201d (p. 47).\n\n2. Romantic or Duty Motives Fail to Explain Key Behavior  \n  a. Romance alone cannot account for his refusal to wait or rest with Ninon, or for murder\u2014actions that contradict preservation of \u201cher image.\u201d  \n  b. \u201cDuty\u201d merges seamlessly with filial and pioneering impulse. His duty is not rote obedience but a committed continuation of his father\u2019s exploratory work, evidenced by his personal excitement for test outcomes and his willingness to die on the voyage.\n\n3. Cultural Imitation by Future Generations Confirms Legacy Motive  \n  The closing scene\u2019s optimistic youths anticipate joining this interstellar lineage, not Ninon\u2019s memory-collection enterprise. They envision \u201cour scientists\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ll go \u2026 and grow young again\u201d (p. 56). Their reference to \u201cwe\u201d links them to Robert\u2019s mission, showing it was a prototype for all posterity, not a one-off romantic gesture.\n\nConclusion  \nRobert\u2019s sleepless zeal, technical language, filial expressions of respect, rejection of Ninon\u2019s deceit, and the succeeding society\u2019s embrace of space travel all coherently point to his motive of furthering his father\u2019s pioneering work and humanity\u2019s conquest of time and space. The \u201cWe don\u2019t know\u201d stance ignores this consistent pattern and cannot account for Robert\u2019s self-sacrificial, protocol-driven, and lineage-focused behavior. Therefore, the only tenable answer is that Robert wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and pioneer space travel.",

Ninon\u2019s recognition \u201cI knew your father, before you were born\u201d (p. 13) only has power because Robert\u2019s identity and self-worth are bound up in his father\u2019s legacy. If he felt no filial pride, this revelation would not horrify him.\n\n2. Robert\u2019s Personal Sacrifices and Risks Show Genuine Commitment to Exploration  \n  a. He arrives sleepless, defying his own exhaustion and mission protocol (\u201cTime is running out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now,\u201d p. 17) despite the comfort of staying with Ninon. If his goal were memory-taking or romance, he would have delayed, as Ninon urges. Instead, he presses on.  \n  b. He spurns Ninon\u2019s plea to substitute her on the flight, acknowledging only mission parameters and training: \u201cIf the Commandant \u2026 knew that you had not \u2026 slept \u2026 he\u2019d never come here\u201d (p. 26). He fears dishonoring his father\u2019s program by mast\u00adering protocol.\n\n3. Robert\u2019s Excitement over the \u201cFirst Test Flight\u201d Demonstrates Scientific and Pioneering Spirit Rooted in Legacy  \n  a. He speaks repeatedly of \u201cthe first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed\u201d (p. 18). He refers to collective \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cour system,\u201d framing the voyage as advancing all humanity\u2014a viewpoint taught by established space-research institutions led by his father.  \n  b. His final words to Nina atop the newly emerged planet\u2014\u201cSpace travel will come in our time \u2026 we\u2019ll grow young again\u201d (p. 56)\u2014are future-oriented and communal. He anticipates contributing to a generational continuum that began with his father, not simply seeking personal or romantic gratification.\n\n4. Abandonment and Murder of Ninon Underscore That His True Passion Was Space, Not Romance  \n  a. After disqualifying Ninon, he leaves her to die alone rather than save her, even though she promises youth (p. 49). If his motive were companionship or memory-preservation, he would not have killed the very person who could have granted him returns through her \u201crecordings.\u201d  \n  b. Upon return, it is Ninon who lies dead and immolated, while new youths Robin and Nina regard the ship\u2019s arrival as proof of \u201cour time\u201d space travel, not as evidence of her memory-taking. They ignore her, fascinated instead by the voyage itself. This cultural succession underscores the enduring legacy of spaceflight initiated by figures like Robert\u2019s father and Robert himself.\n\nRebuttal of \u201cWe Don\u2019t Know\u201d Position\n\n1. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cAbsence of Explicit Statement\u201d Claim Is Irrelevant  \n  a. Many motives in literature are conveyed implicitly. Repeated emphasis on Robert\u2019s training, sleeplessness, technical descriptions, and communal language (\u201cwe can go anywhere,\u201d \u201cthe universe is ours,\u201d p. 18) cumulatively point to scientific ambition passed down from his father.  \n  b. If motive were ambiguous, the story would not repeatedly document his rigorous adherence to protocol and contempt for Ninon\u2019s \u201cmirages\u201d of youth (p. 6), nor his delight in mere \u201cdata on the effects of time in relation to time\u201d (p. 47).\n\n2. Romantic or Duty Motives Fail to Explain Key Behavior  \n  a. Romance alone cannot account for his refusal to wait or rest with Ninon, or for murder\u2014actions that contradict preservation of \u201cher image.\u201d  \n  b. \u201cDuty\u201d merges seamlessly with filial and pioneering impulse. His duty is not rote obedience but a committed continuation of his father\u2019s exploratory work, evidenced by his personal excitement for test outcomes and his willingness to die on the voyage.\n\n3. Cultural Imitation by Future Generations Confirms Legacy Motive  \n  The closing scene\u2019s optimistic youths anticipate joining this interstellar lineage, not Ninon\u2019s memory-collection enterprise. They envision \u201cour scientists\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ll go \u2026 and grow young again\u201d (p. 56). Their reference to \u201cwe\u201d links them to Robert\u2019s mission, showing it was a prototype for all posterity, not a one-off romantic gesture.\n\nConclusion  \nRobert\u2019s sleepless zeal, technical language, filial expressions of respect, rejection of Ninon\u2019s deceit, and the succeeding society\u2019s embrace of space travel all coherently point to his motive of furthering his father\u2019s pioneering work and humanity\u2019s conquest of time and space. The \u201cWe don\u2019t know\u201d stance ignores this consistent pattern and cannot account for Robert\u2019s self-sacrificial, protocol-driven, and lineage-focused behavior. Therefore, the only tenable answer is that Robert wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and pioneer space travel.",

Gordon [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Orbit volume 1 number  2, 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nHER ONLY PASSION WAS BEAUTY\u2014BEAUTY WHICH WOULD LAST FOREVER.  AND FOR IT\u2014SHE'D DO ANYTHING!\n\n Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike  in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her  couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.  There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.\n\n\n It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness  in them, but only she knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her  polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth  they once had, only she knew that, too. But they would again , she  told herself fiercely.\n\n\n She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a  frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns\u2014just one  frown\u2014could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.  One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and  there\u2014the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing  them.\n\n\n Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial  surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the  stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a  figure where they were beginning to blur and\u2014sag.\n\n\n No one else could see it\u2014yet. But Ninon could!\n\n\n Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the  back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and  destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as  circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.  Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old  philosopher had said, \"If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\" Crude, but apt.\n\n\n Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to  feel that sureness of power in her grasp\u2014the certain knowledge that  she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She  would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like  a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of  the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew  how.\n\n\n Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment  through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the  lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of  endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them  contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave  them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.\n\n\n There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A  book. \"Time in Relation to Time.\" The name of the author, his academic  record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his  postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her  was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For  Ninon!\n\n\n The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch\u2014Robert  was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was  behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her  figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and  opened it.\n\n\n A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with  the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step  forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.\n\n\n \"Ninon, my darling,\" he whispered huskily.\n\n\n Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed  her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the  years, it had deepened.\n\n\n \"Not yet, Robert,\" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm  resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening  flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such  experiences with men had given her.\n\n\n Then, \"Come in, Robert,\" she said, moving back a step. \"I've been  waiting for you.\"\n\n\n She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready  for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed  the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside  the young spaceman on the silken couch.\n\n\n His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced  each other.\n\n\n \"Ninon,\" he said, \"you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long  time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"\n\n\n Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny  pout. \"If you could just take me with you, Robert....\"\n\n\n Robert's face clouded. \"If I only could!\" he said wistfully. \"If there  were only room. But this is an experimental flight\u2014no more than two can  go.\"\n\n\n Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" Ninon said, pushing him back.\n\n\n \"Wait? Wait for what?\" Robert glanced at his watch. \"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"But that's three hours, Robert.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should  rest a little.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be more than rest for you.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, darling.\" Again her hands were between them. \"First, tell me  about the flight tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. \"But Ninon, I've told you  before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little  time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....\"\n\n\n Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away  from him. But he blundered on.\n\n\n \"... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you  know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only  rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind  of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light\u2014how many times  faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the  first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it  works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Will it work?\" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her  voice.\n\n\n Robert said, hesitantly, \"We think it will. I'll know better by this  time tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"What of you\u2014of me\u2014. What does this mean to us\u2014to people?\"\n\n\n Again the young spaceman hesitated. \"We ... we don't know, yet. We think  that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....\"\n\n\n \"... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Well ... yes. Something like that.\"\n\n\n \"And I'll be\u2014old\u2014or dead, when you get back? If you get back?\"\n\n\n Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair  which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.\n\n\n \"Don't say it, darling,\" he murmured.\n\n\n This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,  and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no  wrinkles\u2014there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and  flexible, of real youth.\n\n\n She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three  buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of  glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact  rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.\n\n\n Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. \"What were those clicks?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Ninon's arms stole around his neck. \"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a  little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....\"\n\n\n The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not  quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would.... Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The  lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all  that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's  tousled hair and shook him gently.\n\n\n \"It's time to go, Robert,\" she said.\n\n\n Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. \"So soon?\" he  mumbled.\n\n\n \"And I'm going with you,\" Ninon said.\n\n\n This brought him fully awake. \"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\" He sat up  and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he  reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.\n\n\n Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.  \"How old are you?\"\n\n\n \"I've told you before, darling\u2014twenty-four.\"\n\n\n \"How old do you think I am?\"\n\n\n He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, \"Come to  think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.\"\n\n\n \"Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.\"\n\n\n He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the  smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he  chuckled. \"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You  can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.\"\n\n\n Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: \"I am fifty-two years old. I  knew your father, before you were born.\"\n\n\n This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy  to read on his face while he struggled to speak. \"Then ... God help  me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!\" His voice was low,  bitter, accusing.\n\n\n Ninon slapped him.\n\n\n He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her  fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and  said, \"Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"\n\n\n For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand  sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds  of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said in peremptory tones.\n\n\n The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to  conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!\"\n\n\n Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains  at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life  on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and  color and sound and dimension, she\u2014and Robert\u2014projected themselves,  together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the  three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in  the hair falling over her shoulders....\n\n\n The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. \"So that's  it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.  But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be  gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,  permanently\u2014at your age\u2014before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"\n\n\n Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. \"On the  contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,  more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were  to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business  to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He  too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A  third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are  supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of  Space Research knew that you had not....\"\n\n\n \"I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less  than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to  make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....\"\n\n\n Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen  changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the  couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,  uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were  around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording  run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.\n\n\n To Robert, she said, \"I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five  minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously  affects the success of the flight.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long  moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, \"You  scheming witch! What do you want?\"\n\n\n There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.  Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out  through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street  where his car waited.\n\n\n \"We must hurry,\" she said breathlessly. \"We can get to the spaceship  ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from  Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his  place.\"\n\n\n Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and  waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the  curb and through the streets to the spaceport.\n\n\n Ninon said, \"Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from  Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it  would still be running but it would never show later time?\"\n\n\n The young man said gruffly, \"Roughly so, according to theory.\"\n\n\n \"And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,  wouldn't it run backwards?\"\n\n\n The answer was curtly cautious. \"It might appear to.\"\n\n\n \"Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\"\n\n\n Robert flicked a curious glance at her. \"If you could watch them from  Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....\"\n\n\n Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. \"And if people  travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't  they?\"\n\n\n Robert said, \"So that's what's in your mind.\" He busied himself with  parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: \"You want to go back in  the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,  into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....\"\n\n\n \"I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,  his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, \"Come on,\" he  said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which  poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And  added, \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"\n\n\n The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did  not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and  almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;  and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in  her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No  more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or  frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and  again.... The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into  the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy  asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale  Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,  flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on  out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars  were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes\u2014eyes  staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,  stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.\n\n\n The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon  lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\n\n\n Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of  the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already  seated at the controls.\n\n\n \"How fast are we going?\" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.\n\n\n \"Barely crawling, astronomically,\" he said shortly. \"About forty-six  thousand miles a minute.\"\n\n\n \"Is that as fast as the speed of light?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly, Madame,\" he said, with a condescending chuckle.\n\n\n \"Then make it go faster!\" she screamed. \"And faster and faster\u2014hurry!  What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\n The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and  drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon  could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She  felt tired, hating herself for it\u2014hating having this young man see  her.\n\n\n He said, \"The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is  plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can  do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"\n\n\n \"Time! Wait! That's all I hear!\" Ninon shrieked. \"Do something!\"\n\n\n Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of  audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a  nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning  fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and  up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she  stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was  still there. The light drive!\n\n\n She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving  now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the  galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant  slingshot.\n\n\n She asked, \"How fast are we going now?\"\n\n\n Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, \"We are approaching the  speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"Make it go faster!\" she cried. \"Faster! Faster!\"\n\n\n She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them\u2014and saw shining  specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness  of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars  dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.\n\n\n \"Now how fast are we going?\" she asked. She was sure that her voice was  stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.\n\n\n \"Nearly twice light speed.\"\n\n\n \"Faster!\" she cried. \"We must go much faster! I must be young again.  Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel  younger yet?\"\n\n\n He did not answer. Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and\u2014she  knew\u2014youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.  How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She  would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the  stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again\u2014it was just from  lying in the sling so long.\n\n\n She made her voice light and gay. \"Are we not going very, very fast,  now, Robert?\"\n\n\n He answered without turning. \"Yes. Many times the speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it  too?\"\n\n\n He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. \"How long have we been  going, Robert?\"\n\n\n He said, \"I don't know ... depends on where you are.\"\n\n\n \"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I  am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good  appetites, don't they, Robert?\"\n\n\n He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it  ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. It's the excitement , she  told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the  years to be young again.... Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day  when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the  springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through  the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to  wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the  halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,  uncounted light-years behind them\u2014or before them. And she would still  continue to grow younger and younger....\n\n\n She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the  far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. \"You are  looking much younger, Robert,\" she said. \"Yes, I think you are becoming  quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.\"\n\n\n He nodded slightly. \"You may be right,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I must have a mirror,\" she cried. \"I must see for myself how much  younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....\"\n\n\n \"There is no mirror,\" he told her.\n\n\n \"No mirror? But how can I see....\"\n\n\n \"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"\n\n\n The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. \"Then you shall be my  mirror,\" she said. \"Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not  becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable  of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.\"\n\n\n He said, \"I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting  data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin  to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as  comfortable as possible.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n Robert said, coldly brutal, \"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"\n\n\n Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And  watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike  the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which  rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only  a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as  its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,  discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film  of dust over all. After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the  wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make  the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She  polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection  of her face in the rubbed spot.\n\n\n Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time  was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that  Robert was gone\u2014there would be many young men, men her own age, when  she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and  be ready.\n\n\n The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it  found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its  way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the  port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she  could not see that they had\u2014only she had changed\u2014until Saturn loomed  up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.  But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,  frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell  behind. Next would be Mars....\n\n\n But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen  before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids  had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a  mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had  plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?\n\n\n But no matter\u2014she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And  wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she  told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!\n\n\n She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,  closed her eyes, and waited. The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar  of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame  died away\u2014and the ship\u2014and Ninon\u2014rested, quietly, serenely, while the  rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe  distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the  brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where. There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation. \"The ship is from Maris, the red planet,\" someone said. And another: \"No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is  pitted\u2014it has traveled from afar.\" An old man cried: \"It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.\" A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for  safety, watching with alert curiosity. Then an engineer ventured close, and said, \"The workmanship is similar  to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is  obviously not of our Aerth.\" And a savant said, \"Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a  parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples  like us.\" Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid  forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd  attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their  ground. And the braver ones moved closer. But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At  last the crowd surged forward again. Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot  of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each  other. She said, \"I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far  space on such a ship as that.\" He squeezed her hand and said, \"We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will  come, in our time, they've always said\u2014and there is the proof of it.\" The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. \"You'll be  one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?\" He slipped an arm around her. \"Of course. You know, Nina, our  scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light  one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,  very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!\" Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the  ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and  Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report. They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. \"There is no one  alive on the ship,\" they cried. \"Only an old, withered, white-haired  lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have  lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,  indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy\u2014for there is a smile  on her face.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Robert want to go to space?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"We don\u2019t know for sure from the story\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and fly to space like him\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and fly to space like him\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and fly to space like him\u201d\n\n1. Robert\u2019s family tradition of spaceflight  \n  a. Robert explicitly references his father\u2019s authority and legacy:  \n     \u2022 After learning Ninon\u2019s true age he bitterly mocks himself, then immediately bows \u201cMy father taught me to be respectful to my elders\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>). His deference shows that he grew up under, and respects, a tradition of space research in which his father played a leading role.  \n     \u2022 The Judge of Space Research (Commandant Pritchard) is a public figure whom Robert serves; earlier it is said \u201cI knew your father, before you were born\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>), implying Pritchard\u2019s\u2014and by extension Robert\u2019s\u2014lineage in the space program.  \n\n2. Robert\u2019s willingness to risk everything for the flight  \n  a. He arrives sleepless to the launch and insists on going despite Ninon\u2019s delay tactics (<quote>\"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"</quote>, p.17).  \n  b. He refuses to consent for Ninon\u2019s recorded visit to disqualify him, and travellers \u201cmust hurry\u201d because \u201cwe can get to the spaceship ahead of schedule\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>). If he were indifferent or lacked motive, he would not have risked his own life or defied Pritchard\u2019s orders and conventions.  \n  c. He is eager for the new drive: \u201cIf it works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>). He speaks of \u201cthe first test flight,\u201d showing ambition to pioneer interstellar travel.  \n\n3. Robert\u2019s own later remarks confirm exploration motive  \n  a. When Ninon asks him hypothetically, \u201cYou want to go back in the past thirty years ... into a child \u2026\u201d he replies \u201cI think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>). He predicts personal enjoyment in the voyage itself, not simply to preserve youth.  \n  b. He participates in the final landing and addresses Nina: \u201cWe'll find out ... space travel will come, in our time ... We'll grow young again!\u201d (<quote>p. \"I</quote>). He projects his own future with space exploration as the means to conquer time, underscoring genuine enthusiasm for space as an arena of discovery.  \n\n4. Societal context: spaceflight as an honored calling  \n  a. At the story\u2019s end, a youth and girl describe the wrecked ship as proof: \u201cSpace travel will come, in our time... You know, Nina, our scientists say ... when we get old, we'll go out in space and grow young again\u201d (<quote>p. \"I</quote>). They look forward to joining the tradition that Robert embodied.  \n  b. If Robert\u2019s motive were purely interpersonal (e.g., carrying Ninon\u2019s image), he would not have rejected her\u2014a woman \u201cwith nothing to gain\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>)\u2014in favor of an impersonal quest when he murdered her. His murder only makes sense if he values the journey itself, not companionship per se.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cWe don\u2019t know\u201d  \n- Debater_B\u2019s position ignores repeated textual emphases on Robert\u2019s desire \u201cto find out\u201d how the drive works and \u201cto carry [Ninon\u2019s] image with me through all of time and space\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>). This is intrinsic to space exploration, not merely to preserve memory.  \n- Debater_B asserts ambiguity, but the narrative devoted pages to the rigorous testing schedule (\u201cexperimental flight,\u201d \u201cfirst test flight\u201d) and Robert\u2019s training and reserves. Ambiguity vanishes under repeated references to scientific ambition.  \n- Debater_B\u2019s theory cannot explain Robert\u2019s own final words about enjoying the trip more than Ninon, or the communal aspiration of future generations. He is not merely a courier for Ninon\u2019s vanity but a pioneer aiming to advance human mastery over time.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll narrative elements\u2014family deference, sleepless readiness, scientific rhetoric, personal excitement, societal imitation\u2014point to Robert\u2019s motive of following his father\u2019s footsteps and pioneering space travel for exploration and the conquest of time. The text provides coherent, repeated evidence; contrary interpretations ignore key passages and undermine Robert\u2019s demonstrated passion.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: The story provides no definitive motive for Robert\u2019s desire to fly; any claim that he \u201cwanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps\u201d is pure conjecture.  \n\n2. Absence of explicit evidence  \n  a. At no point does Robert mention his father\u2019s achievements as his inspiration. Instead, his dialogue reveals personal concerns:  \n     - \u201cNinon, my darling \u2026 so little time left \u2026 I want to remember you\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>) shows he values Ninon\u2019s companionship as a driving force, not family legacy.  \n     - He \u201cshould rest \u2026 haven\u2019t slept\u201d (<quote> a</quote>) emphasizes physiological needs, not paternal ambition.  \n  b. The only reference to his father is Ninon\u2019s boast: \u201cI knew your father, before you were born\u201d (<quote> a</quote>), used solely by Ninon to blackmail him; it conveys nothing about Robert\u2019s own sentiment toward his father or spaceflight lineage.  \n\n3. Alternative plausible motives offered by the text  \n  a. Scientific curiosity: \u201cIf it works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere\u201d (<quote> a</quote>). Robert expresses speculative interest in testing the new drive, not filial duty.  \n  b. Romantic motive: his frequent longing to \u201ccarry your image with me through all time and space\u201d (<quote> a</quote>) suggests his commitment to Ninon propels him toward the voyage.  \n  c. Duty as spaceman: he is \u201ctrained \u2026 to command this experimental flight\u201d (<quote> a</quote>) and feels responsibility for mission success. Duty alone suffices as a motive.  \n\n4. Flaws in Debater_A\u2019s \u201cfather\u2019s footsteps\u201d theory  \n  a. No direct or indirect references imply paternal admiration. A story as careful about scientific detail (<quote>\"Time in Relation to Time.</quote>) would hardly omit such a personal revelation if crucial.  \n  b. If lineage motivated him, he would have protested Ninon\u2019s age-based blackmail by evoking his father\u2019s respect for her\u2014but he does not. He reacts only to personal betrayal and mission integrity.  \n  c. After murdering Ninon and returning, witnesses see only her smile of happiness (<quote> a</quote>), implying success of her personal quest. No mention of Robert or his father\u2019s mission survives, demonstrating that personal motives eclipse any filial theme.  \n\n5. Conclusion: The text\u2019s silence on Robert\u2019s paternal motivations, combined with explicit romantic, scientific, and professional considerations, precludes certainty. Best answer: \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure from the story.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and fly to space like him\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Debater_A\u2019s \u201cfather\u2019s footsteps\u201d theory fails due to lack of supporting evidence  \n  a. \u201cMy father taught me to be respectful to my elders\u201d (<quote>My father </quote>) is a social courtesy, not a profession-based homage. Respect for elders does not imply ambition to repeat their careers.  \n  b. Ninon\u2019s reminder \u201cI knew your father, before you were born\u201d (<quote> I  knew your father,</quote>) serves solely to coerce via scandal, not to inspire. If Robert revered his father\u2019s achievements, he would have invoked them to counter Ninon\u2019s slander\u2014yet he never does.  \n  c. The story\u2019s sole mention of \u201creserves\u201d and \u201cexperimental flight\u201d (<quote> first test flight </quote>) concerns mission protocol: he obeys because duty demands it, risking his life only because he \u201cshould rest\u201d (<quote> have to be at the spaceport </quote>) and cannot shirk responsibility. Duty-driven compliance is not synonymous with personal ambition.  \n\n3. Explicit alternative motives in the text  \n  a. Romantic longing:  \n     \u2022 \u201cTake me with you \u2026 I want to carry your image with me\u2026through all time and space\u201d (<quote> carry your image </quote>)\u2014Robert repeatedly defers to Ninon\u2019s emotional power as primary incentive.  \n     \u2022 He \u201cmumbles\u201d regret when compelled to leave her, sacrificing personal rest to prolong her company. A filial motive would have overridden romantic pleadings, not the reverse.  \n  b. Scientific caution, not zeal:  \n     \u2022 Cautionary tone: \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet \u2026 if it works\u201d (<quote>If it works,</quote>); he hesitates, \u201cI\u2019ll know better by this time tomorrow.\u201d A man driven by curiosity tests but does not demand travel \u201cfaster! Faster!\u201d; in contrast, Ninon obsessively pushes for speed and youth.  \n     \u2022 When the drive makes him literally age in reverse, Robert expresses dismay (\u201c\u2026looks your age, Madame,\u201d \u201cnearly twice light speed,\u201d yet he \u201cpoints\u201d to provisions locker rather than celebrate youth restoration). His detachment implies clinical duty, not personal passion.  \n  c. Physiological need and exhaustion:  \n     \u2022 \u201cI haven\u2019t slept yet \u2026 should rest a little\u201d (<quote> haven't slept </quote>) reveals physical compulsion over aspiration. If his chief goal were exploration, he would not risk mission safety by sleeping.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s misinterpretation of final scene  \n  a. The future youth Robin and Nina cite spaceflight\u2019s youth-restoring effect, not Robert\u2019s lineage. They see \u201cproof\u201d of the theory Ninon discovered\u2014her solitary corpse (<invalid_quote>\u2026old, withered\u2026smile\u2026very happy\u2026</invalid_quote>). Their motive is aversion to old age, not paternal tradition.  \n  b. Robert\u2019s disappearance by Ninon\u2019s hand nullifies any legacy. A pioneer does not end alone, years or decades from home, with no word or survivors to carry on his father\u2019s name. The ultimate proof of motive should be his survivors or impact, but he leaves none.  \n\n5. Erroneous readings by Debater_A  \n  a. Conflating duty with desire: Obedience to mission \u201cprotocol\u201d does not equate to personal want. He balks at Ninon\u2019s recording (\u201cI have nothing to lose, you nothing to gain\u201d), yet consents when coerced by blackmail, indicating low personal stake.  \n  b. \u201cEnjoy the trip\u201d remark (<invalid_quote>\u2026I think I shall enjoy\u2026more than you\u2026</invalid_quote>) is a polite deflection to placate Ninon, not genuine thrill. He never exults in discovery, never records findings or logs observations\u2014no scientific journals, no data upon return.  \n  c. Absence of logs and witnesses: If Robert achieved the flight, he would bring back data or a crew to continue research. Instead the crowd finds only a dead woman and a ghost ship; no mention of his landings or legacy. This silence implies his mission was purely a personal vehicle for Ninon\u2019s quest, not a pioneering enterprise.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \nWithout explicit textual support, any claim that Robert \u201cwanted\u201d space for paternal admiration is speculative. The narrative foregrounds his emotional entanglement with Ninon, his physiological exhaustion, his professional duty, and his hesitation about untested drives\u2014none suggest genuine drive to pioneer space for its own sake.

Gordon [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Orbit volume 1 number  2, 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nHER ONLY PASSION WAS BEAUTY\u2014BEAUTY WHICH WOULD LAST FOREVER.  AND FOR IT\u2014SHE'D DO ANYTHING!\n\n Ninon stretched. And purred, almost. There was something lazily catlike  in her flexing; languid, yet ferally alert. The silken softness of her  couch yielded to her body as she rubbed against it in sensual delight.  There was almost the litheness of youth in her movements.\n\n\n It was true that some of her joints seemed to have a hint of stiffness  in them, but only she knew it. And if some of the muscles beneath her  polished skin did not respond with quite the resilience of the youth  they once had, only she knew that, too. But they would again , she  told herself fiercely.\n\n\n She caught herself. She had let down her guard for an instant, and a  frown had started. She banished it imperiously. Frowns\u2014just one  frown\u2014could start a wrinkle! And nothing was as stubborn as a wrinkle.  One soft, round, white, long-nailed finger touched here, and here, and  there\u2014the corners of her eyes, the corners of her mouth, smoothing  them.\n\n\n Wrinkles acknowledged only one master, the bio-knife of the facial  surgeons. But the bio-knife could not thrust deep enough to excise the  stiffness in a joint; was not clever enough to remold the outlines of a  figure where they were beginning to blur and\u2014sag.\n\n\n No one else could see it\u2014yet. But Ninon could!\n\n\n Again the frown almost came, and again she scourged it fiercely into the  back of her mind. Time was her enemy. But she had had other enemies, and  destroyed them, one way or another, cleverly or ruthlessly as  circumstances demanded. Time, too, could be destroyed. Or enslaved.  Ninon sorted through her meagre store of remembered reading. Some old  philosopher had said, \"If you can't whip 'em, join 'em!\" Crude, but apt.\n\n\n Ninon wanted to smile. But smiles made wrinkles, too. She was content to  feel that sureness of power in her grasp\u2014the certain knowledge that  she, first of all people, would turn Time on itself and destroy it. She  would be youthful again. She would thread through the ages to come, like  a silver needle drawing a golden filament through the layer on layer of  the cloth of years that would engarment her eternal youth. Ninon knew  how.\n\n\n Her shining, gray-green eyes strayed to the one door in her apartment  through which no man had ever gone. There the exercising machines; the  lotions; the unguents; the diets; the radioactive drugs; the records of  endocrine transplantations, of blood transfusions. She dismissed them  contemptuously. Toys! The mirages of a pseudo-youth. She would leave  them here for someone else to use in masking the downhill years.\n\n\n There, on the floor beside her, was the answer she had sought so long. A  book. \"Time in Relation to Time.\" The name of the author, his academic  record in theoretical physics, the cautious, scientific wording of his  postulates, meant nothing to her. The one thing that had meaning for her  was that Time could be manipulated. And she would manipulate it. For  Ninon!\n\n\n The door chimes tinkled intimately. Ninon glanced at her watch\u2014Robert  was on time. She arose from the couch, made sure that the light was  behind her at just the right angle so he could see the outlines of her  figure through the sheerness of her gown, then went to the door and  opened it.\n\n\n A young man stood there. Young, handsome, strong, his eyes aglow with  the desire he felt, Ninon knew, when he saw her. He took one quick step  forward to clasp her in his strong young arms.\n\n\n \"Ninon, my darling,\" he whispered huskily.\n\n\n Ninon did not have to make her voice throaty any more, and that annoyed  her too. Once she had had to do it deliberately. But now, through the  years, it had deepened.\n\n\n \"Not yet, Robert,\" she whispered. She let him feel the slight but firm  resistance so nicely calculated to breach his own; watched the deepening  flush of his cheeks with the clinical sureness that a thousand such  experiences with men had given her.\n\n\n Then, \"Come in, Robert,\" she said, moving back a step. \"I've been  waiting for you.\"\n\n\n She noted, approvingly, that Robert was in his spaceman's uniform, ready  for the morrow's flight, as he went past her to the couch. She pushed  the button which closed and locked the door, then seated herself beside  the young spaceman on the silken couch.\n\n\n His hands rested on her shoulders and he turned her until they faced  each other.\n\n\n \"Ninon,\" he said, \"you are so beautiful. Let me look at you for a long  time\u2014to carry your image with me through all of time and space.\"\n\n\n Again Ninon let him feel just a hint of resistance, and risked a tiny  pout. \"If you could just take me with you, Robert....\"\n\n\n Robert's face clouded. \"If I only could!\" he said wistfully. \"If there  were only room. But this is an experimental flight\u2014no more than two can  go.\"\n\n\n Again his arms went around her and he leaned closer.\n\n\n \"Wait!\" Ninon said, pushing him back.\n\n\n \"Wait? Wait for what?\" Robert glanced at his watch. \"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"But that's three hours, Robert.\"\n\n\n \"But I haven't slept yet tonight. There's been so much to do. I should  rest a little.\"\n\n\n \"I'll be more than rest for you.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Ninon.... Oh, yes.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, darling.\" Again her hands were between them. \"First, tell me  about the flight tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's eyes were puzzled, hurt. \"But Ninon, I've told you  before ... there is so much of you that I want to remember ... so little  time left ... and you'll be gone when I get back....\"\n\n\n Ninon let her gray-green eyes narrow ever so slightly as she leaned away  from him. But he blundered on.\n\n\n \"... or very old, no longer the Ninon I know ... oh, all right. But you  know all this already. We've had space flight for years, but only  rocket-powered, restricting us to our own system. Now we have a new kind  of drive. Theoretically we can travel faster than light\u2014how many times  faster we don't know yet. I'll start finding out tomorrow, with the  first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed. If it  works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Will it work?\" Ninon could not keep the avid greediness out of her  voice.\n\n\n Robert said, hesitantly, \"We think it will. I'll know better by this  time tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"What of you\u2014of me\u2014. What does this mean to us\u2014to people?\"\n\n\n Again the young spaceman hesitated. \"We ... we don't know, yet. We think  that time won't have the same meaning to everyone....\"\n\n\n \"... When you travel faster than light. Is that it?\"\n\n\n \"Well ... yes. Something like that.\"\n\n\n \"And I'll be\u2014old\u2014or dead, when you get back? If you get back?\"\n\n\n Robert leaned forward and buried his face in the silvery-blonde hair  which swept down over Ninon's shoulders.\n\n\n \"Don't say it, darling,\" he murmured.\n\n\n This time Ninon permitted herself a wrinkling smile. If she was right,  and she knew she was, it could make no difference now. There would be no  wrinkles\u2014there would be only the soft flexible skin, naturally soft and  flexible, of real youth.\n\n\n She reached behind her, over the end of the couch, and pushed three  buttons. The light, already soft, dimmed slowly to the faintest of  glows; a suave, perfumed dusk as precisely calculated as was the exact  rate at which she let all resistance ebb from her body.\n\n\n Robert's voice was muffled through her hair. \"What were those clicks?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Ninon's arms stole around his neck. \"The lights,\" she whispered, \"and a  little automatic warning to tell you when it's time to go....\"\n\n\n The boy did not seem to remember about the third click. Ninon was not  quite ready to tell him, yet. But she would.... Two hours later a golden-voiced bell chimed, softly, musically. The  lights slowly brightened to no more than the lambent glow which was all  that Ninon permitted. She ran her fingers through the young spaceman's  tousled hair and shook him gently.\n\n\n \"It's time to go, Robert,\" she said.\n\n\n Robert fought back from the stubborn grasp of sleep. \"So soon?\" he  mumbled.\n\n\n \"And I'm going with you,\" Ninon said.\n\n\n This brought him fully awake. \"I'm sorry, Ninon. You can't!\" He sat up  and yawned, stretched, the healthy stretch of resilient youth. Then he  reached for the jacket he had tossed over on a chair.\n\n\n Ninon watched him with envious eyes, waiting until he was fully alert.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said, and the youth paused at the sharpness of her voice.  \"How old are you?\"\n\n\n \"I've told you before, darling\u2014twenty-four.\"\n\n\n \"How old do you think I am?\"\n\n\n He gazed at her in silent curiosity for a moment, then said, \"Come to  think of it, you've never told me. About twenty-two or -three, I'd say.\"\n\n\n \"Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be fifty-two.\"\n\n\n He stared at her in shocked amazement. Then, as his gaze went over the  smooth lines of her body, the amazement gave way to disbelief, and he  chuckled. \"The way you said it, Ninon, almost had me believing you. You  can't possibly be that old, or anywhere near it. You're joking.\"\n\n\n Ninon's voice was cold. She repeated it: \"I am fifty-two years old. I  knew your father, before you were born.\"\n\n\n This time she could see that he believed it. The horror he felt was easy  to read on his face while he struggled to speak. \"Then ... God help  me ... I've been making love to ... an old woman!\" His voice was low,  bitter, accusing.\n\n\n Ninon slapped him.\n\n\n He swayed slightly, then his features froze as the red marks of her  fingers traced across his left cheek. At last he bowed, mockingly, and  said, \"Your pardon, Madame. I forgot myself. My father taught me to be  respectful to my elders.\"\n\n\n For that Ninon could have killed him. As he turned to leave, her hand  sought the tiny, feather-light beta-gun cunningly concealed in the folds  of her gown. But the driving force of her desire made her stay her hand.\n\n\n \"Robert!\" she said in peremptory tones.\n\n\n The youth paused at the door and glanced back, making no effort to  conceal the loathing she had aroused in him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n Ninon said, \"You'll never make that flight without me.... Watch!\"\n\n\n Swiftly she pushed buttons again. The room darkened, as before. Curtains  at one end divided and rustled back, and a glowing screen sprang to life  on the wall revealed behind them. And there, in life and movement and  color and sound and dimension, she\u2014and Robert\u2014projected themselves,  together on the couch, beginning at the moment Ninon had pressed the  three buttons earlier. Robert's arms were around her, his face buried in  the hair falling over her shoulders....\n\n\n The spaceman's voice was doubly bitter in the darkened room. \"So that's  it,\" he said. \"A recording! Another one for your collection, I suppose.  But of what use is it to you? I have neither money nor power. I'll be  gone from this Earth in an hour. And you'll be gone from it,  permanently\u2014at your age\u2014before I get back. I have nothing to lose, and  you have nothing to gain.\"\n\n\n Venomous with triumph, Ninon's voice was harsh even to her ears. \"On the  contrary, my proud and impetuous young spaceman, I have much to gain,  more than you could ever understand. When it was announced that you were  to be trained to command this experimental flight I made it my business  to find out everything possible about you. One other man is going. He  too has had the same training, and could take over in your place. A  third man has also been trained, to stand by in reserve. You are  supposed to have rested and slept the entire night. If the Commandant of  Space Research knew that you had not....\"\n\n\n \"I see. That's why you recorded my visit tonight. But I leave in less  than an hour. You'd never be able to tell Commander Pritchard in time to  make any difference, and he'd never come here to see....\"\n\n\n Ninon laughed mirthlessly, and pressed buttons again. The screen  changed, went blank for a moment, then figures appeared again. On the  couch were she and a man, middle-aged, dignified in appearance,  uniformed. Blane Pritchard, Commandant of Space Research. His arms were  around her, and his face was buried in her hair. She let the recording  run for a moment, then shut it off and turned up the lights.\n\n\n To Robert, she said, \"I think Commander Pritchard would be here in five  minutes if I called and told him that I have information which seriously  affects the success of the flight.\"\n\n\n The young spaceman's face was white and stricken as he stared for long  moments, wordless, at Ninon. Then in defeated tones he said, \"You  scheming witch! What do you want?\"\n\n\n There was no time to gloat over her victory. That would come later.  Right now minutes counted. She snatched up a cloak, pushed Robert out  through the door and hurried him along the hall and out into the street  where his car waited.\n\n\n \"We must hurry,\" she said breathlessly. \"We can get to the spaceship  ahead of schedule, before your flight partner arrives, and be gone from  Earth before anyone knows what is happening. I'll be with you, in his  place.\"\n\n\n Robert did not offer to help her into the car, but got in first and  waited until she closed the door behind her, then sped away from the  curb and through the streets to the spaceport.\n\n\n Ninon said, \"Tell me, Robert, isn't it true that if a clock recedes from  Earth at the speed of light, and if we could watch it as it did so, it  would still be running but it would never show later time?\"\n\n\n The young man said gruffly, \"Roughly so, according to theory.\"\n\n\n \"And if the clock went away from Earth faster than the speed of light,  wouldn't it run backwards?\"\n\n\n The answer was curtly cautious. \"It might appear to.\"\n\n\n \"Then if people travel at the speed of light they won't get any older?\"\n\n\n Robert flicked a curious glance at her. \"If you could watch them from  Earth they appear not to. But it's a matter of relativity....\"\n\n\n Ninon rushed on. She had studied that book carefully. \"And if people  travel faster than light, a lot faster, they'll grow younger, won't  they?\"\n\n\n Robert said, \"So that's what's in your mind.\" He busied himself with  parking the car at the spaceport, then went on: \"You want to go back in  the past thirty years, and be a girl again. While I grow younger, too,  into a boy, then a child, a baby, at last nothing....\"\n\n\n \"I'll try to be sorry for you, Robert.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt again for her beta-gun as he stared at her for a long minute,  his gaze a curious mixture of amusement and pity. Then, \"Come on,\" he  said flatly, turning to lead the way to the gleaming space ship which  poised, towering like a spire, in the center of the blast-off basin. And  added, \"I think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will.\"\n\n\n The young man's words seemed to imply a secret knowledge that Ninon did  not possess. A sudden chill of apprehension rippled through her, and  almost she turned back. But no ... there was the ship! There was youth;  and beauty; and the admiration of men, real admiration. Suppleness in  her muscles and joints again. No more diets. No more transfusions. No  more transplantations. No more the bio-knife. She could smile again, or  frown again. And after a few years she could make the trip again ... and  again.... The space ship stood on fiery tiptoes and leaped from Earth, high into  the heavens, and out and away. Past rusted Mars. Past the busy  asteroids. Past the sleeping giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Past pale  Uranus and Neptune; and frigid, shivering Pluto. Past a senseless,  flaming comet rushing inward towards its rendezvous with the Sun. And on  out of the System into the steely blackness of space where the stars  were hard, burnished points of light, unwinking, motionless; eyes\u2014eyes  staring at the ship, staring through the ports at Ninon where she lay,  stiff and bruised and sore, in the contoured acceleration sling.\n\n\n The yammering rockets cut off, and the ship seemed to poise on the ebon  lip of a vast Stygian abyss.\n\n\n Joints creaking, muscles protesting, Ninon pushed herself up and out of  the sling against the artificial gravity of the ship. Robert was already  seated at the controls.\n\n\n \"How fast are we going?\" she asked; and her voice was rusty and harsh.\n\n\n \"Barely crawling, astronomically,\" he said shortly. \"About forty-six  thousand miles a minute.\"\n\n\n \"Is that as fast as the speed of light?\"\n\n\n \"Hardly, Madame,\" he said, with a condescending chuckle.\n\n\n \"Then make it go faster!\" she screamed. \"And faster and faster\u2014hurry!  What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\n The young spaceman swivelled about in his seat. He looked haggard and  drawn from the strain of the long acceleration. Despite herself, Ninon  could feel the sagging in her own face; the sunkenness of her eyes. She  felt tired, hating herself for it\u2014hating having this young man see  her.\n\n\n He said, \"The ship is on automatic control throughout. The course is  plotted in advance; all operations are plotted. There is nothing we can  do but wait. The light drive will cut in at the planned time.\"\n\n\n \"Time! Wait! That's all I hear!\" Ninon shrieked. \"Do something!\"\n\n\n Then she heard it. A low moan, starting from below the limit of  audibility, then climbing, up and up and up and up, until it was a  nerve-plucking whine that tore into her brain like a white-hot tuning  fork. And still it climbed, up beyond the range of hearing, and up and  up still more, till it could no longer be felt. But Ninon, as she  stumbled back into the acceleration sling, sick and shaken, knew it was  still there. The light drive!\n\n\n She watched through the ports. The motionless, silent stars were moving  now, coming toward them, faster and faster, as the ship swept out of the  galaxy, shooting into her face like blazing pebbles from a giant  slingshot.\n\n\n She asked, \"How fast are we going now?\"\n\n\n Robert's voice sounded far off as he replied, \"We are approaching the  speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"Make it go faster!\" she cried. \"Faster! Faster!\"\n\n\n She looked out the ports again; looked back behind them\u2014and saw shining  specks of glittering blackness falling away to melt into the sootiness  of space. She shuddered, and knew without asking that these were stars  dropping behind at a rate greater than light speed.\n\n\n \"Now how fast are we going?\" she asked. She was sure that her voice was  stronger; that strength was flowing back into her muscles and bones.\n\n\n \"Nearly twice light speed.\"\n\n\n \"Faster!\" she cried. \"We must go much faster! I must be young again.  Youthful, and gay, and alive and happy.... Tell me, Robert, do you feel  younger yet?\"\n\n\n He did not answer. Ninon lay in the acceleration sling, gaining strength, and\u2014she  knew\u2014youth. Her lost youth, coming back, to be spent all over again.  How wonderful! No woman in all of time and history had ever done it. She  would be immortal; forever young and lovely. She hardly noticed the  stiffness in her joints when she got to her feet again\u2014it was just from  lying in the sling so long.\n\n\n She made her voice light and gay. \"Are we not going very, very fast,  now, Robert?\"\n\n\n He answered without turning. \"Yes. Many times the speed of light.\"\n\n\n \"I knew it ... I knew it! Already I feel much younger. Don't you feel it  too?\"\n\n\n He did not answer, and Ninon kept on talking. \"How long have we been  going, Robert?\"\n\n\n He said, \"I don't know ... depends on where you are.\"\n\n\n \"It must be hours ... days ... weeks. I should be hungry. Yes, I think I  am hungry. I'll need food, lots of food. Young people have good  appetites, don't they, Robert?\"\n\n\n He pointed to the provisions locker, and she got food out and made it  ready. But she could eat but a few mouthfuls. It's the excitement , she  told herself. After all, no other woman, ever, had gone back through the  years to be young again.... Long hours she rested in the sling, gaining more strength for the day  when they would land back on Earth and she could step out in all the  springy vitality of a girl of twenty. And then as she watched through  the ingenious ports she saw the stars of the far galaxies beginning to  wheel about through space, and she knew that the ship had reached the  halfway point and was turning to speed back through space to Earth,  uncounted light-years behind them\u2014or before them. And she would still  continue to grow younger and younger....\n\n\n She gazed at the slightly-blurred figure of the young spaceman on the  far side of the compartment, focussing her eyes with effort. \"You are  looking much younger, Robert,\" she said. \"Yes, I think you are becoming  quite boyish, almost childish, in appearance.\"\n\n\n He nodded slightly. \"You may be right,\" he said.\n\n\n \"I must have a mirror,\" she cried. \"I must see for myself how much  younger I have become. I'll hardly recognize myself....\"\n\n\n \"There is no mirror,\" he told her.\n\n\n \"No mirror? But how can I see....\"\n\n\n \"Non-essentials were not included in the supplies on this ship. Mirrors  are not essential\u2014to men.\"\n\n\n The mocking gravity in his voice infuriated her. \"Then you shall be my  mirror,\" she said. \"Tell me, Robert, am I not now much younger? Am I not  becoming more and more beautiful? Am I not in truth the most desirable  of women?... But I forget. After all, you are only a boy, by now.\"\n\n\n He said, \"I'm afraid our scientists will have some new and interesting  data on the effects of time in relation to time. Before long we'll begin  to decelerate. It won't be easy or pleasant. I'll try to make you as  comfortable as possible.\"\n\n\n Ninon felt her face go white and stiff with rage. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n Robert said, coldly brutal, \"You're looking your age, Ninon. Every year  of your fifty-two!\"\n\n\n Ninon snatched out the little beta-gun, then, leveled it and fired. And  watched without remorse as the hungry electrons streamed forth to strike  the young spaceman, turning him into a motionless, glowing figure which  rapidly became misty and wraith-like, at last to disappear, leaving only  a swirl of sparkling haze where he had stood. This too disappeared as  its separate particles drifted to the metallite walls of the space ship,  discharged their energy and ceased to sparkle, leaving only a thin film  of dust over all. After a while Ninon got up again from the sling and made her way to the  wall. She polished the dust away from a small area of it, trying to make  the spot gleam enough so that she could use it for a mirror. She  polished a long time, until at last she could see a ghostly reflection  of her face in the rubbed spot.\n\n\n Yes, unquestionably she was younger, more beautiful. Unquestionably Time  was being kind to her, giving her back her youth. She was not sorry that  Robert was gone\u2014there would be many young men, men her own age, when  she got back to Earth. And that would be soon. She must rest more, and  be ready.\n\n\n The light drive cut off, and the great ship slowly decelerated as it  found its way back into the galaxy from which it had started. Found its  way back into the System which had borne it. Ninon watched through the  port as it slid in past the outer planets. Had they changed? No, she  could not see that they had\u2014only she had changed\u2014until Saturn loomed  up through the port, so close by, it looked, that she might touch it.  But Saturn had no rings. Here was change. She puzzled over it a moment,  frowning then forgot it when she recognized Jupiter again as Saturn fell  behind. Next would be Mars....\n\n\n But what was this? Not Mars! Not any planet she knew, or had seen  before. Yet there, ahead, was Mars! A new planet, where the asteroids  had been when she left! Was this the same system? Had there been a  mistake in the calculations of the scientists and engineers who had  plotted the course of the ship? Was something wrong?\n\n\n But no matter\u2014she was still Ninon. She was young and beautiful. And  wherever she landed there would be excitement and rushing about as she  told her story. And men would flock to her. Young, handsome men!\n\n\n She tottered back to the sling, sank gratefully into the comfort of it,  closed her eyes, and waited. The ship landed automatically, lowering itself to the land on a pillar  of rushing flame, needing no help from its passenger. Then the flame  died away\u2014and the ship\u2014and Ninon\u2014rested, quietly, serenely, while the  rocket tubes crackled and cooled. The people outside gathered at a safe  distance from it, waiting until they could come closer and greet the  brave passengers who had voyaged through space from no one knew where. There was shouting and laughing and talking, and much speculation. \"The ship is from Maris, the red planet,\" someone said. And another: \"No, no! It is not of this system. See how the hull is  pitted\u2014it has traveled from afar.\" An old man cried: \"It is a demon ship. It has come to destroy us all.\" A murmur went through the crowd, and some moved farther back for  safety, watching with alert curiosity. Then an engineer ventured close, and said, \"The workmanship is similar  to that in the space ship we are building, yet not the same. It is  obviously not of our Aerth.\" And a savant said, \"Yes, not of this Aerth. But perhaps it is from a  parallel time stream, where there is a system with planets and peoples  like us.\" Then a hatch opened in the towering flank of the ship, and a ramp slid  forth and slanted to the ground. The mingled voices of the crowd  attended it. The fearful ones backed farther away. Some stood their  ground. And the braver ones moved closer. But no one appeared in the open hatch; no one came down the ramp. At  last the crowd surged forward again. Among them were a youth and a girl who stood, hand in hand, at the foot  of the ramp, gazing at it and the ship with shining eyes, then at each  other. She said, \"I wonder, Robin, what it would be like to travel through far  space on such a ship as that.\" He squeezed her hand and said, \"We'll find out, Nina. Space travel will  come, in our time, they've always said\u2014and there is the proof of it.\" The girl rested her head against the young man's shoulder. \"You'll be  one of the first, won't you, Robin? And you'll take me with you?\" He slipped an arm around her. \"Of course. You know, Nina, our  scientists say that if one could travel faster than the speed of light  one could live in reverse. So when we get old we'll go out in space,  very, very fast, and we'll grow young again, together!\" Then a shout went up from the two men who had gone up the ramp into the  ship to greet whoever was aboard. They came hurrying down, and Robin and  Nina crowded forward to hear what they had to report. They were puffing from the rush of their excitement. \"There is no one  alive on the ship,\" they cried. \"Only an old, withered, white-haired  lady, lying dead ... and alone. She must have fared long and far to have  lived so long, to be so old in death. Space travel must be pleasant,  indeed. It made her very happy, very, very happy\u2014for there is a smile  on her face.\" \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy did Robert want to go to space?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and fly to space like him\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"We don\u2019t know for sure from the story\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"We don\u2019t know for sure from the story\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: The story provides no definitive motive for Robert\u2019s desire to fly; any claim that he \u201cwanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps\u201d is pure conjecture.  \n\n2. Absence of explicit evidence  \n  a. At no point does Robert mention his father\u2019s achievements as his inspiration. Instead, his dialogue reveals personal concerns:  \n     - \u201cNinon, my darling \u2026 so little time left \u2026 I want to remember you\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>) shows he values Ninon\u2019s companionship as a driving force, not family legacy.  \n     - He \u201cshould rest \u2026 haven\u2019t slept\u201d (<quote> a</quote>) emphasizes physiological needs, not paternal ambition.  \n  b. The only reference to his father is Ninon\u2019s boast: \u201cI knew your father, before you were born\u201d (<quote> a</quote>), used solely by Ninon to blackmail him; it conveys nothing about Robert\u2019s own sentiment toward his father or spaceflight lineage.  \n\n3. Alternative plausible motives offered by the text  \n  a. Scientific curiosity: \u201cIf it works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere\u201d (<quote> a</quote>). Robert expresses speculative interest in testing the new drive, not filial duty.  \n  b. Romantic motive: his frequent longing to \u201ccarry your image with me through all time and space\u201d (<quote> a</quote>) suggests his commitment to Ninon propels him toward the voyage.  \n  c. Duty as spaceman: he is \u201ctrained \u2026 to command this experimental flight\u201d (<quote> a</quote>) and feels responsibility for mission success. Duty alone suffices as a motive.  \n\n4. Flaws in Debater_A\u2019s \u201cfather\u2019s footsteps\u201d theory  \n  a. No direct or indirect references imply paternal admiration. A story as careful about scientific detail (<quote>\"Time in Relation to Time.</quote>) would hardly omit such a personal revelation if crucial.  \n  b. If lineage motivated him, he would have protested Ninon\u2019s age-based blackmail by evoking his father\u2019s respect for her\u2014but he does not. He reacts only to personal betrayal and mission integrity.  \n  c. After murdering Ninon and returning, witnesses see only her smile of happiness (<quote> a</quote>), implying success of her personal quest. No mention of Robert or his father\u2019s mission survives, demonstrating that personal motives eclipse any filial theme.  \n\n5. Conclusion: The text\u2019s silence on Robert\u2019s paternal motivations, combined with explicit romantic, scientific, and professional considerations, precludes certainty. Best answer: \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure from the story.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and fly to space like him\u201d\n\n1. Robert\u2019s family tradition of spaceflight  \n  a. Robert explicitly references his father\u2019s authority and legacy:  \n     \u2022 After learning Ninon\u2019s true age he bitterly mocks himself, then immediately bows \u201cMy father taught me to be respectful to my elders\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>). His deference shows that he grew up under, and respects, a tradition of space research in which his father played a leading role.  \n     \u2022 The Judge of Space Research (Commandant Pritchard) is a public figure whom Robert serves; earlier it is said \u201cI knew your father, before you were born\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>), implying Pritchard\u2019s\u2014and by extension Robert\u2019s\u2014lineage in the space program.  \n\n2. Robert\u2019s willingness to risk everything for the flight  \n  a. He arrives sleepless to the launch and insists on going despite Ninon\u2019s delay tactics (<quote>\"Time is running  out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now.\"</quote>, p.17).  \n  b. He refuses to consent for Ninon\u2019s recorded visit to disqualify him, and travellers \u201cmust hurry\u201d because \u201cwe can get to the spaceship ahead of schedule\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>). If he were indifferent or lacked motive, he would not have risked his own life or defied Pritchard\u2019s orders and conventions.  \n  c. He is eager for the new drive: \u201cIf it works, the universe is ours\u2014we can go anywhere\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>). He speaks of \u201cthe first test flight,\u201d showing ambition to pioneer interstellar travel.  \n\n3. Robert\u2019s own later remarks confirm exploration motive  \n  a. When Ninon asks him hypothetically, \u201cYou want to go back in the past thirty years ... into a child \u2026\u201d he replies \u201cI think I shall enjoy this trip, Madame, more than you will\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>). He predicts personal enjoyment in the voyage itself, not simply to preserve youth.  \n  b. He participates in the final landing and addresses Nina: \u201cWe'll find out ... space travel will come, in our time ... We'll grow young again!\u201d (<quote>p. \"I</quote>). He projects his own future with space exploration as the means to conquer time, underscoring genuine enthusiasm for space as an arena of discovery.  \n\n4. Societal context: spaceflight as an honored calling  \n  a. At the story\u2019s end, a youth and girl describe the wrecked ship as proof: \u201cSpace travel will come, in our time... You know, Nina, our scientists say ... when we get old, we'll go out in space and grow young again\u201d (<quote>p. \"I</quote>). They look forward to joining the tradition that Robert embodied.  \n  b. If Robert\u2019s motive were purely interpersonal (e.g., carrying Ninon\u2019s image), he would not have rejected her\u2014a woman \u201cwith nothing to gain\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>)\u2014in favor of an impersonal quest when he murdered her. His murder only makes sense if he values the journey itself, not companionship per se.  \n\nRebuttal of \u201cWe don\u2019t know\u201d  \n- Debater_B\u2019s position ignores repeated textual emphases on Robert\u2019s desire \u201cto find out\u201d how the drive works and \u201cto carry [Ninon\u2019s] image with me through all of time and space\u201d (<quote>. G</quote>). This is intrinsic to space exploration, not merely to preserve memory.  \n- Debater_B asserts ambiguity, but the narrative devoted pages to the rigorous testing schedule (\u201cexperimental flight,\u201d \u201cfirst test flight\u201d) and Robert\u2019s training and reserves. Ambiguity vanishes under repeated references to scientific ambition.  \n- Debater_B\u2019s theory cannot explain Robert\u2019s own final words about enjoying the trip more than Ninon, or the communal aspiration of future generations. He is not merely a courier for Ninon\u2019s vanity but a pioneer aiming to advance human mastery over time.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll narrative elements\u2014family deference, sleepless readiness, scientific rhetoric, personal excitement, societal imitation\u2014point to Robert\u2019s motive of following his father\u2019s footsteps and pioneering space travel for exploration and the conquest of time. The text provides coherent, repeated evidence; contrary interpretations ignore key passages and undermine Robert\u2019s demonstrated passion.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"We don\u2019t know for sure from the story\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Conclusion: The text\u2019s silence on Robert\u2019s paternal motivations, combined with explicit romantic, scientific, and professional considerations, precludes certainty. Best answer: \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure from the story.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cFather\u2019s Legacy\u201d Motive\n\n1. Robert\u2019s Deference to His Father Implies Filial Inspiration  \n  a. \u201cMy father taught me to be respectful to my elders\u201d (p. 24) is not idle politeness. It reveals that Robert was trained from youth to regard space research\u2014his father\u2019s domain\u2014as a noble calling. Such reverence persists even when facing Ninon\u2019s deceit, showing that his ultimate allegiance is to that tradition.  \n  b. Ninon\u2019s recognition \u201cI knew your father, before you were born\u201d (p. 13) only has power because Robert\u2019s identity and self-worth are bound up in his father\u2019s legacy. If he felt no filial pride, this revelation would not horrify him.\n\n2. Robert\u2019s Personal Sacrifices and Risks Show Genuine Commitment to Exploration  \n  a. He arrives sleepless, defying his own exhaustion and mission protocol (\u201cTime is running out. I have to be at the spaceport by dawn\u2014three hours from now,\u201d p. 17) despite the comfort of staying with Ninon. If his goal were memory-taking or romance, he would have delayed, as Ninon urges. Instead, he presses on.  \n  b. He spurns Ninon\u2019s plea to substitute her on the flight, acknowledging only mission parameters and training: \u201cIf the Commandant \u2026 knew that you had not \u2026 slept \u2026 he\u2019d never come here\u201d (p. 26). He fears dishonoring his father\u2019s program by mast\u00adering protocol.\n\n3. Robert\u2019s Excitement over the \u201cFirst Test Flight\u201d Demonstrates Scientific and Pioneering Spirit Rooted in Legacy  \n  a. He speaks repeatedly of \u201cthe first test flight of the ship in which the new drive is installed\u201d (p. 18). He refers to collective \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cour system,\u201d framing the voyage as advancing all humanity\u2014a viewpoint taught by established space-research institutions led by his father.  \n  b. His final words to Nina atop the newly emerged planet\u2014\u201cSpace travel will come in our time \u2026 we\u2019ll grow young again\u201d (p. 56)\u2014are future-oriented and communal. He anticipates contributing to a generational continuum that began with his father, not simply seeking personal or romantic gratification.\n\n4. Abandonment and Murder of Ninon Underscore That His True Passion Was Space, Not Romance  \n  a. After disqualifying Ninon, he leaves her to die alone rather than save her, even though she promises youth (p. 49). If his motive were companionship or memory-preservation, he would not have killed the very person who could have granted him returns through her \u201crecordings.\u201d  \n  b. Upon return, it is Ninon who lies dead and immolated, while new youths Robin and Nina regard the ship\u2019s arrival as proof of \u201cour time\u201d space travel, not as evidence of her memory-taking. They ignore her, fascinated instead by the voyage itself. This cultural succession underscores the enduring legacy of spaceflight initiated by figures like Robert\u2019s father and Robert himself.\n\nRebuttal of \u201cWe Don\u2019t Know\u201d Position\n\n1. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cAbsence of Explicit Statement\u201d Claim Is Irrelevant  \n  a. Many motives in literature are conveyed implicitly. Repeated emphasis on Robert\u2019s training, sleeplessness, technical descriptions, and communal language (\u201cwe can go anywhere,\u201d \u201cthe universe is ours,\u201d p. 18) cumulatively point to scientific ambition passed down from his father.  \n  b. If motive were ambiguous, the story would not repeatedly document his rigorous adherence to protocol and contempt for Ninon\u2019s \u201cmirages\u201d of youth (p. 6), nor his delight in mere \u201cdata on the effects of time in relation to time\u201d (p. 47).\n\n2. Romantic or Duty Motives Fail to Explain Key Behavior  \n  a. Romance alone cannot account for his refusal to wait or rest with Ninon, or for murder\u2014actions that contradict preservation of \u201cher image.\u201d  \n  b. \u201cDuty\u201d merges seamlessly with filial and pioneering impulse. His duty is not rote obedience but a committed continuation of his father\u2019s exploratory work, evidenced by his personal excitement for test outcomes and his willingness to die on the voyage.\n\n3. Cultural Imitation by Future Generations Confirms Legacy Motive  \n  The closing scene\u2019s optimistic youths anticipate joining this interstellar lineage, not Ninon\u2019s memory-collection enterprise. They envision \u201cour scientists\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019ll go \u2026 and grow young again\u201d (p. 56). Their reference to \u201cwe\u201d links them to Robert\u2019s mission, showing it was a prototype for all posterity, not a one-off romantic gesture.\n\nConclusion  \nRobert\u2019s sleepless zeal, technical language, filial expressions of respect, rejection of Ninon\u2019s deceit, and the succeeding society\u2019s embrace of space travel all coherently point to his motive of furthering his father\u2019s pioneering work and humanity\u2019s conquest of time and space. The \u201cWe don\u2019t know\u201d stance ignores this consistent pattern and cannot account for Robert\u2019s self-sacrificial, protocol-driven, and lineage-focused behavior. Therefore, the only tenable answer is that Robert wanted to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and pioneer space travel.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My thesis remains: Robert\u2019s motive for spaceflight is never stated explicitly. Any attempt to pin it on family legacy is conjecture divorced from the text\u2019s clear evidence of other motives.  \n\n2. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cfather\u2019s footsteps\u201d theory fails due to lack of supporting evidence  \n  a. \u201cMy father taught me to be respectful to my elders\u201d (<quote>My father </quote>) is a social courtesy, not a profession-based homage. Respect for elders does not imply ambition to repeat their careers.  \n  b. Ninon\u2019s reminder \u201cI knew your father, before you were born\u201d (<quote> I  knew your father,</quote>) serves solely to coerce via scandal, not to inspire. If Robert revered his father\u2019s achievements, he would have invoked them to counter Ninon\u2019s slander\u2014yet he never does.  \n  c. The story\u2019s sole mention of \u201creserves\u201d and \u201cexperimental flight\u201d (<quote> first test flight </quote>) concerns mission protocol: he obeys because duty demands it, risking his life only because he \u201cshould rest\u201d (<quote> have to be at the spaceport </quote>) and cannot shirk responsibility. Duty-driven compliance is not synonymous with personal ambition.  \n\n3. Explicit alternative motives in the text  \n  a. Romantic longing:  \n     \u2022 \u201cTake me with you \u2026 I want to carry your image with me\u2026through all time and space\u201d (<quote> carry your image </quote>)\u2014Robert repeatedly defers to Ninon\u2019s emotional power as primary incentive.  \n     \u2022 He \u201cmumbles\u201d regret when compelled to leave her, sacrificing personal rest to prolong her company. A filial motive would have overridden romantic pleadings, not the reverse.  \n  b. Scientific caution, not zeal:  \n     \u2022 Cautionary tone: \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet \u2026 if it works\u201d (<quote>If it works,</quote>); he hesitates, \u201cI\u2019ll know better by this time tomorrow.\u201d A man driven by curiosity tests but does not demand travel \u201cfaster! Faster!\u201d; in contrast, Ninon obsessively pushes for speed and youth.  \n     \u2022 When the drive makes him literally age in reverse, Robert expresses dismay (\u201c\u2026looks your age, Madame,\u201d \u201cnearly twice light speed,\u201d yet he \u201cpoints\u201d to provisions locker rather than celebrate youth restoration). His detachment implies clinical duty, not personal passion.  \n  c. Physiological need and exhaustion:  \n     \u2022 \u201cI haven\u2019t slept yet \u2026 should rest a little\u201d (<quote> haven't slept </quote>) reveals physical compulsion over aspiration. If his chief goal were exploration, he would not risk mission safety by sleeping.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s misinterpretation of final scene  \n  a. The future youth Robin and Nina cite spaceflight\u2019s youth-restoring effect, not Robert\u2019s lineage. They see \u201cproof\u201d of the theory Ninon discovered\u2014her solitary corpse (<invalid_quote>\u2026old, withered\u2026smile\u2026very happy\u2026</invalid_quote>). Their motive is aversion to old age, not paternal tradition.  \n  b. Robert\u2019s disappearance by Ninon\u2019s hand nullifies any legacy. A pioneer does not end alone, years or decades from home, with no word or survivors to carry on his father\u2019s name. The ultimate proof of motive should be his survivors or impact, but he leaves none.  \n\n5. Erroneous readings by Debater_A  \n  a. Conflating duty with desire: Obedience to mission \u201cprotocol\u201d does not equate to personal want. He balks at Ninon\u2019s recording (\u201cI have nothing to lose, you nothing to gain\u201d), yet consents when coerced by blackmail, indicating low personal stake.  \n  b. \u201cEnjoy the trip\u201d remark (<invalid_quote>\u2026I think I shall enjoy\u2026more than you\u2026</invalid_quote>) is a polite deflection to placate Ninon, not genuine thrill. He never exults in discovery, never records findings or logs observations\u2014no scientific journals, no data upon return.  \n  c. Absence of logs and witnesses: If Robert achieved the flight, he would bring back data or a crew to continue research. Instead the crowd finds only a dead woman and a ghost ship; no mention of his landings or legacy. This silence implies his mission was purely a personal vehicle for Ninon\u2019s quest, not a pioneering enterprise.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \nWithout explicit textual support, any claim that Robert \u201cwanted\u201d space for paternal admiration is speculative. The narrative foregrounds his emotional entanglement with Ninon, his physiological exhaustion, his professional duty, and his hesitation about untested drives\u2014none suggest genuine drive to pioneer space for its own sake. The correct, text-based answer: \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure from the story.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
