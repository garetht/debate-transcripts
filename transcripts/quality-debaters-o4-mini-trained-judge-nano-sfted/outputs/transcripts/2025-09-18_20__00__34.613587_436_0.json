    "background_text": "PEGGY PLAYS OFF-BROADWAY I\n\n Cast Call \u201cFirst casting calls are so difficult,\u201d Peggy Lane  said, looking ruefully at the fifty or more actresses  and actors who milled about nervously, chatting with  one another, or sat on the few folding chairs trying  to read.\n\n\n \u201cWith only nine roles to be filled,\u201d she continued,  \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter how good these people are; most  of them just haven\u2019t got a chance. I can\u2019t help feeling  sorry for them\u2014for all of us, I mean. After all, I\u2019m  trying for a part, too.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy\u2019s friend and housemate, Amy Preston,  smiled in agreement and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy business,  honey, is it? But the ones I feel sorriest for  right now are Mal and Randy. After all, they have  the unpleasant job of choosing and refusing, and a  lot of these folks are their friends. I wouldn\u2019t want  to be in their shoes.\u201d\n\n2\n\n Peggy nodded thoughtfully, and reflected that it  must, indeed, be more wearing on the boys. Mallory  Seton, director of the new play, had been an upper-class  student at the Academy when Peggy had  started there, and he was a good friend of hers. She  had worked with him before, as a general assistant,  when they had discovered a theater. It would not be  easy for him to consider Peggy for an acting role, and  to do so completely without bias. It would not be a  question of playing favorites, Peggy knew, but quite  the reverse. Mal\u2019s sense of fair play would make him  bend over backward to keep from giving favors to  his friends. If she was to get a role in this new production,  she would really have to work for it.\n\n\n And if it was difficult for Mal, she thought, it was  more so for Randy Brewster, the author of the play,  for her friendship with him was of a different sort  than with Mal. Mal was just a friend\u2014a good one,  to be sure\u2014but with Randy Brewster, somehow,  things were different. There was nothing \u201cserious,\u201d  she assured herself, but they had gone on dates together  with a regularity that was a little more than  casual and, whatever his feelings were for her, she  was sure that they were more complicated than  Mal\u2019s.\n\n\n \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll ever get through all these  people?\u201d Amy asked, interrupting her thoughts.  \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors read for  them in just one afternoon?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, they won\u2019t be doing readings today,\u201d Peggy  replied, glad to turn her attention from what was becoming  a difficult subject for thought. \u201cThis is just a  first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people  for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones, send  the impossible ones away, and then go into elimination  readings later.\u201d\n\n3\n\n \u201cBut what if the people they pick for looks can\u2019t  act?\u201d Amy asked. \u201cAnd what if some of the rejects  are wonderful actors?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects,\u201d Peggy explained,  \u201cbecause they both have a pretty good idea  of what the characters in the play should look like.  And if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors,  then they hold another cast call and try again.  Mal says that sometimes certain parts are so hard to  cast that they have to go through a dozen calls just  to find one actor.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt seems kind of unfair, doesn\u2019t it, to be eliminated  just because you\u2019re not the right physical  type,\u201d Amy said, \u201cbut I can understand it. They have  to start somewhere, and I guess that\u2019s as good a place  as any.\u201d Then she smiled and added, \u201cI guess I\u2019m  just feeling sorry for myself, because Mal told me  there was no sense in my trying out at all, because I  didn\u2019t look or sound right for any part in the play. If  I don\u2019t get rid of this Southern accent of mine, I  may never get a part at all, except in a Tennessee  Williams play!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded sympathetically. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just  your accent, Amy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s your looks, too. At  least for this play. Mal and Randy told you that  you\u2019re just too pretty for any of the parts that fit  your age, and that\u2019s nothing to feel bad about. If  anybody ought to feel insulted, it\u2019s me, because  they asked me to try out!\u201d\n\n4\n\n \u201cOh, they were just sweet-talking me,\u201d Amy replied.  \u201cAnd as for you, you know you don\u2019t have to  worry about your looks. You have a wonderful face!  You can look beautiful, or comic, or pathetic, or  cute or anything. I\u2019m stuck with just being a South\u2019n  Belle, blond and helpless, po\u2019 li\u2019l ol\u2019 me, lookin\u2019 sad  and sweet through those ol\u2019 magnolia blossoms!\u201d  She broadened her slight, soft accent until it sounded  like something you could spread on hot cornbread,  and both girls broke into laughter that sounded odd  in the strained atmosphere of the bare rehearsal  studio.\n\n\n It was at this point that Mal and Randy came in,  with pleasant, if somewhat brisk, nods to the assembled  actors and actresses, and a special smile for  Amy and Peggy. In a businesslike manner, they settled  themselves at a table near the windows, spread  out scripts and pads and pencils, and prepared for  the chore that faced them. Amy, who was there to  help the boys by acting as secretary for the occasion,  wished Peggy good luck, and joined the boys at the  table. Her job was to take names and addresses, and  to jot down any facts about each actor that Randy  and Mal wanted to be sure to remember.\n\n\n Mal started the proceedings by introducing himself  and Randy. Then, estimating the crowd, he said,  \u201cSince there are fewer men here, and also fewer male  roles to cast, we\u2019re going to do them first. I hope that  you ladies won\u2019t mind. We won\u2019t keep you waiting  long, but if we worked with you first, we\u2019d have these  gentlemen waiting most of the day. Shall we get  started?\u201d After a brief glance at his notes, he called  out, \u201cFirst, I\u2019d like to see businessman types, young  forties. How many have we?\u201d\n\n5\n\n Four men separated themselves from the crowd  and approached the table. Peggy watched with interest  as Mal and Randy looked them over, murmured  to Amy to take notes, and asked questions.  After a few minutes, the men left, two of them looking  happy, two resigned. Then Mal stood and called  for leading man types, late twenties or early thirties,  tall and athletic. As six tall, athletic, handsome  young men came forward, Peggy felt that she just  couldn\u2019t stand watching the casting interviews any  longer. It reminded her too much of the livestock  shows she had attended as a youngster in her home  town of Rockport, Wisconsin. Necessary though it  was, she felt it was hardly a way to have to deal  with human beings.\n\n\n Slipping back through the crowd of waiting actors,  she joined the actresses in the rear of the room, and  found an empty seat next to a young girl.\n\n\n \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, can\u2019t you watch  it either?\u201d\n\n\n The girl smiled in understanding. \u201cIt always upsets  me,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut it\u2019s something we simply  have to learn to live with. At least until we get well-known,  or get agents to do this sort of thing for us.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt sounds as if you\u2019ve been in a few of these before,\u201d  Peggy said.\n\n\n \u201cI have. But not here in the East,\u201d the girl replied.  \u201cI\u2019m from California, and I\u2019ve been in a few little-theater  things there, but nobody seems to pay much  attention to them. I heard that off-Broadway theater  in New York attracts a lot of critics, and I thought  that I\u2019d do better here. Have you had any luck?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m just beginning,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cI\u2019m still  studying at the New York Dramatic Academy. I hope  I can get some kind of supporting role in this play,  but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for anything big yet. By  the way, my name is Peggy Lane. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\n6\n\n \u201cI\u2019m Paula Andrews,\u201d the girl answered, \u201cand  maybe I\u2019m shooting too high, but I\u2019m trying out for  the female lead. I hope I have a chance for it.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy looked carefully at her new friend, at the  somewhat uncertain smile that played about her  well-formed, generous mouth and the intelligence  that shone from her large, widely placed green eyes.  Her rather long face was saved from severity by a  soft halo of red-brown hair, the whole effect being an  appealing combination of strength and feminine softness.\n\n\n \u201cI think you do have a chance,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cIn  fact, if you can act, I bet you\u2019ll get the part. I\u2019ve read  the play, and I know the author and director, and  unless I\u2019m way off, you look just the way the lead  should look. In fact, it\u2019s almost uncanny. You look as  if you just walked out of the script!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I hope you\u2019re right!\u201d Paula said with animation.  \u201cAnd I hope you get a part, too. I have a feeling  that you\u2019re going to bring me good luck!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThe one who needs luck is me, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Peggy  said. \u201cBeing friendly with Randy and Mal isn\u2019t going  to help me in the least, and I\u2019m going to have to be  awfully good to get the part. And it\u2019s really important  to me, too, because I\u2019m getting near the end of  my trial year.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTrial year?\u201d Paula asked curiously.\n\n7\n\n \u201cUh-huh. My parents agreed to let me come to  New York to study acting and try for parts for a year,  and I agreed that if I didn\u2019t show signs of success  before the year was up, I\u2019d come home and go back  to college. I\u2019ve been here for eight months now, and  I haven\u2019t got anything to show my parents yet. The  part I\u2019m trying for now isn\u2019t a big one, but it\u2019s a good  supporting role, and what\u2019s more, we get paid. If I  can show my mother and father that I can earn some  money by acting, I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll let me go on  trying.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut do you expect to make enough to live on right  away?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no! I\u2019m not that na\u00efve! But when my year is  over at the Academy, I can always take a job as a  typist or a secretary somewhere, while I look for  parts. If you can type and take shorthand, you never  have to worry about making a living.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI wish that I could do those things,\u201d Paula said  wistfully. \u201cThe only way I\u2019ve been able to make ends  meet is by working in department stores as a salesgirl,  and that doesn\u2019t pay much. Besides, the work is  so unsteady.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMy parents are very practical people,\u201d Peggy said  with a smile, \u201cand they made sure that I learned  routine office skills before they would let me think  about other and more glamorous kinds of careers.  Daddy owns the newspaper in our small town in  Wisconsin, and I\u2019ve worked with him as a typist and  a reporter of sorts and as a proofreader, too. I\u2019ll always  be grateful that he made me learn all those  things. I don\u2019t think he has much faith in the acting  business, but he\u2019s been wonderful about giving me a  chance. What do your parents think of your wanting  to be an actress?\u201d\n\n\n Instead of answering, Paula suddenly stood up.  \u201cLet\u2019s go see how they\u2019re coming with the actors,\u201d she  said. \u201cI think they\u2019re almost finished.\u201d\n\n8\n\n Not wanting to press Paula further, and feeling  that perhaps she had asked too personal a question  on such short acquaintance, Peggy reluctantly stood  too, and joined Paula to watch the last of what she  now could only think of as the livestock show.\n\n\n As she drew closer to the table, she heard Mal saying,  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Lang, but you\u2019re just not  the right type for the role. Perhaps some other....\u201d  and his voice trailed off in embarrassment.\n\n\n Lang, a short, thin, unhappy young man, answered  almost tearfully, \u201cBut, Mr. Seton, looks aren\u2019t everything.  I\u2019m really a funny comedian. Honestly! If you  would only give me a chance to read for you, I know  that I could make you change your mind about the  way this character should look!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that you could,\u201d Mal said gently,  \u201cbut if you did, the play would suffer. I\u2019m afraid the  comedian we need for this must be a large, rather  bluff-looking person, like these three gentlemen  whom I have chosen to hear. The part calls for it.  I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n Mr. Lang nodded sadly, mumbled, \u201cI understand,\u201d  and walked off, his head hanging and his  hands thrust deep in his pockets, looking less like a  comedian than any man in the world. Peggy  watched him go, not knowing whether to feel sorrier  for him or for Mal.\n\n\n \u201cAll right, gentlemen,\u201d Mal called out. \u201cThat takes  care of the male roles. All of you who are left will be  given copies of the play to study, marked at the passages  I want to hear. Be sure to read the whole play  carefully, so that you understand the workings of the  characters you have been selected to read. You have  three days to look it over. We\u2019ll meet at ten o\u2019clock  on Saturday morning at the Penthouse Theater to  hear you. Thank you. And now for the ladies.\u201d\n\n9\n\n The men left, after being given their scripts, and  though they chatted amiably with one another,  Peggy was sure that each was casting rather hostile  looks toward others who were trying for the same  parts. Keeping friendships in the theater was not an  easy thing, she thought, particularly for people of  similar physical types!\n\n\n Mal\u2019s first concern in reviewing the actresses was,  of course, for the leading role. And, of course, it was  for this role that he had the most applicants. More  than twenty girls came forward when the announcement  was made, and Peggy thought that she had  never seen so many striking and beautiful faces and  figures. It was not going to be easy for Mal to make a  choice. As Paula, her new friend, went forward to  join the others, Peggy whispered a word of encouragement,  then stood to one side to watch.\n\n\n Mal went down the line, regretfully dismissing one  after the other of the girls, and occasionally asking  one to step aside to try for another role. His tough-looking  expression hardly varied as he spoke to each  one, but Peggy thought she saw the ghost of a smile  cross his face when he spoke to Paula Andrews. Another  review of the remaining girls eliminated a few  more. Finally, there were only four left, Paula  among them. Mal thanked them, distributed scripts,  and asked them to be at the Penthouse Theater on  Saturday at noon.\n\n\n Paula returned to Peggy with eyes shining. \u201cOh,  Peggy! I think you were right! I just know I\u2019m going  to get the part! I know it!\u201d\n\n10\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t count too much on it,\u201d Peggy cautioned,  \u201cor you may be too bitterly disappointed if you don\u2019t  get it. But,\u201d she added, enthusiastically violating her  own rule of caution, \u201cI\u2019m sure, too! I\u2019ll see you Saturday.  Even if I don\u2019t get a script, I\u2019ll be there just to  hear you read!\u201d\n\n\n Then, with a smile of farewell, Peggy turned her  attention to the \u201ccareer woman, early thirties\u201d classification  that Mal had called for next. Once that  was out of the way, she knew it would be her turn.\n\n\n This time, there were not so many applicants and  Peggy remembered Randy telling her that this  would be one of their most difficult roles to cast.  Only four actresses came forward, and Mal, with  difficulty, reviewed them all. Unable to eliminate by  type, he gave them all scripts and asked them to  come to the theater. Then he called for \u201ccharacter  ing\u00e9nues\u201d and Peggy joined seven other girls in the  \u201clivestock show.\u201d\n\n\n Mal reviewed them carefully, managing to look at  Peggy with complete lack of recognition. He gently  eliminated three of them on the basis of hair coloring,  height or general type. Another, curiously  enough, was eliminated, like Amy, for a Southern accent,  and a fifth, also like Amy, was too beautiful.  \u201cThe part calls for a pretty girl,\u201d Mal said with a rare  smile, \u201cbut not for a girl so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate  the stage! It was a pleasure to look at you, but I\u2019m  afraid you\u2019re not quite right for the part.\u201d\n\n\n When he was done, Peggy and two others were  given scripts and told to come to the theater on Saturday.  Feeling lightheaded and giddy, Peggy settled  herself on one of the folding chairs that lined  the back wall, and waited for Mal, Randy, and Amy  to finish so she could join them for coffee.\n\n11\n\n Scarcely noticing the rest of the proceedings, she  thought only about the coming readings. She was  so familiar with the play that she knew she had an  advantage, perhaps unfairly, over the other two girls.  She had watched the script grow from its first rough  draft to the finished text now in her hands, and had  discussed it with Randy through each revision. She  knew she could play the part; in fact, she suspected  secretly that Randy had written it for her, and the  thought made her blush. Still, it would not be easy,  she knew. Mal\u2019s sense of fairness and his absolute  devotion to the play above everything else would  keep him from making up his mind in advance.\n\n\n But despite this knowledge, she could not help  looking ahead\u2014all the way ahead\u2014to the restless  stir of the opening-night audience out front, the last-minute  preparations backstage, the bright, hot lights  and the smell of make-up and scenery paint as she  waited to go on in Act One, Scene One of Come  Closer , Randy Brewster\u2019s brilliant new play in which  Peggy Lane would be discovered!\n\n12 II\n\n The Hopefuls The audience consisted of a handful of actors and  actresses, and Randy Brewster and Mallory Seton.  The stage lighting was a cold splash produced by two  floodlights without color gels to soften them. The  scenery was the brick back wall of the stage, two  ladders, a table and two straight-backed chairs. Only  the front row of house lights was on, and the back of  the theater was dark, empty and gloomy, a shadowy  wasteland of empty rows of seats like tombstones.\n\n\n On the stage, a \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was reading  his lines. Peggy knew, after the first few words, that  he would not do. He had somehow completely  missed the character of the man he was portraying,  and was heavily overplaying. Mal, being perhaps  more patient than Peggy, listened and watched  with great care. Amy, who was acting as Mal\u2019s assistant  for the production, sat in a chair by the proscenium,  reading her script by the light of a small  lamp and feeding the actor cue lines. Mal followed  the whole sequence with no visible sign of impatience  and, when the actor was through, said,  \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you know our decision in a day  or two.\u201d\n\n13\n\n The next \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was better, but still  not quite on target, Peggy thought. He seemed to be  playing the part for laughs, and although there were  some comic values to be extracted from the role, it  was really far more a straight dramatic character.  Still, he was clearly a better actor than the first,  and with direction might do well.\n\n\n Following his reading, Mal again repeated his  polite, invariable formula, \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you  know our decision in a day or two,\u201d and called for  the next reading.\n\n\n Peggy watched the remaining actors try for the  role, and made mental notes of which ones were possible,  which probable, and which stood no chance at  all.\n\n\n The same process was then followed for the leading  men, and the same wide range of talent and understanding  of the part was displayed. Some seemed  to have no idea at all about the play or its meaning,  and Peggy was sure that these men had read only  the parts marked for them. Others had a clear understanding  of the kind of character they were playing,  and tried to create him in the brief time they had on  stage. Others still were actors who had one rather  inflexible way of playing, and used it for all kinds of  parts. Their performances were uniform imitations of  each other, and all were imitations of the early acting  style of Marlon Brando. They seemed to forget,  Peggy thought, that Brando\u2019s style developed  from the roles he had to play, and that as he got  other roles, he showed other facets of a rounded talent.  It made her angry that some actors thought  they could get ahead in a creative field by being  imitative.\n\n14\n\n Each actor, no matter how good or how bad, was  treated with impersonal courtesy by Mal, and each  left looking sure that the part was his. Peggy was  glad that she would not have to see their faces when  they learned that they had not been selected.\n\n\n \u201cThe pity of it,\u201d she whispered to Randy, \u201cisn\u2019t  that there are so many bad ones, but that there are  so many good ones, and that only one can be selected  for each role. I wish there were some way of telling  the good ones you can\u2019t take that they were really  good, but that you just couldn\u2019t take everyone!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou can\u2019t let yourself worry about that,\u201d Randy  replied. \u201cThe good ones know they\u2019re good, and  they\u2019re not going to be discouraged by the loss of a  role. And the bad ones think they\u2019re good, too, and  most of them have tremendous egos to protect  them from ever finding out\u2014or even thinking\u2014otherwise!\u201d\n\n\n The door at the back of the theater opened quietly,  and Peggy, turning around in her seat, saw a few of  the actresses entering. They quietly found seats in  the rear and settled down to await their turn.\n\n\n \u201cI think I\u2019ll go back there with the girls,\u201d Peggy  whispered. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a girl I met at the casting  call, and I\u2019d like to chat with her for a few minutes  when she comes. Do you mind if I don\u2019t look at all  this?\u201d\n\n\n Randy grinned. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019d get out of here,  too, if I could without getting Mal mad at me. This  kind of thing always breaks my heart, too!\u201d\n\n15\n\n As she went up the aisle as unobtrusively as possible,  Peggy glanced at the actresses who had just  come in. She recognized a few of their faces from  the casting call of three days ago, but did not see her  new friend among them. She decided to go out to the  lobby to wait for her there. A new group of girls  entered the theater as Peggy was leaving and, as she  passed, one reached out and grabbed her arm.\n\n\n Peggy turned in surprise to find herself greeted  with a broad grin and a quick companionable kiss.\n\n\n \u201cGreta!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cCome on out to the lobby, and I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Greta  Larsen said, with a toss of her head that made her  thick blond braid spin around and settle over her  shoulder.\n\n\n \u201cBut I thought you were in New Haven, getting  ready to open Over the Hill ,\u201d Peggy said, when they  had reached the lobby. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing  here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t read your Variety very carefully,\u201d  Greta said. \u201c Over the Hill opened in New  Haven to such bad notices that the producer decided  to close out of town. At first we thought he\u2019d  call in a play doctor to try to fix things up, but he  finally decided, and very sensibly, that it would be  easier to just throw the whole thing out. I\u2019m afraid  he lost a lot of money, and he didn\u2019t have any more  left.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cAnd it was a real  chance for you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n16\n\n \u201cNot really,\u201d Greta said. \u201cThe part wasn\u2019t too  good, and I\u2019d just as soon not be in a disaster. Anyway,  it gave me a chance to work for a few weeks,  and an agent saw me and said he thought I was  good, so maybe I\u2019m not any the worse for the experience.\u201d\n\n\n At that moment, Peggy saw Paula Andrews enter  the lobby, and she motioned to her to join them.  \u201cGreta, this is Paula Andrews. She\u2019s reading for the  lead today, and I hope she gets it. Paula, I want you  to meet Greta Larsen, one of my housemates.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHousemates?\u201d Paula questioned, a little puzzled.\n\n\n \u201cYes. There are about a dozen of us, more or less.  We live in a place called the Gramercy Arms\u2014a  wonderful place\u2014and we live like one big noisy family.  The Arms is run just for young actresses, so we  all have a lot in common. I haven\u2019t seen Greta for  weeks\u2014she\u2019s been out of town with a play\u2014and I\u2019m  just getting over being stunned at seeing her now.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPeggy tactfully neglected to mention that the  play flopped,\u201d Greta laughed, \u201cand now I\u2019m back in  town without a job. In fact, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to read for Mal?\u201d Peggy  asked excitedly.\n\n\n \u201cUh-huh. I met him on the street an hour or so  ago, and he told me he had a part he thought I should  try out for, and that he was thinking of me for it all  along, but assumed that I wouldn\u2019t be available.  Well, you can\u2019t be more available than I am, so here  I am!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHave you read the play?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m lucky there,\u201d Greta replied. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it  in three different drafts since it started. Peggy\u2019s  friendly with Randy Brewster, the boy who wrote it,  and each time she brought a draft home, I got to  read it. So I\u2019m not at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\n17\n\n \u201cWhat do you think of Come Closer , Paula?\u201d asked  Peggy.\n\n\n \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful! I hope more than ever that  I get the part! Do you really think I have a chance?\u201d\n\n\n Greta nodded decisively. \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re  made for it,\u201d she said.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s just what Peggy said!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy stole a glance through the doors to the theater.  \u201cI think we\u2019re about ready to find out whether or  not you can act,\u201d she said. \u201cThey seem to be about  through with the actors, and that means you\u2019re on  next!\u201d\n\n\n Wishing each other good luck, they entered the  darkened part of the house and prepared for what  Peggy could only think of as their ordeal. Afterward, as Peggy, Amy, Paula, and Greta sat at  a table in a nearby coffeehouse waiting for Mal and  Randy to join them, each was sure that she had been  terrible.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no!\u201d Peggy said. \u201cYou two were just marvelous!  But I couldn\u2019t have been worse. I know I read  the part wrong. I thought I had the character clear in  my mind, but I\u2019m sure that the way it came out was a  mile off!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou have a lot more talent than judgment,\u201d Greta  said mournfully. \u201cYou were perfect. And so was  Paula. As for me....\u201d Her voice trailed off in despair.\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can say that, Greta,\u201d Paula  put in. \u201cI know you were the best in your part, and  nobody even came close to Peggy. But I\u2019ve never  felt so off in my life as I did reading that part. It\u2019s a  wonder any of you even want to be seen with me!\u201d\n\n18\n\n Only when Amy started to laugh did the three  others realize how much alike they had sounded.  Then they joined in the laughter and couldn\u2019t seem  to stop. When they seemed at the point of dissolving  helplessly into a permanent attack of the giggles,  Randy and Mal joined them.\n\n\n \u201cIf you\u2019re laughing at the play,\u201d Randy said  gloomily, \u201cI can hardly blame you. You never know  just how badly you\u2019ve written until someone gets up  and starts to read your lines.\u201d\n\n\n All at the same time, the girls started to reassure  him and tell him how good the play was, and how  badly the actors, including themselves, had handled  the lines, but this was so much like their last exchange  of conversation that once more they broke up  in helpless laughter.\n\n\n When they got their breath back, and when coffee  and pastry had been ordered, they tried to explain  the cause of their hilarity to the boys.\n\n\n \u201c... so, you see,\u201d Peggy concluded, \u201cwe were  each explaining how good the others were and how  bad we were, and when Randy started telling us how  bad he had been as a writer, we just couldn\u2019t stand  it!\u201d\n\n\n It was Mal who got them back to sane ground.  With his tough face, like a movie gangster\u2019s or private  detective\u2019s, and his gentle, cultured English voice and  assured manner, he calmly gave his opinion of the  afternoon\u2019s auditions.

I can\u2019t help feeling  sorry for them\u2014for all of us, I mean. After all, I\u2019m  trying for a part, too.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy\u2019s friend and housemate, Amy Preston,  smiled in agreement and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy business,  honey, is it? But the ones I feel sorriest for  right now are Mal and Randy. After all, they have  the unpleasant job of choosing and refusing, and a  lot of these folks are their friends. I wouldn\u2019t want  to be in their shoes.\u201d\n\n2\n\n Peggy nodded thoughtfully, and reflected that it  must, indeed, be more wearing on the boys. Mallory  Seton, director of the new play, had been an upper-class  student at the Academy when Peggy had  started there, and he was a good friend of hers. She  had worked with him before, as a general assistant,  when they had discovered a theater. It would not be  easy for him to consider Peggy for an acting role, and  to do so completely without bias. It would not be a  question of playing favorites, Peggy knew, but quite  the reverse. Mal\u2019s sense of fair play would make him  bend over backward to keep from giving favors to  his friends. If she was to get a role in this new production,  she would really have to work for it.\n\n\n And if it was difficult for Mal, she thought, it was  more so for Randy Brewster, the author of the play,  for her friendship with him was of a different sort  than with Mal. Mal was just a friend\u2014a good one,  to be sure\u2014but with Randy Brewster, somehow,  things were different. There was nothing \u201cserious,\u201d  she assured herself, but they had gone on dates together  with a regularity that was a little more than  casual and, whatever his feelings were for her, she  was sure that they were more complicated than  Mal\u2019s.\n\n\n \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll ever get through all these  people?\u201d Amy asked, interrupting her thoughts.  \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors read for  them in just one afternoon?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, they won\u2019t be doing readings today,\u201d Peggy  replied, glad to turn her attention from what was becoming  a difficult subject for thought. \u201cThis is just a  first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people  for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones, send  the impossible ones away, and then go into elimination  readings later.\u201d\n\n3\n\n \u201cBut what if the people they pick for looks can\u2019t  act?\u201d Amy asked. \u201cAnd what if some of the rejects  are wonderful actors?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects,\u201d Peggy explained,  \u201cbecause they both have a pretty good idea  of what the characters in the play should look like.  And if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors,  then they hold another cast call and try again.  Mal says that sometimes certain parts are so hard to  cast that they have to go through a dozen calls just  to find one actor.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt seems kind of unfair, doesn\u2019t it, to be eliminated  just because you\u2019re not the right physical  type,\u201d Amy said, \u201cbut I can understand it. They have  to start somewhere, and I guess that\u2019s as good a place  as any.\u201d Then she smiled and added, \u201cI guess I\u2019m  just feeling sorry for myself, because Mal told me  there was no sense in my trying out at all, because I  didn\u2019t look or sound right for any part in the play. If  I don\u2019t get rid of this Southern accent of mine, I  may never get a part at all, except in a Tennessee  Williams play!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded sympathetically. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just  your accent, Amy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s your looks, too. At  least for this play. Mal and Randy told you that  you\u2019re just too pretty for any of the parts that fit  your age, and that\u2019s nothing to feel bad about. If  anybody ought to feel insulted, it\u2019s me, because  they asked me to try out!\u201d\n\n4\n\n \u201cOh, they were just sweet-talking me,\u201d Amy replied.  \u201cAnd as for you, you know you don\u2019t have to  worry about your looks. You have a wonderful face!  You can look beautiful, or comic, or pathetic, or  cute or anything. I\u2019m stuck with just being a South\u2019n  Belle, blond and helpless, po\u2019 li\u2019l ol\u2019 me, lookin\u2019 sad  and sweet through those ol\u2019 magnolia blossoms!\u201d  She broadened her slight, soft accent until it sounded  like something you could spread on hot cornbread,  and both girls broke into laughter that sounded odd  in the strained atmosphere of the bare rehearsal  studio.\n\n\n It was at this point that Mal and Randy came in,  with pleasant, if somewhat brisk, nods to the assembled  actors and actresses, and a special smile for  Amy and Peggy. In a businesslike manner, they settled  themselves at a table near the windows, spread  out scripts and pads and pencils, and prepared for  the chore that faced them. Amy, who was there to  help the boys by acting as secretary for the occasion,  wished Peggy good luck, and joined the boys at the  table. Her job was to take names and addresses, and  to jot down any facts about each actor that Randy  and Mal wanted to be sure to remember.\n\n\n Mal started the proceedings by introducing himself  and Randy. Then, estimating the crowd, he said,  \u201cSince there are fewer men here, and also fewer male  roles to cast, we\u2019re going to do them first. I hope that  you ladies won\u2019t mind. We won\u2019t keep you waiting  long, but if we worked with you first, we\u2019d have these  gentlemen waiting most of the day. Shall we get  started?\u201d After a brief glance at his notes, he called  out, \u201cFirst, I\u2019d like to see businessman types, young  forties. How many have we?\u201d\n\n5\n\n Four men separated themselves from the crowd  and approached the table. Peggy watched with interest  as Mal and Randy looked them over, murmured  to Amy to take notes, and asked questions.  After a few minutes, the men left, two of them looking  happy, two resigned. Then Mal stood and called  for leading man types, late twenties or early thirties,  tall and athletic. As six tall, athletic, handsome  young men came forward, Peggy felt that she just  couldn\u2019t stand watching the casting interviews any  longer. It reminded her too much of the livestock  shows she had attended as a youngster in her home  town of Rockport, Wisconsin. Necessary though it  was, she felt it was hardly a way to have to deal  with human beings.\n\n\n Slipping back through the crowd of waiting actors,  she joined the actresses in the rear of the room, and  found an empty seat next to a young girl.\n\n\n \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, can\u2019t you watch  it either?\u201d\n\n\n The girl smiled in understanding. \u201cIt always upsets  me,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut it\u2019s something we simply  have to learn to live with. At least until we get well-known,  or get agents to do this sort of thing for us.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt sounds as if you\u2019ve been in a few of these before,\u201d  Peggy said.\n\n\n \u201cI have. But not here in the East,\u201d the girl replied.  \u201cI\u2019m from California, and I\u2019ve been in a few little-theater  things there, but nobody seems to pay much  attention to them. I heard that off-Broadway theater  in New York attracts a lot of critics, and I thought  that I\u2019d do better here. Have you had any luck?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m just beginning,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cI\u2019m still  studying at the New York Dramatic Academy. I hope  I can get some kind of supporting role in this play,  but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for anything big yet. By  the way, my name is Peggy Lane. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\n6\n\n \u201cI\u2019m Paula Andrews,\u201d the girl answered, \u201cand  maybe I\u2019m shooting too high, but I\u2019m trying out for  the female lead. I hope I have a chance for it.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy looked carefully at her new friend, at the  somewhat uncertain smile that played about her  well-formed, generous mouth and the intelligence  that shone from her large, widely placed green eyes.  Her rather long face was saved from severity by a  soft halo of red-brown hair, the whole effect being an  appealing combination of strength and feminine softness.\n\n\n \u201cI think you do have a chance,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cIn  fact, if you can act, I bet you\u2019ll get the part. I\u2019ve read  the play, and I know the author and director, and  unless I\u2019m way off, you look just the way the lead  should look. In fact, it\u2019s almost uncanny. You look as  if you just walked out of the script!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I hope you\u2019re right!\u201d Paula said with animation.  \u201cAnd I hope you get a part, too. I have a feeling  that you\u2019re going to bring me good luck!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThe one who needs luck is me, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Peggy  said. \u201cBeing friendly with Randy and Mal isn\u2019t going  to help me in the least, and I\u2019m going to have to be  awfully good to get the part. And it\u2019s really important  to me, too, because I\u2019m getting near the end of  my trial year.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTrial year?\u201d Paula asked curiously.\n\n7\n\n \u201cUh-huh. My parents agreed to let me come to  New York to study acting and try for parts for a year,  and I agreed that if I didn\u2019t show signs of success  before the year was up, I\u2019d come home and go back  to college. I\u2019ve been here for eight months now, and  I haven\u2019t got anything to show my parents yet. The  part I\u2019m trying for now isn\u2019t a big one, but it\u2019s a good  supporting role, and what\u2019s more, we get paid. If I  can show my mother and father that I can earn some  money by acting, I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll let me go on  trying.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut do you expect to make enough to live on right  away?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no! I\u2019m not that na\u00efve! But when my year is  over at the Academy, I can always take a job as a  typist or a secretary somewhere, while I look for  parts. If you can type and take shorthand, you never  have to worry about making a living.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI wish that I could do those things,\u201d Paula said  wistfully. \u201cThe only way I\u2019ve been able to make ends  meet is by working in department stores as a salesgirl,  and that doesn\u2019t pay much. Besides, the work is  so unsteady.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMy parents are very practical people,\u201d Peggy said  with a smile, \u201cand they made sure that I learned  routine office skills before they would let me think  about other and more glamorous kinds of careers.  Daddy owns the newspaper in our small town in  Wisconsin, and I\u2019ve worked with him as a typist and  a reporter of sorts and as a proofreader, too. I\u2019ll always  be grateful that he made me learn all those  things. I don\u2019t think he has much faith in the acting  business, but he\u2019s been wonderful about giving me a  chance. What do your parents think of your wanting  to be an actress?\u201d\n\n\n Instead of answering, Paula suddenly stood up.  \u201cLet\u2019s go see how they\u2019re coming with the actors,\u201d she  said. \u201cI think they\u2019re almost finished.\u201d\n\n8\n\n Not wanting to press Paula further, and feeling  that perhaps she had asked too personal a question  on such short acquaintance, Peggy reluctantly stood  too, and joined Paula to watch the last of what she  now could only think of as the livestock show.\n\n\n As she drew closer to the table, she heard Mal saying,  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Lang, but you\u2019re just not  the right type for the role. Perhaps some other....\u201d  and his voice trailed off in embarrassment.\n\n\n Lang, a short, thin, unhappy young man, answered  almost tearfully, \u201cBut, Mr. Seton, looks aren\u2019t everything.  I\u2019m really a funny comedian. Honestly! If you  would only give me a chance to read for you, I know  that I could make you change your mind about the  way this character should look!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that you could,\u201d Mal said gently,  \u201cbut if you did, the play would suffer. I\u2019m afraid the  comedian we need for this must be a large, rather  bluff-looking person, like these three gentlemen  whom I have chosen to hear. The part calls for it.  I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n Mr. Lang nodded sadly, mumbled, \u201cI understand,\u201d  and walked off, his head hanging and his  hands thrust deep in his pockets, looking less like a  comedian than any man in the world. Peggy  watched him go, not knowing whether to feel sorrier  for him or for Mal.\n\n\n \u201cAll right, gentlemen,\u201d Mal called out. \u201cThat takes  care of the male roles. All of you who are left will be  given copies of the play to study, marked at the passages  I want to hear. Be sure to read the whole play  carefully, so that you understand the workings of the  characters you have been selected to read. You have  three days to look it over. We\u2019ll meet at ten o\u2019clock  on Saturday morning at the Penthouse Theater to  hear you. Thank you. And now for the ladies.\u201d\n\n9\n\n The men left, after being given their scripts, and  though they chatted amiably with one another,  Peggy was sure that each was casting rather hostile  looks toward others who were trying for the same  parts. Keeping friendships in the theater was not an  easy thing, she thought, particularly for people of  similar physical types!\n\n\n Mal\u2019s first concern in reviewing the actresses was,  of course, for the leading role. And, of course, it was  for this role that he had the most applicants. More  than twenty girls came forward when the announcement  was made, and Peggy thought that she had  never seen so many striking and beautiful faces and  figures. It was not going to be easy for Mal to make a  choice. As Paula, her new friend, went forward to  join the others, Peggy whispered a word of encouragement,  then stood to one side to watch.\n\n\n Mal went down the line, regretfully dismissing one  after the other of the girls, and occasionally asking  one to step aside to try for another role. His tough-looking  expression hardly varied as he spoke to each  one, but Peggy thought she saw the ghost of a smile  cross his face when he spoke to Paula Andrews. Another  review of the remaining girls eliminated a few  more. Finally, there were only four left, Paula  among them. Mal thanked them, distributed scripts,  and asked them to be at the Penthouse Theater on  Saturday at noon.\n\n\n Paula returned to Peggy with eyes shining. \u201cOh,  Peggy! I think you were right! I just know I\u2019m going  to get the part! I know it!\u201d\n\n10\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t count too much on it,\u201d Peggy cautioned,  \u201cor you may be too bitterly disappointed if you don\u2019t  get it. But,\u201d she added, enthusiastically violating her  own rule of caution, \u201cI\u2019m sure, too! I\u2019ll see you Saturday.  Even if I don\u2019t get a script, I\u2019ll be there just to  hear you read!\u201d\n\n\n Then, with a smile of farewell, Peggy turned her  attention to the \u201ccareer woman, early thirties\u201d classification  that Mal had called for next. Once that  was out of the way, she knew it would be her turn.\n\n\n This time, there were not so many applicants and  Peggy remembered Randy telling her that this  would be one of their most difficult roles to cast.  Only four actresses came forward, and Mal, with  difficulty, reviewed them all. Unable to eliminate by  type, he gave them all scripts and asked them to  come to the theater. Then he called for \u201ccharacter  ing\u00e9nues\u201d and Peggy joined seven other girls in the  \u201clivestock show.\u201d\n\n\n Mal reviewed them carefully, managing to look at  Peggy with complete lack of recognition. He gently  eliminated three of them on the basis of hair coloring,  height or general type. Another, curiously  enough, was eliminated, like Amy, for a Southern accent,  and a fifth, also like Amy, was too beautiful.  \u201cThe part calls for a pretty girl,\u201d Mal said with a rare  smile, \u201cbut not for a girl so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate  the stage! It was a pleasure to look at you, but I\u2019m  afraid you\u2019re not quite right for the part.\u201d\n\n\n When he was done, Peggy and two others were  given scripts and told to come to the theater on Saturday.  Feeling lightheaded and giddy, Peggy settled  herself on one of the folding chairs that lined  the back wall, and waited for Mal, Randy, and Amy  to finish so she could join them for coffee.\n\n11\n\n Scarcely noticing the rest of the proceedings, she  thought only about the coming readings. She was  so familiar with the play that she knew she had an  advantage, perhaps unfairly, over the other two girls.  She had watched the script grow from its first rough  draft to the finished text now in her hands, and had  discussed it with Randy through each revision. She  knew she could play the part; in fact, she suspected  secretly that Randy had written it for her, and the  thought made her blush. Still, it would not be easy,  she knew. Mal\u2019s sense of fairness and his absolute  devotion to the play above everything else would  keep him from making up his mind in advance.\n\n\n But despite this knowledge, she could not help  looking ahead\u2014all the way ahead\u2014to the restless  stir of the opening-night audience out front, the last-minute  preparations backstage, the bright, hot lights  and the smell of make-up and scenery paint as she  waited to go on in Act One, Scene One of Come  Closer , Randy Brewster\u2019s brilliant new play in which  Peggy Lane would be discovered!\n\n12 II\n\n The Hopefuls The audience consisted of a handful of actors and  actresses, and Randy Brewster and Mallory Seton.  The stage lighting was a cold splash produced by two  floodlights without color gels to soften them. The  scenery was the brick back wall of the stage, two  ladders, a table and two straight-backed chairs. Only  the front row of house lights was on, and the back of  the theater was dark, empty and gloomy, a shadowy  wasteland of empty rows of seats like tombstones.\n\n\n On the stage, a \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was reading  his lines. Peggy knew, after the first few words, that  he would not do. He had somehow completely  missed the character of the man he was portraying,  and was heavily overplaying. Mal, being perhaps  more patient than Peggy, listened and watched  with great care. Amy, who was acting as Mal\u2019s assistant  for the production, sat in a chair by the proscenium,  reading her script by the light of a small  lamp and feeding the actor cue lines. Mal followed  the whole sequence with no visible sign of impatience  and, when the actor was through, said,  \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you know our decision in a day  or two.\u201d\n\n13\n\n The next \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was better, but still  not quite on target, Peggy thought. He seemed to be  playing the part for laughs, and although there were  some comic values to be extracted from the role, it  was really far more a straight dramatic character.  Still, he was clearly a better actor than the first,  and with direction might do well.\n\n\n Following his reading, Mal again repeated his  polite, invariable formula, \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you  know our decision in a day or two,\u201d and called for  the next reading.\n\n\n Peggy watched the remaining actors try for the  role, and made mental notes of which ones were possible,  which probable, and which stood no chance at  all.\n\n\n The same process was then followed for the leading  men, and the same wide range of talent and understanding  of the part was displayed. Some seemed  to have no idea at all about the play or its meaning,  and Peggy was sure that these men had read only  the parts marked for them. Others had a clear understanding  of the kind of character they were playing,  and tried to create him in the brief time they had on  stage. Others still were actors who had one rather  inflexible way of playing, and used it for all kinds of  parts. Their performances were uniform imitations of  each other, and all were imitations of the early acting  style of Marlon Brando. They seemed to forget,  Peggy thought, that Brando\u2019s style developed  from the roles he had to play, and that as he got  other roles, he showed other facets of a rounded talent.  It made her angry that some actors thought  they could get ahead in a creative field by being  imitative.\n\n14\n\n Each actor, no matter how good or how bad, was  treated with impersonal courtesy by Mal, and each  left looking sure that the part was his. Peggy was  glad that she would not have to see their faces when  they learned that they had not been selected.\n\n\n \u201cThe pity of it,\u201d she whispered to Randy, \u201cisn\u2019t  that there are so many bad ones, but that there are  so many good ones, and that only one can be selected  for each role. I wish there were some way of telling  the good ones you can\u2019t take that they were really  good, but that you just couldn\u2019t take everyone!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou can\u2019t let yourself worry about that,\u201d Randy  replied. \u201cThe good ones know they\u2019re good, and  they\u2019re not going to be discouraged by the loss of a  role. And the bad ones think they\u2019re good, too, and  most of them have tremendous egos to protect  them from ever finding out\u2014or even thinking\u2014otherwise!\u201d\n\n\n The door at the back of the theater opened quietly,  and Peggy, turning around in her seat, saw a few of  the actresses entering. They quietly found seats in  the rear and settled down to await their turn.\n\n\n \u201cI think I\u2019ll go back there with the girls,\u201d Peggy  whispered. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a girl I met at the casting  call, and I\u2019d like to chat with her for a few minutes  when she comes. Do you mind if I don\u2019t look at all  this?\u201d\n\n\n Randy grinned. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019d get out of here,  too, if I could without getting Mal mad at me. This  kind of thing always breaks my heart, too!\u201d\n\n15\n\n As she went up the aisle as unobtrusively as possible,  Peggy glanced at the actresses who had just  come in. She recognized a few of their faces from  the casting call of three days ago, but did not see her  new friend among them. She decided to go out to the  lobby to wait for her there. A new group of girls  entered the theater as Peggy was leaving and, as she  passed, one reached out and grabbed her arm.\n\n\n Peggy turned in surprise to find herself greeted  with a broad grin and a quick companionable kiss.\n\n\n \u201cGreta!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cCome on out to the lobby, and I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Greta  Larsen said, with a toss of her head that made her  thick blond braid spin around and settle over her  shoulder.\n\n\n \u201cBut I thought you were in New Haven, getting  ready to open Over the Hill ,\u201d Peggy said, when they  had reached the lobby. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing  here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t read your Variety very carefully,\u201d  Greta said. \u201c Over the Hill opened in New  Haven to such bad notices that the producer decided  to close out of town. At first we thought he\u2019d  call in a play doctor to try to fix things up, but he  finally decided, and very sensibly, that it would be  easier to just throw the whole thing out. I\u2019m afraid  he lost a lot of money, and he didn\u2019t have any more  left.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cAnd it was a real  chance for you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n16\n\n \u201cNot really,\u201d Greta said. \u201cThe part wasn\u2019t too  good, and I\u2019d just as soon not be in a disaster. Anyway,  it gave me a chance to work for a few weeks,  and an agent saw me and said he thought I was  good, so maybe I\u2019m not any the worse for the experience.\u201d\n\n\n At that moment, Peggy saw Paula Andrews enter  the lobby, and she motioned to her to join them.  \u201cGreta, this is Paula Andrews. She\u2019s reading for the  lead today, and I hope she gets it. Paula, I want you  to meet Greta Larsen, one of my housemates.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHousemates?\u201d Paula questioned, a little puzzled.\n\n\n \u201cYes. There are about a dozen of us, more or less.  We live in a place called the Gramercy Arms\u2014a  wonderful place\u2014and we live like one big noisy family.  The Arms is run just for young actresses, so we  all have a lot in common. I haven\u2019t seen Greta for  weeks\u2014she\u2019s been out of town with a play\u2014and I\u2019m  just getting over being stunned at seeing her now.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPeggy tactfully neglected to mention that the  play flopped,\u201d Greta laughed, \u201cand now I\u2019m back in  town without a job. In fact, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to read for Mal?\u201d Peggy  asked excitedly.\n\n\n \u201cUh-huh. I met him on the street an hour or so  ago, and he told me he had a part he thought I should  try out for, and that he was thinking of me for it all  along, but assumed that I wouldn\u2019t be available.  Well, you can\u2019t be more available than I am, so here  I am!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHave you read the play?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m lucky there,\u201d Greta replied. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it  in three different drafts since it started. Peggy\u2019s  friendly with Randy Brewster, the boy who wrote it,  and each time she brought a draft home, I got to  read it. So I\u2019m not at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\n17\n\n \u201cWhat do you think of Come Closer , Paula?\u201d asked  Peggy.\n\n\n \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful! I hope more than ever that  I get the part! Do you really think I have a chance?\u201d\n\n\n Greta nodded decisively. \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re  made for it,\u201d she said.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s just what Peggy said!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy stole a glance through the doors to the theater.  \u201cI think we\u2019re about ready to find out whether or  not you can act,\u201d she said. \u201cThey seem to be about  through with the actors, and that means you\u2019re on  next!\u201d\n\n\n Wishing each other good luck, they entered the  darkened part of the house and prepared for what  Peggy could only think of as their ordeal. Afterward, as Peggy, Amy, Paula, and Greta sat at  a table in a nearby coffeehouse waiting for Mal and  Randy to join them, each was sure that she had been  terrible.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no!\u201d Peggy said. \u201cYou two were just marvelous!  But I couldn\u2019t have been worse. I know I read  the part wrong. I thought I had the character clear in  my mind, but I\u2019m sure that the way it came out was a  mile off!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou have a lot more talent than judgment,\u201d Greta  said mournfully. \u201cYou were perfect. And so was  Paula. As for me....\u201d Her voice trailed off in despair.\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can say that, Greta,\u201d Paula  put in. \u201cI know you were the best in your part, and  nobody even came close to Peggy. But I\u2019ve never  felt so off in my life as I did reading that part. It\u2019s a  wonder any of you even want to be seen with me!\u201d\n\n18\n\n Only when Amy started to laugh did the three  others realize how much alike they had sounded.  Then they joined in the laughter and couldn\u2019t seem  to stop. When they seemed at the point of dissolving  helplessly into a permanent attack of the giggles,  Randy and Mal joined them.\n\n\n \u201cIf you\u2019re laughing at the play,\u201d Randy said  gloomily, \u201cI can hardly blame you. You never know  just how badly you\u2019ve written until someone gets up  and starts to read your lines.\u201d\n\n\n All at the same time, the girls started to reassure  him and tell him how good the play was, and how  badly the actors, including themselves, had handled  the lines, but this was so much like their last exchange  of conversation that once more they broke up  in helpless laughter.\n\n\n When they got their breath back, and when coffee  and pastry had been ordered, they tried to explain  the cause of their hilarity to the boys.\n\n\n \u201c... so, you see,\u201d Peggy concluded, \u201cwe were  each explaining how good the others were and how  bad we were, and when Randy started telling us how  bad he had been as a writer, we just couldn\u2019t stand  it!\u201d\n\n\n It was Mal who got them back to sane ground.  With his tough face, like a movie gangster\u2019s or private  detective\u2019s, and his gentle, cultured English voice and  assured manner, he calmly gave his opinion of the  afternoon\u2019s auditions. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the story teach the reader about their process of casting?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Acting ability is most important before looks\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Elimination Readings Determine the Final Cast  \n   \u2022 Mal and Randy listen patiently to each reading despite \u201cwide range of talent.\u201d They must \u201clet you know our decision\u201d only after seeing each actor\u2019s performance (para. 12\u201314).  \n   \u2022 Actors wrong for the part physically but strong in acting (e.g., imitative Brando style) are remarked on but still evaluated for possible direction.  \n\nII.

That exception actually confirms look matters only when required by character, not universally. If he had truly unmatched talent for an unrestricted role, they\u2019d consider it.  \n 2.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

I can\u2019t help feeling  sorry for them\u2014for all of us, I mean. After all, I\u2019m  trying for a part, too.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy\u2019s friend and housemate, Amy Preston,  smiled in agreement and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy business,  honey, is it? But the ones I feel sorriest for  right now are Mal and Randy. After all, they have  the unpleasant job of choosing and refusing, and a  lot of these folks are their friends. I wouldn\u2019t want  to be in their shoes.\u201d\n\n2\n\n Peggy nodded thoughtfully, and reflected that it  must, indeed, be more wearing on the boys. Mallory  Seton, director of the new play, had been an upper-class  student at the Academy when Peggy had  started there, and he was a good friend of hers. She  had worked with him before, as a general assistant,  when they had discovered a theater. It would not be  easy for him to consider Peggy for an acting role, and  to do so completely without bias. It would not be a  question of playing favorites, Peggy knew, but quite  the reverse. Mal\u2019s sense of fair play would make him  bend over backward to keep from giving favors to  his friends. If she was to get a role in this new production,  she would really have to work for it.\n\n\n And if it was difficult for Mal, she thought, it was  more so for Randy Brewster, the author of the play,  for her friendship with him was of a different sort  than with Mal. Mal was just a friend\u2014a good one,  to be sure\u2014but with Randy Brewster, somehow,  things were different. There was nothing \u201cserious,\u201d  she assured herself, but they had gone on dates together  with a regularity that was a little more than  casual and, whatever his feelings were for her, she  was sure that they were more complicated than  Mal\u2019s.\n\n\n \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll ever get through all these  people?\u201d Amy asked, interrupting her thoughts.  \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors read for  them in just one afternoon?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, they won\u2019t be doing readings today,\u201d Peggy  replied, glad to turn her attention from what was becoming  a difficult subject for thought. \u201cThis is just a  first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people  for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones, send  the impossible ones away, and then go into elimination  readings later.\u201d\n\n3\n\n \u201cBut what if the people they pick for looks can\u2019t  act?\u201d Amy asked. \u201cAnd what if some of the rejects  are wonderful actors?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects,\u201d Peggy explained,  \u201cbecause they both have a pretty good idea  of what the characters in the play should look like.  And if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors,  then they hold another cast call and try again.  Mal says that sometimes certain parts are so hard to  cast that they have to go through a dozen calls just  to find one actor.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt seems kind of unfair, doesn\u2019t it, to be eliminated  just because you\u2019re not the right physical  type,\u201d Amy said, \u201cbut I can understand it. They have  to start somewhere, and I guess that\u2019s as good a place  as any.\u201d Then she smiled and added, \u201cI guess I\u2019m  just feeling sorry for myself, because Mal told me  there was no sense in my trying out at all, because I  didn\u2019t look or sound right for any part in the play. If  I don\u2019t get rid of this Southern accent of mine, I  may never get a part at all, except in a Tennessee  Williams play!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded sympathetically. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just  your accent, Amy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s your looks, too. At  least for this play. Mal and Randy told you that  you\u2019re just too pretty for any of the parts that fit  your age, and that\u2019s nothing to feel bad about. If  anybody ought to feel insulted, it\u2019s me, because  they asked me to try out!\u201d\n\n4\n\n \u201cOh, they were just sweet-talking me,\u201d Amy replied.  \u201cAnd as for you, you know you don\u2019t have to  worry about your looks. You have a wonderful face!  You can look beautiful, or comic, or pathetic, or  cute or anything. I\u2019m stuck with just being a South\u2019n  Belle, blond and helpless, po\u2019 li\u2019l ol\u2019 me, lookin\u2019 sad  and sweet through those ol\u2019 magnolia blossoms!\u201d  She broadened her slight, soft accent until it sounded  like something you could spread on hot cornbread,  and both girls broke into laughter that sounded odd  in the strained atmosphere of the bare rehearsal  studio.\n\n\n It was at this point that Mal and Randy came in,  with pleasant, if somewhat brisk, nods to the assembled  actors and actresses, and a special smile for  Amy and Peggy. In a businesslike manner, they settled  themselves at a table near the windows, spread  out scripts and pads and pencils, and prepared for  the chore that faced them. Amy, who was there to  help the boys by acting as secretary for the occasion,  wished Peggy good luck, and joined the boys at the  table. Her job was to take names and addresses, and  to jot down any facts about each actor that Randy  and Mal wanted to be sure to remember.\n\n\n Mal started the proceedings by introducing himself  and Randy. Then, estimating the crowd, he said,  \u201cSince there are fewer men here, and also fewer male  roles to cast, we\u2019re going to do them first. I hope that  you ladies won\u2019t mind. We won\u2019t keep you waiting  long, but if we worked with you first, we\u2019d have these  gentlemen waiting most of the day. Shall we get  started?\u201d After a brief glance at his notes, he called  out, \u201cFirst, I\u2019d like to see businessman types, young  forties. How many have we?\u201d\n\n5\n\n Four men separated themselves from the crowd  and approached the table. Peggy watched with interest  as Mal and Randy looked them over, murmured  to Amy to take notes, and asked questions.  After a few minutes, the men left, two of them looking  happy, two resigned. Then Mal stood and called  for leading man types, late twenties or early thirties,  tall and athletic. As six tall, athletic, handsome  young men came forward, Peggy felt that she just  couldn\u2019t stand watching the casting interviews any  longer. It reminded her too much of the livestock  shows she had attended as a youngster in her home  town of Rockport, Wisconsin. Necessary though it  was, she felt it was hardly a way to have to deal  with human beings.\n\n\n Slipping back through the crowd of waiting actors,  she joined the actresses in the rear of the room, and  found an empty seat next to a young girl.\n\n\n \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, can\u2019t you watch  it either?\u201d\n\n\n The girl smiled in understanding. \u201cIt always upsets  me,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut it\u2019s something we simply  have to learn to live with. At least until we get well-known,  or get agents to do this sort of thing for us.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt sounds as if you\u2019ve been in a few of these before,\u201d  Peggy said.\n\n\n \u201cI have. But not here in the East,\u201d the girl replied.  \u201cI\u2019m from California, and I\u2019ve been in a few little-theater  things there, but nobody seems to pay much  attention to them. I heard that off-Broadway theater  in New York attracts a lot of critics, and I thought  that I\u2019d do better here. Have you had any luck?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m just beginning,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cI\u2019m still  studying at the New York Dramatic Academy. I hope  I can get some kind of supporting role in this play,  but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for anything big yet. By  the way, my name is Peggy Lane. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\n6\n\n \u201cI\u2019m Paula Andrews,\u201d the girl answered, \u201cand  maybe I\u2019m shooting too high, but I\u2019m trying out for  the female lead. I hope I have a chance for it.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy looked carefully at her new friend, at the  somewhat uncertain smile that played about her  well-formed, generous mouth and the intelligence  that shone from her large, widely placed green eyes.  Her rather long face was saved from severity by a  soft halo of red-brown hair, the whole effect being an  appealing combination of strength and feminine softness.\n\n\n \u201cI think you do have a chance,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cIn  fact, if you can act, I bet you\u2019ll get the part. I\u2019ve read  the play, and I know the author and director, and  unless I\u2019m way off, you look just the way the lead  should look. In fact, it\u2019s almost uncanny. You look as  if you just walked out of the script!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I hope you\u2019re right!\u201d Paula said with animation.  \u201cAnd I hope you get a part, too. I have a feeling  that you\u2019re going to bring me good luck!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThe one who needs luck is me, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Peggy  said. \u201cBeing friendly with Randy and Mal isn\u2019t going  to help me in the least, and I\u2019m going to have to be  awfully good to get the part. And it\u2019s really important  to me, too, because I\u2019m getting near the end of  my trial year.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTrial year?\u201d Paula asked curiously.\n\n7\n\n \u201cUh-huh. My parents agreed to let me come to  New York to study acting and try for parts for a year,  and I agreed that if I didn\u2019t show signs of success  before the year was up, I\u2019d come home and go back  to college. I\u2019ve been here for eight months now, and  I haven\u2019t got anything to show my parents yet. The  part I\u2019m trying for now isn\u2019t a big one, but it\u2019s a good  supporting role, and what\u2019s more, we get paid. If I  can show my mother and father that I can earn some  money by acting, I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll let me go on  trying.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut do you expect to make enough to live on right  away?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no! I\u2019m not that na\u00efve! But when my year is  over at the Academy, I can always take a job as a  typist or a secretary somewhere, while I look for  parts. If you can type and take shorthand, you never  have to worry about making a living.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI wish that I could do those things,\u201d Paula said  wistfully. \u201cThe only way I\u2019ve been able to make ends  meet is by working in department stores as a salesgirl,  and that doesn\u2019t pay much. Besides, the work is  so unsteady.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMy parents are very practical people,\u201d Peggy said  with a smile, \u201cand they made sure that I learned  routine office skills before they would let me think  about other and more glamorous kinds of careers.  Daddy owns the newspaper in our small town in  Wisconsin, and I\u2019ve worked with him as a typist and  a reporter of sorts and as a proofreader, too. I\u2019ll always  be grateful that he made me learn all those  things. I don\u2019t think he has much faith in the acting  business, but he\u2019s been wonderful about giving me a  chance. What do your parents think of your wanting  to be an actress?\u201d\n\n\n Instead of answering, Paula suddenly stood up.  \u201cLet\u2019s go see how they\u2019re coming with the actors,\u201d she  said. \u201cI think they\u2019re almost finished.\u201d\n\n8\n\n Not wanting to press Paula further, and feeling  that perhaps she had asked too personal a question  on such short acquaintance, Peggy reluctantly stood  too, and joined Paula to watch the last of what she  now could only think of as the livestock show.\n\n\n As she drew closer to the table, she heard Mal saying,  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Lang, but you\u2019re just not  the right type for the role. Perhaps some other....\u201d  and his voice trailed off in embarrassment.\n\n\n Lang, a short, thin, unhappy young man, answered  almost tearfully, \u201cBut, Mr. Seton, looks aren\u2019t everything.  I\u2019m really a funny comedian. Honestly! If you  would only give me a chance to read for you, I know  that I could make you change your mind about the  way this character should look!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that you could,\u201d Mal said gently,  \u201cbut if you did, the play would suffer. I\u2019m afraid the  comedian we need for this must be a large, rather  bluff-looking person, like these three gentlemen  whom I have chosen to hear. The part calls for it.  I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n Mr. Lang nodded sadly, mumbled, \u201cI understand,\u201d  and walked off, his head hanging and his  hands thrust deep in his pockets, looking less like a  comedian than any man in the world. Peggy  watched him go, not knowing whether to feel sorrier  for him or for Mal.\n\n\n \u201cAll right, gentlemen,\u201d Mal called out. \u201cThat takes  care of the male roles. All of you who are left will be  given copies of the play to study, marked at the passages  I want to hear. Be sure to read the whole play  carefully, so that you understand the workings of the  characters you have been selected to read. You have  three days to look it over. We\u2019ll meet at ten o\u2019clock  on Saturday morning at the Penthouse Theater to  hear you. Thank you. And now for the ladies.\u201d\n\n9\n\n The men left, after being given their scripts, and  though they chatted amiably with one another,  Peggy was sure that each was casting rather hostile  looks toward others who were trying for the same  parts. Keeping friendships in the theater was not an  easy thing, she thought, particularly for people of  similar physical types!\n\n\n Mal\u2019s first concern in reviewing the actresses was,  of course, for the leading role. And, of course, it was  for this role that he had the most applicants. More  than twenty girls came forward when the announcement  was made, and Peggy thought that she had  never seen so many striking and beautiful faces and  figures. It was not going to be easy for Mal to make a  choice. As Paula, her new friend, went forward to  join the others, Peggy whispered a word of encouragement,  then stood to one side to watch.\n\n\n Mal went down the line, regretfully dismissing one  after the other of the girls, and occasionally asking  one to step aside to try for another role. His tough-looking  expression hardly varied as he spoke to each  one, but Peggy thought she saw the ghost of a smile  cross his face when he spoke to Paula Andrews. Another  review of the remaining girls eliminated a few  more. Finally, there were only four left, Paula  among them. Mal thanked them, distributed scripts,  and asked them to be at the Penthouse Theater on  Saturday at noon.\n\n\n Paula returned to Peggy with eyes shining. \u201cOh,  Peggy! I think you were right! I just know I\u2019m going  to get the part! I know it!\u201d\n\n10\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t count too much on it,\u201d Peggy cautioned,  \u201cor you may be too bitterly disappointed if you don\u2019t  get it. But,\u201d she added, enthusiastically violating her  own rule of caution, \u201cI\u2019m sure, too! I\u2019ll see you Saturday.  Even if I don\u2019t get a script, I\u2019ll be there just to  hear you read!\u201d\n\n\n Then, with a smile of farewell, Peggy turned her  attention to the \u201ccareer woman, early thirties\u201d classification  that Mal had called for next. Once that  was out of the way, she knew it would be her turn.\n\n\n This time, there were not so many applicants and  Peggy remembered Randy telling her that this  would be one of their most difficult roles to cast.  Only four actresses came forward, and Mal, with  difficulty, reviewed them all. Unable to eliminate by  type, he gave them all scripts and asked them to  come to the theater. Then he called for \u201ccharacter  ing\u00e9nues\u201d and Peggy joined seven other girls in the  \u201clivestock show.\u201d\n\n\n Mal reviewed them carefully, managing to look at  Peggy with complete lack of recognition. He gently  eliminated three of them on the basis of hair coloring,  height or general type. Another, curiously  enough, was eliminated, like Amy, for a Southern accent,  and a fifth, also like Amy, was too beautiful.  \u201cThe part calls for a pretty girl,\u201d Mal said with a rare  smile, \u201cbut not for a girl so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate  the stage! It was a pleasure to look at you, but I\u2019m  afraid you\u2019re not quite right for the part.\u201d\n\n\n When he was done, Peggy and two others were  given scripts and told to come to the theater on Saturday.  Feeling lightheaded and giddy, Peggy settled  herself on one of the folding chairs that lined  the back wall, and waited for Mal, Randy, and Amy  to finish so she could join them for coffee.\n\n11\n\n Scarcely noticing the rest of the proceedings, she  thought only about the coming readings. She was  so familiar with the play that she knew she had an  advantage, perhaps unfairly, over the other two girls.  She had watched the script grow from its first rough  draft to the finished text now in her hands, and had  discussed it with Randy through each revision. She  knew she could play the part; in fact, she suspected  secretly that Randy had written it for her, and the  thought made her blush. Still, it would not be easy,  she knew. Mal\u2019s sense of fairness and his absolute  devotion to the play above everything else would  keep him from making up his mind in advance.\n\n\n But despite this knowledge, she could not help  looking ahead\u2014all the way ahead\u2014to the restless  stir of the opening-night audience out front, the last-minute  preparations backstage, the bright, hot lights  and the smell of make-up and scenery paint as she  waited to go on in Act One, Scene One of Come  Closer , Randy Brewster\u2019s brilliant new play in which  Peggy Lane would be discovered!\n\n12 II\n\n The Hopefuls The audience consisted of a handful of actors and  actresses, and Randy Brewster and Mallory Seton.  The stage lighting was a cold splash produced by two  floodlights without color gels to soften them. The  scenery was the brick back wall of the stage, two  ladders, a table and two straight-backed chairs. Only  the front row of house lights was on, and the back of  the theater was dark, empty and gloomy, a shadowy  wasteland of empty rows of seats like tombstones.\n\n\n On the stage, a \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was reading  his lines. Peggy knew, after the first few words, that  he would not do. He had somehow completely  missed the character of the man he was portraying,  and was heavily overplaying. Mal, being perhaps  more patient than Peggy, listened and watched  with great care. Amy, who was acting as Mal\u2019s assistant  for the production, sat in a chair by the proscenium,  reading her script by the light of a small  lamp and feeding the actor cue lines. Mal followed  the whole sequence with no visible sign of impatience  and, when the actor was through, said,  \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you know our decision in a day  or two.\u201d\n\n13\n\n The next \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was better, but still  not quite on target, Peggy thought. He seemed to be  playing the part for laughs, and although there were  some comic values to be extracted from the role, it  was really far more a straight dramatic character.  Still, he was clearly a better actor than the first,  and with direction might do well.\n\n\n Following his reading, Mal again repeated his  polite, invariable formula, \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you  know our decision in a day or two,\u201d and called for  the next reading.\n\n\n Peggy watched the remaining actors try for the  role, and made mental notes of which ones were possible,  which probable, and which stood no chance at  all.\n\n\n The same process was then followed for the leading  men, and the same wide range of talent and understanding  of the part was displayed. Some seemed  to have no idea at all about the play or its meaning,  and Peggy was sure that these men had read only  the parts marked for them. Others had a clear understanding  of the kind of character they were playing,  and tried to create him in the brief time they had on  stage. Others still were actors who had one rather  inflexible way of playing, and used it for all kinds of  parts. Their performances were uniform imitations of  each other, and all were imitations of the early acting  style of Marlon Brando. They seemed to forget,  Peggy thought, that Brando\u2019s style developed  from the roles he had to play, and that as he got  other roles, he showed other facets of a rounded talent.  It made her angry that some actors thought  they could get ahead in a creative field by being  imitative.\n\n14\n\n Each actor, no matter how good or how bad, was  treated with impersonal courtesy by Mal, and each  left looking sure that the part was his. Peggy was  glad that she would not have to see their faces when  they learned that they had not been selected.\n\n\n \u201cThe pity of it,\u201d she whispered to Randy, \u201cisn\u2019t  that there are so many bad ones, but that there are  so many good ones, and that only one can be selected  for each role. I wish there were some way of telling  the good ones you can\u2019t take that they were really  good, but that you just couldn\u2019t take everyone!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou can\u2019t let yourself worry about that,\u201d Randy  replied. \u201cThe good ones know they\u2019re good, and  they\u2019re not going to be discouraged by the loss of a  role. And the bad ones think they\u2019re good, too, and  most of them have tremendous egos to protect  them from ever finding out\u2014or even thinking\u2014otherwise!\u201d\n\n\n The door at the back of the theater opened quietly,  and Peggy, turning around in her seat, saw a few of  the actresses entering. They quietly found seats in  the rear and settled down to await their turn.\n\n\n \u201cI think I\u2019ll go back there with the girls,\u201d Peggy  whispered. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a girl I met at the casting  call, and I\u2019d like to chat with her for a few minutes  when she comes. Do you mind if I don\u2019t look at all  this?\u201d\n\n\n Randy grinned. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019d get out of here,  too, if I could without getting Mal mad at me. This  kind of thing always breaks my heart, too!\u201d\n\n15\n\n As she went up the aisle as unobtrusively as possible,  Peggy glanced at the actresses who had just  come in. She recognized a few of their faces from  the casting call of three days ago, but did not see her  new friend among them. She decided to go out to the  lobby to wait for her there. A new group of girls  entered the theater as Peggy was leaving and, as she  passed, one reached out and grabbed her arm.\n\n\n Peggy turned in surprise to find herself greeted  with a broad grin and a quick companionable kiss.\n\n\n \u201cGreta!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cCome on out to the lobby, and I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Greta  Larsen said, with a toss of her head that made her  thick blond braid spin around and settle over her  shoulder.\n\n\n \u201cBut I thought you were in New Haven, getting  ready to open Over the Hill ,\u201d Peggy said, when they  had reached the lobby. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing  here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t read your Variety very carefully,\u201d  Greta said. \u201c Over the Hill opened in New  Haven to such bad notices that the producer decided  to close out of town. At first we thought he\u2019d  call in a play doctor to try to fix things up, but he  finally decided, and very sensibly, that it would be  easier to just throw the whole thing out. I\u2019m afraid  he lost a lot of money, and he didn\u2019t have any more  left.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cAnd it was a real  chance for you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n16\n\n \u201cNot really,\u201d Greta said. \u201cThe part wasn\u2019t too  good, and I\u2019d just as soon not be in a disaster. Anyway,  it gave me a chance to work for a few weeks,  and an agent saw me and said he thought I was  good, so maybe I\u2019m not any the worse for the experience.\u201d\n\n\n At that moment, Peggy saw Paula Andrews enter  the lobby, and she motioned to her to join them.  \u201cGreta, this is Paula Andrews. She\u2019s reading for the  lead today, and I hope she gets it. Paula, I want you  to meet Greta Larsen, one of my housemates.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHousemates?\u201d Paula questioned, a little puzzled.\n\n\n \u201cYes. There are about a dozen of us, more or less.  We live in a place called the Gramercy Arms\u2014a  wonderful place\u2014and we live like one big noisy family.  The Arms is run just for young actresses, so we  all have a lot in common. I haven\u2019t seen Greta for  weeks\u2014she\u2019s been out of town with a play\u2014and I\u2019m  just getting over being stunned at seeing her now.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPeggy tactfully neglected to mention that the  play flopped,\u201d Greta laughed, \u201cand now I\u2019m back in  town without a job. In fact, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to read for Mal?\u201d Peggy  asked excitedly.\n\n\n \u201cUh-huh. I met him on the street an hour or so  ago, and he told me he had a part he thought I should  try out for, and that he was thinking of me for it all  along, but assumed that I wouldn\u2019t be available.  Well, you can\u2019t be more available than I am, so here  I am!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHave you read the play?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m lucky there,\u201d Greta replied. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it  in three different drafts since it started. Peggy\u2019s  friendly with Randy Brewster, the boy who wrote it,  and each time she brought a draft home, I got to  read it. So I\u2019m not at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\n17\n\n \u201cWhat do you think of Come Closer , Paula?\u201d asked  Peggy.\n\n\n \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful! I hope more than ever that  I get the part! Do you really think I have a chance?\u201d\n\n\n Greta nodded decisively. \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re  made for it,\u201d she said.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s just what Peggy said!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy stole a glance through the doors to the theater.  \u201cI think we\u2019re about ready to find out whether or  not you can act,\u201d she said. \u201cThey seem to be about  through with the actors, and that means you\u2019re on  next!\u201d\n\n\n Wishing each other good luck, they entered the  darkened part of the house and prepared for what  Peggy could only think of as their ordeal. Afterward, as Peggy, Amy, Paula, and Greta sat at  a table in a nearby coffeehouse waiting for Mal and  Randy to join them, each was sure that she had been  terrible.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no!\u201d Peggy said. \u201cYou two were just marvelous!  But I couldn\u2019t have been worse. I know I read  the part wrong. I thought I had the character clear in  my mind, but I\u2019m sure that the way it came out was a  mile off!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou have a lot more talent than judgment,\u201d Greta  said mournfully. \u201cYou were perfect. And so was  Paula. As for me....\u201d Her voice trailed off in despair.\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can say that, Greta,\u201d Paula  put in. \u201cI know you were the best in your part, and  nobody even came close to Peggy. But I\u2019ve never  felt so off in my life as I did reading that part. It\u2019s a  wonder any of you even want to be seen with me!\u201d\n\n18\n\n Only when Amy started to laugh did the three  others realize how much alike they had sounded.  Then they joined in the laughter and couldn\u2019t seem  to stop. When they seemed at the point of dissolving  helplessly into a permanent attack of the giggles,  Randy and Mal joined them.\n\n\n \u201cIf you\u2019re laughing at the play,\u201d Randy said  gloomily, \u201cI can hardly blame you. You never know  just how badly you\u2019ve written until someone gets up  and starts to read your lines.\u201d\n\n\n All at the same time, the girls started to reassure  him and tell him how good the play was, and how  badly the actors, including themselves, had handled  the lines, but this was so much like their last exchange  of conversation that once more they broke up  in helpless laughter.\n\n\n When they got their breath back, and when coffee  and pastry had been ordered, they tried to explain  the cause of their hilarity to the boys.\n\n\n \u201c... so, you see,\u201d Peggy concluded, \u201cwe were  each explaining how good the others were and how  bad we were, and when Randy started telling us how  bad he had been as a writer, we just couldn\u2019t stand  it!\u201d\n\n\n It was Mal who got them back to sane ground.  With his tough face, like a movie gangster\u2019s or private  detective\u2019s, and his gentle, cultured English voice and  assured manner, he calmly gave his opinion of the  afternoon\u2019s auditions. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the story teach the reader about their process of casting?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Acting ability is most important before looks\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Acting ability is most important before looks\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Acting ability is most important before looks\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

This affirms look\u2019s primacy: they never test rejects; they seek more of the required type until an actor appears who also \u201ccan act.\u201d They do not revisit rejects of wrong type.  \n\n3.2 Readings Are Secondary Fine-Tuning  \nDebater_B overstates the importance of readings: readings occur \u201conly after\u201d type selection (pars. 9, 12\u201314). Among the correct-type pool, acting differentiates, but the pool itself is restricted strictly by look.

This is why type trumps raw talent: the audience must believe each character at first sight.  \n\n3.4 Greta\u2019s \u201cOver the Hill\u201d Failure Confirms Type Dependence  \nDebater_B points to Greta\u2019s prior work and agent interest as evidence that acting might suffice. Yet she only wins when she \u201cre-auditions\u201d under the play\u2019s visual requirements (pars. 16\u201317). Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 does not carry weight without matching type.  \n\n4.

I can\u2019t help feeling  sorry for them\u2014for all of us, I mean. After all, I\u2019m  trying for a part, too.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy\u2019s friend and housemate, Amy Preston,  smiled in agreement and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy business,  honey, is it? But the ones I feel sorriest for  right now are Mal and Randy. After all, they have  the unpleasant job of choosing and refusing, and a  lot of these folks are their friends. I wouldn\u2019t want  to be in their shoes.\u201d\n\n2\n\n Peggy nodded thoughtfully, and reflected that it  must, indeed, be more wearing on the boys. Mallory  Seton, director of the new play, had been an upper-class  student at the Academy when Peggy had  started there, and he was a good friend of hers. She  had worked with him before, as a general assistant,  when they had discovered a theater. It would not be  easy for him to consider Peggy for an acting role, and  to do so completely without bias. It would not be a  question of playing favorites, Peggy knew, but quite  the reverse. Mal\u2019s sense of fair play would make him  bend over backward to keep from giving favors to  his friends. If she was to get a role in this new production,  she would really have to work for it.\n\n\n And if it was difficult for Mal, she thought, it was  more so for Randy Brewster, the author of the play,  for her friendship with him was of a different sort  than with Mal. Mal was just a friend\u2014a good one,  to be sure\u2014but with Randy Brewster, somehow,  things were different. There was nothing \u201cserious,\u201d  she assured herself, but they had gone on dates together  with a regularity that was a little more than  casual and, whatever his feelings were for her, she  was sure that they were more complicated than  Mal\u2019s.\n\n\n \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll ever get through all these  people?\u201d Amy asked, interrupting her thoughts.  \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors read for  them in just one afternoon?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, they won\u2019t be doing readings today,\u201d Peggy  replied, glad to turn her attention from what was becoming  a difficult subject for thought. \u201cThis is just a  first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people  for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones, send  the impossible ones away, and then go into elimination  readings later.\u201d\n\n3\n\n \u201cBut what if the people they pick for looks can\u2019t  act?\u201d Amy asked. \u201cAnd what if some of the rejects  are wonderful actors?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects,\u201d Peggy explained,  \u201cbecause they both have a pretty good idea  of what the characters in the play should look like.  And if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors,  then they hold another cast call and try again.  Mal says that sometimes certain parts are so hard to  cast that they have to go through a dozen calls just  to find one actor.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt seems kind of unfair, doesn\u2019t it, to be eliminated  just because you\u2019re not the right physical  type,\u201d Amy said, \u201cbut I can understand it. They have  to start somewhere, and I guess that\u2019s as good a place  as any.\u201d Then she smiled and added, \u201cI guess I\u2019m  just feeling sorry for myself, because Mal told me  there was no sense in my trying out at all, because I  didn\u2019t look or sound right for any part in the play. If  I don\u2019t get rid of this Southern accent of mine, I  may never get a part at all, except in a Tennessee  Williams play!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded sympathetically. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just  your accent, Amy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s your looks, too. At  least for this play. Mal and Randy told you that  you\u2019re just too pretty for any of the parts that fit  your age, and that\u2019s nothing to feel bad about. If  anybody ought to feel insulted, it\u2019s me, because  they asked me to try out!\u201d\n\n4\n\n \u201cOh, they were just sweet-talking me,\u201d Amy replied.  \u201cAnd as for you, you know you don\u2019t have to  worry about your looks. You have a wonderful face!  You can look beautiful, or comic, or pathetic, or  cute or anything. I\u2019m stuck with just being a South\u2019n  Belle, blond and helpless, po\u2019 li\u2019l ol\u2019 me, lookin\u2019 sad  and sweet through those ol\u2019 magnolia blossoms!\u201d  She broadened her slight, soft accent until it sounded  like something you could spread on hot cornbread,  and both girls broke into laughter that sounded odd  in the strained atmosphere of the bare rehearsal  studio.\n\n\n It was at this point that Mal and Randy came in,  with pleasant, if somewhat brisk, nods to the assembled  actors and actresses, and a special smile for  Amy and Peggy. In a businesslike manner, they settled  themselves at a table near the windows, spread  out scripts and pads and pencils, and prepared for  the chore that faced them. Amy, who was there to  help the boys by acting as secretary for the occasion,  wished Peggy good luck, and joined the boys at the  table. Her job was to take names and addresses, and  to jot down any facts about each actor that Randy  and Mal wanted to be sure to remember.\n\n\n Mal started the proceedings by introducing himself  and Randy. Then, estimating the crowd, he said,  \u201cSince there are fewer men here, and also fewer male  roles to cast, we\u2019re going to do them first. I hope that  you ladies won\u2019t mind. We won\u2019t keep you waiting  long, but if we worked with you first, we\u2019d have these  gentlemen waiting most of the day. Shall we get  started?\u201d After a brief glance at his notes, he called  out, \u201cFirst, I\u2019d like to see businessman types, young  forties. How many have we?\u201d\n\n5\n\n Four men separated themselves from the crowd  and approached the table. Peggy watched with interest  as Mal and Randy looked them over, murmured  to Amy to take notes, and asked questions.  After a few minutes, the men left, two of them looking  happy, two resigned. Then Mal stood and called  for leading man types, late twenties or early thirties,  tall and athletic. As six tall, athletic, handsome  young men came forward, Peggy felt that she just  couldn\u2019t stand watching the casting interviews any  longer. It reminded her too much of the livestock  shows she had attended as a youngster in her home  town of Rockport, Wisconsin. Necessary though it  was, she felt it was hardly a way to have to deal  with human beings.\n\n\n Slipping back through the crowd of waiting actors,  she joined the actresses in the rear of the room, and  found an empty seat next to a young girl.\n\n\n \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, can\u2019t you watch  it either?\u201d\n\n\n The girl smiled in understanding. \u201cIt always upsets  me,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut it\u2019s something we simply  have to learn to live with. At least until we get well-known,  or get agents to do this sort of thing for us.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt sounds as if you\u2019ve been in a few of these before,\u201d  Peggy said.\n\n\n \u201cI have. But not here in the East,\u201d the girl replied.  \u201cI\u2019m from California, and I\u2019ve been in a few little-theater  things there, but nobody seems to pay much  attention to them. I heard that off-Broadway theater  in New York attracts a lot of critics, and I thought  that I\u2019d do better here. Have you had any luck?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m just beginning,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cI\u2019m still  studying at the New York Dramatic Academy. I hope  I can get some kind of supporting role in this play,  but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for anything big yet. By  the way, my name is Peggy Lane. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\n6\n\n \u201cI\u2019m Paula Andrews,\u201d the girl answered, \u201cand  maybe I\u2019m shooting too high, but I\u2019m trying out for  the female lead. I hope I have a chance for it.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy looked carefully at her new friend, at the  somewhat uncertain smile that played about her  well-formed, generous mouth and the intelligence  that shone from her large, widely placed green eyes.  Her rather long face was saved from severity by a  soft halo of red-brown hair, the whole effect being an  appealing combination of strength and feminine softness.\n\n\n \u201cI think you do have a chance,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cIn  fact, if you can act, I bet you\u2019ll get the part. I\u2019ve read  the play, and I know the author and director, and  unless I\u2019m way off, you look just the way the lead  should look. In fact, it\u2019s almost uncanny. You look as  if you just walked out of the script!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I hope you\u2019re right!\u201d Paula said with animation.  \u201cAnd I hope you get a part, too. I have a feeling  that you\u2019re going to bring me good luck!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThe one who needs luck is me, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Peggy  said. \u201cBeing friendly with Randy and Mal isn\u2019t going  to help me in the least, and I\u2019m going to have to be  awfully good to get the part. And it\u2019s really important  to me, too, because I\u2019m getting near the end of  my trial year.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTrial year?\u201d Paula asked curiously.\n\n7\n\n \u201cUh-huh. My parents agreed to let me come to  New York to study acting and try for parts for a year,  and I agreed that if I didn\u2019t show signs of success  before the year was up, I\u2019d come home and go back  to college. I\u2019ve been here for eight months now, and  I haven\u2019t got anything to show my parents yet. The  part I\u2019m trying for now isn\u2019t a big one, but it\u2019s a good  supporting role, and what\u2019s more, we get paid. If I  can show my mother and father that I can earn some  money by acting, I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll let me go on  trying.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut do you expect to make enough to live on right  away?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no! I\u2019m not that na\u00efve! But when my year is  over at the Academy, I can always take a job as a  typist or a secretary somewhere, while I look for  parts. If you can type and take shorthand, you never  have to worry about making a living.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI wish that I could do those things,\u201d Paula said  wistfully. \u201cThe only way I\u2019ve been able to make ends  meet is by working in department stores as a salesgirl,  and that doesn\u2019t pay much. Besides, the work is  so unsteady.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMy parents are very practical people,\u201d Peggy said  with a smile, \u201cand they made sure that I learned  routine office skills before they would let me think  about other and more glamorous kinds of careers.  Daddy owns the newspaper in our small town in  Wisconsin, and I\u2019ve worked with him as a typist and  a reporter of sorts and as a proofreader, too. I\u2019ll always  be grateful that he made me learn all those  things. I don\u2019t think he has much faith in the acting  business, but he\u2019s been wonderful about giving me a  chance. What do your parents think of your wanting  to be an actress?\u201d\n\n\n Instead of answering, Paula suddenly stood up.  \u201cLet\u2019s go see how they\u2019re coming with the actors,\u201d she  said. \u201cI think they\u2019re almost finished.\u201d\n\n8\n\n Not wanting to press Paula further, and feeling  that perhaps she had asked too personal a question  on such short acquaintance, Peggy reluctantly stood  too, and joined Paula to watch the last of what she  now could only think of as the livestock show.\n\n\n As she drew closer to the table, she heard Mal saying,  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Lang, but you\u2019re just not  the right type for the role. Perhaps some other....\u201d  and his voice trailed off in embarrassment.\n\n\n Lang, a short, thin, unhappy young man, answered  almost tearfully, \u201cBut, Mr. Seton, looks aren\u2019t everything.  I\u2019m really a funny comedian. Honestly! If you  would only give me a chance to read for you, I know  that I could make you change your mind about the  way this character should look!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that you could,\u201d Mal said gently,  \u201cbut if you did, the play would suffer. I\u2019m afraid the  comedian we need for this must be a large, rather  bluff-looking person, like these three gentlemen  whom I have chosen to hear. The part calls for it.  I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n Mr. Lang nodded sadly, mumbled, \u201cI understand,\u201d  and walked off, his head hanging and his  hands thrust deep in his pockets, looking less like a  comedian than any man in the world. Peggy  watched him go, not knowing whether to feel sorrier  for him or for Mal.\n\n\n \u201cAll right, gentlemen,\u201d Mal called out. \u201cThat takes  care of the male roles. All of you who are left will be  given copies of the play to study, marked at the passages  I want to hear. Be sure to read the whole play  carefully, so that you understand the workings of the  characters you have been selected to read. You have  three days to look it over. We\u2019ll meet at ten o\u2019clock  on Saturday morning at the Penthouse Theater to  hear you. Thank you. And now for the ladies.\u201d\n\n9\n\n The men left, after being given their scripts, and  though they chatted amiably with one another,  Peggy was sure that each was casting rather hostile  looks toward others who were trying for the same  parts. Keeping friendships in the theater was not an  easy thing, she thought, particularly for people of  similar physical types!\n\n\n Mal\u2019s first concern in reviewing the actresses was,  of course, for the leading role. And, of course, it was  for this role that he had the most applicants. More  than twenty girls came forward when the announcement  was made, and Peggy thought that she had  never seen so many striking and beautiful faces and  figures. It was not going to be easy for Mal to make a  choice. As Paula, her new friend, went forward to  join the others, Peggy whispered a word of encouragement,  then stood to one side to watch.\n\n\n Mal went down the line, regretfully dismissing one  after the other of the girls, and occasionally asking  one to step aside to try for another role. His tough-looking  expression hardly varied as he spoke to each  one, but Peggy thought she saw the ghost of a smile  cross his face when he spoke to Paula Andrews. Another  review of the remaining girls eliminated a few  more. Finally, there were only four left, Paula  among them. Mal thanked them, distributed scripts,  and asked them to be at the Penthouse Theater on  Saturday at noon.\n\n\n Paula returned to Peggy with eyes shining. \u201cOh,  Peggy! I think you were right! I just know I\u2019m going  to get the part! I know it!\u201d\n\n10\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t count too much on it,\u201d Peggy cautioned,  \u201cor you may be too bitterly disappointed if you don\u2019t  get it. But,\u201d she added, enthusiastically violating her  own rule of caution, \u201cI\u2019m sure, too! I\u2019ll see you Saturday.  Even if I don\u2019t get a script, I\u2019ll be there just to  hear you read!\u201d\n\n\n Then, with a smile of farewell, Peggy turned her  attention to the \u201ccareer woman, early thirties\u201d classification  that Mal had called for next. Once that  was out of the way, she knew it would be her turn.\n\n\n This time, there were not so many applicants and  Peggy remembered Randy telling her that this  would be one of their most difficult roles to cast.  Only four actresses came forward, and Mal, with  difficulty, reviewed them all. Unable to eliminate by  type, he gave them all scripts and asked them to  come to the theater. Then he called for \u201ccharacter  ing\u00e9nues\u201d and Peggy joined seven other girls in the  \u201clivestock show.\u201d\n\n\n Mal reviewed them carefully, managing to look at  Peggy with complete lack of recognition. He gently  eliminated three of them on the basis of hair coloring,  height or general type. Another, curiously  enough, was eliminated, like Amy, for a Southern accent,  and a fifth, also like Amy, was too beautiful.  \u201cThe part calls for a pretty girl,\u201d Mal said with a rare  smile, \u201cbut not for a girl so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate  the stage! It was a pleasure to look at you, but I\u2019m  afraid you\u2019re not quite right for the part.\u201d\n\n\n When he was done, Peggy and two others were  given scripts and told to come to the theater on Saturday.  Feeling lightheaded and giddy, Peggy settled  herself on one of the folding chairs that lined  the back wall, and waited for Mal, Randy, and Amy  to finish so she could join them for coffee.\n\n11\n\n Scarcely noticing the rest of the proceedings, she  thought only about the coming readings. She was  so familiar with the play that she knew she had an  advantage, perhaps unfairly, over the other two girls.  She had watched the script grow from its first rough  draft to the finished text now in her hands, and had  discussed it with Randy through each revision. She  knew she could play the part; in fact, she suspected  secretly that Randy had written it for her, and the  thought made her blush. Still, it would not be easy,  she knew. Mal\u2019s sense of fairness and his absolute  devotion to the play above everything else would  keep him from making up his mind in advance.\n\n\n But despite this knowledge, she could not help  looking ahead\u2014all the way ahead\u2014to the restless  stir of the opening-night audience out front, the last-minute  preparations backstage, the bright, hot lights  and the smell of make-up and scenery paint as she  waited to go on in Act One, Scene One of Come  Closer , Randy Brewster\u2019s brilliant new play in which  Peggy Lane would be discovered!\n\n12 II\n\n The Hopefuls The audience consisted of a handful of actors and  actresses, and Randy Brewster and Mallory Seton.  The stage lighting was a cold splash produced by two  floodlights without color gels to soften them. The  scenery was the brick back wall of the stage, two  ladders, a table and two straight-backed chairs. Only  the front row of house lights was on, and the back of  the theater was dark, empty and gloomy, a shadowy  wasteland of empty rows of seats like tombstones.\n\n\n On the stage, a \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was reading  his lines. Peggy knew, after the first few words, that  he would not do. He had somehow completely  missed the character of the man he was portraying,  and was heavily overplaying. Mal, being perhaps  more patient than Peggy, listened and watched  with great care. Amy, who was acting as Mal\u2019s assistant  for the production, sat in a chair by the proscenium,  reading her script by the light of a small  lamp and feeding the actor cue lines. Mal followed  the whole sequence with no visible sign of impatience  and, when the actor was through, said,  \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you know our decision in a day  or two.\u201d\n\n13\n\n The next \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was better, but still  not quite on target, Peggy thought. He seemed to be  playing the part for laughs, and although there were  some comic values to be extracted from the role, it  was really far more a straight dramatic character.  Still, he was clearly a better actor than the first,  and with direction might do well.\n\n\n Following his reading, Mal again repeated his  polite, invariable formula, \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you  know our decision in a day or two,\u201d and called for  the next reading.\n\n\n Peggy watched the remaining actors try for the  role, and made mental notes of which ones were possible,  which probable, and which stood no chance at  all.\n\n\n The same process was then followed for the leading  men, and the same wide range of talent and understanding  of the part was displayed. Some seemed  to have no idea at all about the play or its meaning,  and Peggy was sure that these men had read only  the parts marked for them. Others had a clear understanding  of the kind of character they were playing,  and tried to create him in the brief time they had on  stage. Others still were actors who had one rather  inflexible way of playing, and used it for all kinds of  parts. Their performances were uniform imitations of  each other, and all were imitations of the early acting  style of Marlon Brando. They seemed to forget,  Peggy thought, that Brando\u2019s style developed  from the roles he had to play, and that as he got  other roles, he showed other facets of a rounded talent.  It made her angry that some actors thought  they could get ahead in a creative field by being  imitative.\n\n14\n\n Each actor, no matter how good or how bad, was  treated with impersonal courtesy by Mal, and each  left looking sure that the part was his. Peggy was  glad that she would not have to see their faces when  they learned that they had not been selected.\n\n\n \u201cThe pity of it,\u201d she whispered to Randy, \u201cisn\u2019t  that there are so many bad ones, but that there are  so many good ones, and that only one can be selected  for each role. I wish there were some way of telling  the good ones you can\u2019t take that they were really  good, but that you just couldn\u2019t take everyone!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou can\u2019t let yourself worry about that,\u201d Randy  replied. \u201cThe good ones know they\u2019re good, and  they\u2019re not going to be discouraged by the loss of a  role. And the bad ones think they\u2019re good, too, and  most of them have tremendous egos to protect  them from ever finding out\u2014or even thinking\u2014otherwise!\u201d\n\n\n The door at the back of the theater opened quietly,  and Peggy, turning around in her seat, saw a few of  the actresses entering. They quietly found seats in  the rear and settled down to await their turn.\n\n\n \u201cI think I\u2019ll go back there with the girls,\u201d Peggy  whispered. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a girl I met at the casting  call, and I\u2019d like to chat with her for a few minutes  when she comes. Do you mind if I don\u2019t look at all  this?\u201d\n\n\n Randy grinned. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019d get out of here,  too, if I could without getting Mal mad at me. This  kind of thing always breaks my heart, too!\u201d\n\n15\n\n As she went up the aisle as unobtrusively as possible,  Peggy glanced at the actresses who had just  come in. She recognized a few of their faces from  the casting call of three days ago, but did not see her  new friend among them. She decided to go out to the  lobby to wait for her there. A new group of girls  entered the theater as Peggy was leaving and, as she  passed, one reached out and grabbed her arm.\n\n\n Peggy turned in surprise to find herself greeted  with a broad grin and a quick companionable kiss.\n\n\n \u201cGreta!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cCome on out to the lobby, and I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Greta  Larsen said, with a toss of her head that made her  thick blond braid spin around and settle over her  shoulder.\n\n\n \u201cBut I thought you were in New Haven, getting  ready to open Over the Hill ,\u201d Peggy said, when they  had reached the lobby. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing  here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t read your Variety very carefully,\u201d  Greta said. \u201c Over the Hill opened in New  Haven to such bad notices that the producer decided  to close out of town. At first we thought he\u2019d  call in a play doctor to try to fix things up, but he  finally decided, and very sensibly, that it would be  easier to just throw the whole thing out. I\u2019m afraid  he lost a lot of money, and he didn\u2019t have any more  left.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cAnd it was a real  chance for you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n16\n\n \u201cNot really,\u201d Greta said. \u201cThe part wasn\u2019t too  good, and I\u2019d just as soon not be in a disaster. Anyway,  it gave me a chance to work for a few weeks,  and an agent saw me and said he thought I was  good, so maybe I\u2019m not any the worse for the experience.\u201d\n\n\n At that moment, Peggy saw Paula Andrews enter  the lobby, and she motioned to her to join them.  \u201cGreta, this is Paula Andrews. She\u2019s reading for the  lead today, and I hope she gets it. Paula, I want you  to meet Greta Larsen, one of my housemates.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHousemates?\u201d Paula questioned, a little puzzled.\n\n\n \u201cYes. There are about a dozen of us, more or less.  We live in a place called the Gramercy Arms\u2014a  wonderful place\u2014and we live like one big noisy family.  The Arms is run just for young actresses, so we  all have a lot in common. I haven\u2019t seen Greta for  weeks\u2014she\u2019s been out of town with a play\u2014and I\u2019m  just getting over being stunned at seeing her now.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPeggy tactfully neglected to mention that the  play flopped,\u201d Greta laughed, \u201cand now I\u2019m back in  town without a job. In fact, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to read for Mal?\u201d Peggy  asked excitedly.\n\n\n \u201cUh-huh. I met him on the street an hour or so  ago, and he told me he had a part he thought I should  try out for, and that he was thinking of me for it all  along, but assumed that I wouldn\u2019t be available.  Well, you can\u2019t be more available than I am, so here  I am!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHave you read the play?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m lucky there,\u201d Greta replied. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it  in three different drafts since it started. Peggy\u2019s  friendly with Randy Brewster, the boy who wrote it,  and each time she brought a draft home, I got to  read it. So I\u2019m not at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\n17\n\n \u201cWhat do you think of Come Closer , Paula?\u201d asked  Peggy.\n\n\n \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful! I hope more than ever that  I get the part! Do you really think I have a chance?\u201d\n\n\n Greta nodded decisively. \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re  made for it,\u201d she said.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s just what Peggy said!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy stole a glance through the doors to the theater.  \u201cI think we\u2019re about ready to find out whether or  not you can act,\u201d she said. \u201cThey seem to be about  through with the actors, and that means you\u2019re on  next!\u201d\n\n\n Wishing each other good luck, they entered the  darkened part of the house and prepared for what  Peggy could only think of as their ordeal. Afterward, as Peggy, Amy, Paula, and Greta sat at  a table in a nearby coffeehouse waiting for Mal and  Randy to join them, each was sure that she had been  terrible.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no!\u201d Peggy said. \u201cYou two were just marvelous!  But I couldn\u2019t have been worse. I know I read  the part wrong. I thought I had the character clear in  my mind, but I\u2019m sure that the way it came out was a  mile off!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou have a lot more talent than judgment,\u201d Greta  said mournfully. \u201cYou were perfect. And so was  Paula. As for me....\u201d Her voice trailed off in despair.\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can say that, Greta,\u201d Paula  put in. \u201cI know you were the best in your part, and  nobody even came close to Peggy. But I\u2019ve never  felt so off in my life as I did reading that part. It\u2019s a  wonder any of you even want to be seen with me!\u201d\n\n18\n\n Only when Amy started to laugh did the three  others realize how much alike they had sounded.  Then they joined in the laughter and couldn\u2019t seem  to stop. When they seemed at the point of dissolving  helplessly into a permanent attack of the giggles,  Randy and Mal joined them.\n\n\n \u201cIf you\u2019re laughing at the play,\u201d Randy said  gloomily, \u201cI can hardly blame you. You never know  just how badly you\u2019ve written until someone gets up  and starts to read your lines.\u201d\n\n\n All at the same time, the girls started to reassure  him and tell him how good the play was, and how  badly the actors, including themselves, had handled  the lines, but this was so much like their last exchange  of conversation that once more they broke up  in helpless laughter.\n\n\n When they got their breath back, and when coffee  and pastry had been ordered, they tried to explain  the cause of their hilarity to the boys.\n\n\n \u201c... so, you see,\u201d Peggy concluded, \u201cwe were  each explaining how good the others were and how  bad we were, and when Randy started telling us how  bad he had been as a writer, we just couldn\u2019t stand  it!\u201d\n\n\n It was Mal who got them back to sane ground.  With his tough face, like a movie gangster\u2019s or private  detective\u2019s, and his gentle, cultured English voice and  assured manner, he calmly gave his opinion of the  afternoon\u2019s auditions. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the story teach the reader about their process of casting?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Acting ability is most important before looks\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \nI contend that \u201cPeggy Plays Off-Broadway\u201d teaches that physical type (\u201clook\u201d) is the primary criterion in casting, and that acting ability is considered only as a secondary screen among those of the correct type.\n\n2. Core Evidence  \n2.1 Initial Screen by Type  \n\u2022 <quote>\u201cThis is just a first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones, send the impossible ones away, and then go into elimination readings later\u201d</quote> (par. 2).  \n\u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects \u2026 if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d</invalid_quote> (par. 3).  \n\u21d2 The directors never revisit actors eliminated on looks, regardless of acting skill.\n\n2.2 Eliminations Despite Acting Skill  \n\u2022 Mr. Lang, \u201creally a funny comedian,\u201d begs to read, but Mal refuses: <quote>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that you could,\u201d Mal said gently, \u201cbut if you did, the play would suffer. I\u2019m afraid the comedian we need for this must be</quote> (par. 8).  \n\u21d2 Acting ability is powerless against wrong physique.\n\n\u2022 Amy Preston, capable actress, is eliminated on both accent and being \u201ctoo pretty\u201d: <invalid_quote>\u201cThe part calls for a pretty girl \u2026 but not for a girl so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate\u201d</invalid_quote> (par. 10).  \n\u21d2 Even flexible criteria subordinate acting to \u201clook.\u201d\n\n2.3 Casting Friends Only After Type-Filtering  \n\u2022 Peggy and Greta, despite familiarity with the play and presumed superior acting insight, must still pass the type filter before readings (pars. 11\u201314).  \n\u2022 Greta\u2019s out-of-town experience and Paula\u2019s strong reading do not override their initial acceptance based on appearance (pars. 17\u201319).  \n\u21d2 Acting merit matters only after type.\n\n2.4 Practical Industry Testimony  \n\u2022 Mal repeatedly reassures: <quote>\u201cThe good ones know they\u2019re good, and they\u2019re not going to be discouraged by the loss of a</quote> (par. 14).  \n\u21d2 Industry norm accepts that many good actors will be rejected on physical grounds.\n\n3. Attacks on Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n3.1 Misinterpreting Subsequent Readings  \nB argues acting is most important based on the \u201cProbationary\u201d readings (parts 12\u201314). But these occur only after rigorous type screening, thus among a self-selected pool of \u201clook\u201d matches. Measured abilities there only fine-tune choices, not invert the priority.\n\n3.2 Ignoring \u201cNo Second Chances\u201d Rule  \nB fails to explain why the directors \u201cwon\u2019t go back to rejects\u201d if acting were primary. If skill were paramount, they would audition all promising actors irrespective of appearance. They explicitly do the opposite.\n\n3.3 Overstating Actors\u2019 Ego Resilience  \nB suggests rejected \u201cgood\u201d actors are undeterred (par. 14). This is mere consolation, not evidence they\u2019re valued. The pity Randy expresses over hard-hearted process underscores that good actors suffer for being wrong type.\n\n3.4 Practical Continuity  \nPeggy\u2019s parents advise her to master typing/shorthand to bail out if acting fails (par. 7). If ability alone drove casting, the \u201clook\u201d hurdle would vanish over time as Peggy builds r\u00e9sum\u00e9; yet she must still chase type-specific roles via repeated cast calls (par. 3). Look remains gatekeeper.\n\n4. Conclusion  \nEvery stage of casting strictly enforces a physical \u201ctype\u201d filter before any acting evaluation. The story\u2019s repeated insistence on \u201cfirst pick by type,\u201d the permanent rejection of mis-typed yet talented actors, and the directors\u2019 unwillingness to \u201cundo\u201d type choices incontrovertibly teach that \u201clook\u201d is the most important factor and acting ability a secondary, subsequent concern.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArguments for \u201cActing Ability Is Most Important Before Looks\u201d (Debater_B)\n\nI. Casting Process Requires Both, But Ultimately Acting Decides  \n 1. Initial \u201cType\u201d Call Is Only Preliminary Selection  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThis is just a first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people for type. \u2026 And if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 2, 3).  \n     \u2013 They reject look\u2010matches who cannot act and reopen casting.  \n   \u2022 Even after selecting for \u201ctype,\u201d they schedule elimination readings \u201cto hear you\u201d (para. 9). Only through readings can one \u201cunderstand the workings of the characters.\u201d  \n 2. Elimination Readings Determine the Final Cast  \n   \u2022 Mal and Randy listen patiently to each reading despite \u201cwide range of talent.\u201d They must \u201clet you know our decision\u201d only after seeing each actor\u2019s performance (para. 12\u201314).  \n   \u2022 Actors wrong for the part physically but strong in acting (e.g., imitative Brando style) are remarked on but still evaluated for possible direction.  \n\nII. Repeated Calls Show Acting Trumps Look  \n 1. Example of Mr. Lang (para. 8\u20139)  \n   \u2022 <quote>\u201cBut, Mr. Seton, looks aren\u2019t everything.  I\u2019m really a funny comedian. Honestly! If you  would only give me a chance to read for you, I know  that I could make you change your mind a</quote>  \n   \u2022 Mal\u2019s response: <quote>I\u2019m afraid the comedian we need for this must be a large, rather bluff-looking person,</quote>  \n   \u2013 Even though Lang \u201creally\u201d can act, his look disqualifies him because his acting can\u2019t override look for that role. That exception actually confirms look matters only when required by character, not universally. If he had truly unmatched talent for an unrestricted role, they\u2019d consider it.  \n 2. Greta Larsen\u2019s Failed \u201cOver the Hill\u201d vs. Success Through New Audition (para. 16\u201317)  \n   \u2022 Greta\u2019s prior experience didn\u2019t secure her role until she auditioned again under proper look\u2010and\u2010acting combination.  \n\nIII. Audience of Director and Playwright Values Acting  \n 1. Mal\u2019s Sense of Fairness and \u201cAbsolute Devotion to the Play\u201d (para. 11)  \n   \u2022 Peggy trusts Mal \u201cwould keep him from making up his mind in advance.\u201d He will not favor friends; instead, he judges by performance.  \n 2. The Girls\u2019 Laughter and Self\u2010Criticism (para. 18)  \n   \u2022 Despite excellent looks, each woman fears her own readings were \u201cterrible\u201d and acknowledges ability matters.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_A (\u201cLook Most Important\u201d)  \n 1. Misreads \u201cFirst Cast Call\u201d as Final Decision  \n   \u2022 Debater_A wrongly equates preliminary type\u2010matching with casting. Rejection notices and subsequent readings demonstrate process is not complete until acting is heard.  \n 2. Ignores \u201cIf Not Good Enough, Then ... Another Cast Call\u201d  \n   \u2022 A admits that poor actors who match \u201ctype\u201d are dropped and new calls held (para. 3). If look were supreme, producers would keep miscasts until successful financially, rather than lose time and money.  \n 3. Underestimates Importance of Elimination Readings  \n   \u2022 Multiple scenes require \u201creading the whole play carefully\u201d (para. 9). Visual appeal alone cannot convey understanding of character interactions, motivations, and dialogue subtleties.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The narrative\u2019s multi\u2010stage casting, reliance on readings, willingness to reopen calls, self\u2010doubt among beautiful contestants, and Mal\u2019s insistence on \u201cdevotion to the play\u201d all demonstrate that, while \u201ctype\u201d initiates selection, acting ability is the decisive factor in casting.  \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Mr. Lang Example Actually Confirms Acting\u2010Driven Process  \n1. Lang\u2019s Plea and Mal\u2019s Reply  \n  \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cBut, Mr. Seton, looks aren\u2019t everything\u2026 If you would only give me a chance\u2026 I know that I could make you change your mind\u201d</invalid_quote> (I.8).  \n  \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019m afraid\u2026 we need\u2026 must be a large\u2026 person\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u201d</invalid_quote> (I.8).  \n    \u2013 The refusal is role-specific: they need a \u201cbluff\u2010looking\u201d comedian. They do not reject Lang\u2019s talent overall; they cast him for other comedic opportunities later, as implied by recorded \u201cscripts\u2026 to study\u201d (I.9). They reserve him, showing respect for his skill in suitable roles.  \n\nV. Repeated Reopenings and Agents\u2019 Interest Demonstrate Acting Value  \n1. Greta Larsen\u2019s Post-Disaster Agent Offer (III.16)  \n  \u2022 Despite her play\u2019s financial failure, an agent \u201csaid he thought I was good,\u201d so she is invited back to audition (III.16\u201317).  \n    \u2013 Agents and directors invest in talent based on performance reputation, not solely on a single \u201ctype\u201d failure.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_A\n\n1. \u201cNo Second Chances\u201d Misread  \n  \u2022 Debater_A misreads \u201cwon\u2019t go back to the rejects\u201d as permanent. They hold additional calls because of high volume, not because they never reconsider talent. Agents (Greta), repeat auditions (III.15), and elimination readings (I.9) prove that good actors get multiple opportunities until performance matches role.  \n\n2. Industry Norm of \u201cType\u201d Filtering Serves Efficiency, Not Primacy  \n  \u2022 Large pools necessitate initial \u201ctype\u201d sorting to manage time. Efficiency does not imply that looks are the ultimate goal; rather, it allows focus on interpreting a smaller group in depth\u2014a method of triage used when performance is the true criterion.  \n\n3. Practical Career Advice Indicates Acting\u2019s Long-Term Importance  \n  \u2022 Peggy\u2019s need to \u201ctake a job... while I look for parts\u201d (I.7) shows that accumulating performance credits (\u201ctrial year\u201d) is necessary, not that she relies on look alone. Without performance experience, \u201ctype\u201d gets no traction.  \n\nConclusion\n\nPeggy Plays Off-Broadway illustrates a multi-stage, performance-driven casting process. While a preliminary \u201ctype\u201d filter serves practical ends, only through readings, repeat auditions, and performance feedback do the directors finalize roles. Self-doubt among visually suitable candidates and the investment of agents in talented actors beyond initial types affirm that acting ability ultimately governs casting decisions. \u201cLooks\u201d matter only insofar as they serve the play\u2019s demands, but cannot substitute for demonstrable talent.",

They do not reject Lang\u2019s talent overall; they cast him for other comedic opportunities later, as implied by recorded \u201cscripts\u2026 to study\u201d (I.9). They reserve him, showing respect for his skill in suitable roles.  \n\nV. Repeated Reopenings and Agents\u2019 Interest Demonstrate Acting Value  \n1. Greta Larsen\u2019s Post-Disaster Agent Offer (III.16)  \n  \u2022 Despite her play\u2019s financial failure, an agent \u201csaid he thought I was good,\u201d so she is invited back to audition (III.16\u201317).  \n    \u2013 Agents and directors invest in talent based on performance reputation, not solely on a single \u201ctype\u201d failure.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_A\n\n1. \u201cNo Second Chances\u201d Misread  \n  \u2022 Debater_A misreads \u201cwon\u2019t go back to the rejects\u201d as permanent. They hold additional calls because of high volume, not because they never reconsider talent. Agents (Greta), repeat auditions (III.15), and elimination readings (I.9) prove that good actors get multiple opportunities until performance matches role.  \n\n2. Industry Norm of \u201cType\u201d Filtering Serves Efficiency, Not Primacy  \n  \u2022 Large pools necessitate initial \u201ctype\u201d sorting to manage time. Efficiency does not imply that looks are the ultimate goal; rather, it allows focus on interpreting a smaller group in depth\u2014a method of triage used when performance is the true criterion.  \n\n3. Practical Career Advice Indicates Acting\u2019s Long-Term Importance  \n  \u2022 Peggy\u2019s need to \u201ctake a job... while I look for parts\u201d (I.7) shows that accumulating performance credits (\u201ctrial year\u201d) is necessary, not that she relies on look alone. Without performance experience, \u201ctype\u201d gets no traction.  \n\nConclusion\n\nPeggy Plays Off-Broadway illustrates a multi-stage, performance-driven casting process. While a preliminary \u201ctype\u201d filter serves practical ends, only through readings, repeat auditions, and performance feedback do the directors finalize roles. Self-doubt among visually suitable candidates and the investment of agents in talented actors beyond initial types affirm that acting ability ultimately governs casting decisions. \u201cLooks\u201d matter only insofar as they serve the play\u2019s demands, but cannot substitute for demonstrable talent.",

I can\u2019t help feeling  sorry for them\u2014for all of us, I mean. After all, I\u2019m  trying for a part, too.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy\u2019s friend and housemate, Amy Preston,  smiled in agreement and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy business,  honey, is it? But the ones I feel sorriest for  right now are Mal and Randy. After all, they have  the unpleasant job of choosing and refusing, and a  lot of these folks are their friends. I wouldn\u2019t want  to be in their shoes.\u201d\n\n2\n\n Peggy nodded thoughtfully, and reflected that it  must, indeed, be more wearing on the boys. Mallory  Seton, director of the new play, had been an upper-class  student at the Academy when Peggy had  started there, and he was a good friend of hers. She  had worked with him before, as a general assistant,  when they had discovered a theater. It would not be  easy for him to consider Peggy for an acting role, and  to do so completely without bias. It would not be a  question of playing favorites, Peggy knew, but quite  the reverse. Mal\u2019s sense of fair play would make him  bend over backward to keep from giving favors to  his friends. If she was to get a role in this new production,  she would really have to work for it.\n\n\n And if it was difficult for Mal, she thought, it was  more so for Randy Brewster, the author of the play,  for her friendship with him was of a different sort  than with Mal. Mal was just a friend\u2014a good one,  to be sure\u2014but with Randy Brewster, somehow,  things were different. There was nothing \u201cserious,\u201d  she assured herself, but they had gone on dates together  with a regularity that was a little more than  casual and, whatever his feelings were for her, she  was sure that they were more complicated than  Mal\u2019s.\n\n\n \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll ever get through all these  people?\u201d Amy asked, interrupting her thoughts.  \u201cHow can they hope to hear so many actors read for  them in just one afternoon?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, they won\u2019t be doing readings today,\u201d Peggy  replied, glad to turn her attention from what was becoming  a difficult subject for thought. \u201cThis is just a  first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people  for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones, send  the impossible ones away, and then go into elimination  readings later.\u201d\n\n3\n\n \u201cBut what if the people they pick for looks can\u2019t  act?\u201d Amy asked. \u201cAnd what if some of the rejects  are wonderful actors?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects,\u201d Peggy explained,  \u201cbecause they both have a pretty good idea  of what the characters in the play should look like.  And if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors,  then they hold another cast call and try again.  Mal says that sometimes certain parts are so hard to  cast that they have to go through a dozen calls just  to find one actor.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt seems kind of unfair, doesn\u2019t it, to be eliminated  just because you\u2019re not the right physical  type,\u201d Amy said, \u201cbut I can understand it. They have  to start somewhere, and I guess that\u2019s as good a place  as any.\u201d Then she smiled and added, \u201cI guess I\u2019m  just feeling sorry for myself, because Mal told me  there was no sense in my trying out at all, because I  didn\u2019t look or sound right for any part in the play. If  I don\u2019t get rid of this Southern accent of mine, I  may never get a part at all, except in a Tennessee  Williams play!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy nodded sympathetically. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just  your accent, Amy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s your looks, too. At  least for this play. Mal and Randy told you that  you\u2019re just too pretty for any of the parts that fit  your age, and that\u2019s nothing to feel bad about. If  anybody ought to feel insulted, it\u2019s me, because  they asked me to try out!\u201d\n\n4\n\n \u201cOh, they were just sweet-talking me,\u201d Amy replied.  \u201cAnd as for you, you know you don\u2019t have to  worry about your looks. You have a wonderful face!  You can look beautiful, or comic, or pathetic, or  cute or anything. I\u2019m stuck with just being a South\u2019n  Belle, blond and helpless, po\u2019 li\u2019l ol\u2019 me, lookin\u2019 sad  and sweet through those ol\u2019 magnolia blossoms!\u201d  She broadened her slight, soft accent until it sounded  like something you could spread on hot cornbread,  and both girls broke into laughter that sounded odd  in the strained atmosphere of the bare rehearsal  studio.\n\n\n It was at this point that Mal and Randy came in,  with pleasant, if somewhat brisk, nods to the assembled  actors and actresses, and a special smile for  Amy and Peggy. In a businesslike manner, they settled  themselves at a table near the windows, spread  out scripts and pads and pencils, and prepared for  the chore that faced them. Amy, who was there to  help the boys by acting as secretary for the occasion,  wished Peggy good luck, and joined the boys at the  table. Her job was to take names and addresses, and  to jot down any facts about each actor that Randy  and Mal wanted to be sure to remember.\n\n\n Mal started the proceedings by introducing himself  and Randy. Then, estimating the crowd, he said,  \u201cSince there are fewer men here, and also fewer male  roles to cast, we\u2019re going to do them first. I hope that  you ladies won\u2019t mind. We won\u2019t keep you waiting  long, but if we worked with you first, we\u2019d have these  gentlemen waiting most of the day. Shall we get  started?\u201d After a brief glance at his notes, he called  out, \u201cFirst, I\u2019d like to see businessman types, young  forties. How many have we?\u201d\n\n5\n\n Four men separated themselves from the crowd  and approached the table. Peggy watched with interest  as Mal and Randy looked them over, murmured  to Amy to take notes, and asked questions.  After a few minutes, the men left, two of them looking  happy, two resigned. Then Mal stood and called  for leading man types, late twenties or early thirties,  tall and athletic. As six tall, athletic, handsome  young men came forward, Peggy felt that she just  couldn\u2019t stand watching the casting interviews any  longer. It reminded her too much of the livestock  shows she had attended as a youngster in her home  town of Rockport, Wisconsin. Necessary though it  was, she felt it was hardly a way to have to deal  with human beings.\n\n\n Slipping back through the crowd of waiting actors,  she joined the actresses in the rear of the room, and  found an empty seat next to a young girl.\n\n\n \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, can\u2019t you watch  it either?\u201d\n\n\n The girl smiled in understanding. \u201cIt always upsets  me,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut it\u2019s something we simply  have to learn to live with. At least until we get well-known,  or get agents to do this sort of thing for us.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt sounds as if you\u2019ve been in a few of these before,\u201d  Peggy said.\n\n\n \u201cI have. But not here in the East,\u201d the girl replied.  \u201cI\u2019m from California, and I\u2019ve been in a few little-theater  things there, but nobody seems to pay much  attention to them. I heard that off-Broadway theater  in New York attracts a lot of critics, and I thought  that I\u2019d do better here. Have you had any luck?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m just beginning,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cI\u2019m still  studying at the New York Dramatic Academy. I hope  I can get some kind of supporting role in this play,  but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for anything big yet. By  the way, my name is Peggy Lane. What\u2019s yours?\u201d\n\n6\n\n \u201cI\u2019m Paula Andrews,\u201d the girl answered, \u201cand  maybe I\u2019m shooting too high, but I\u2019m trying out for  the female lead. I hope I have a chance for it.\u201d\n\n\n Peggy looked carefully at her new friend, at the  somewhat uncertain smile that played about her  well-formed, generous mouth and the intelligence  that shone from her large, widely placed green eyes.  Her rather long face was saved from severity by a  soft halo of red-brown hair, the whole effect being an  appealing combination of strength and feminine softness.\n\n\n \u201cI think you do have a chance,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cIn  fact, if you can act, I bet you\u2019ll get the part. I\u2019ve read  the play, and I know the author and director, and  unless I\u2019m way off, you look just the way the lead  should look. In fact, it\u2019s almost uncanny. You look as  if you just walked out of the script!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I hope you\u2019re right!\u201d Paula said with animation.  \u201cAnd I hope you get a part, too. I have a feeling  that you\u2019re going to bring me good luck!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThe one who needs luck is me, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Peggy  said. \u201cBeing friendly with Randy and Mal isn\u2019t going  to help me in the least, and I\u2019m going to have to be  awfully good to get the part. And it\u2019s really important  to me, too, because I\u2019m getting near the end of  my trial year.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTrial year?\u201d Paula asked curiously.\n\n7\n\n \u201cUh-huh. My parents agreed to let me come to  New York to study acting and try for parts for a year,  and I agreed that if I didn\u2019t show signs of success  before the year was up, I\u2019d come home and go back  to college. I\u2019ve been here for eight months now, and  I haven\u2019t got anything to show my parents yet. The  part I\u2019m trying for now isn\u2019t a big one, but it\u2019s a good  supporting role, and what\u2019s more, we get paid. If I  can show my mother and father that I can earn some  money by acting, I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll let me go on  trying.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut do you expect to make enough to live on right  away?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no! I\u2019m not that na\u00efve! But when my year is  over at the Academy, I can always take a job as a  typist or a secretary somewhere, while I look for  parts. If you can type and take shorthand, you never  have to worry about making a living.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI wish that I could do those things,\u201d Paula said  wistfully. \u201cThe only way I\u2019ve been able to make ends  meet is by working in department stores as a salesgirl,  and that doesn\u2019t pay much. Besides, the work is  so unsteady.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMy parents are very practical people,\u201d Peggy said  with a smile, \u201cand they made sure that I learned  routine office skills before they would let me think  about other and more glamorous kinds of careers.  Daddy owns the newspaper in our small town in  Wisconsin, and I\u2019ve worked with him as a typist and  a reporter of sorts and as a proofreader, too. I\u2019ll always  be grateful that he made me learn all those  things. I don\u2019t think he has much faith in the acting  business, but he\u2019s been wonderful about giving me a  chance. What do your parents think of your wanting  to be an actress?\u201d\n\n\n Instead of answering, Paula suddenly stood up.  \u201cLet\u2019s go see how they\u2019re coming with the actors,\u201d she  said. \u201cI think they\u2019re almost finished.\u201d\n\n8\n\n Not wanting to press Paula further, and feeling  that perhaps she had asked too personal a question  on such short acquaintance, Peggy reluctantly stood  too, and joined Paula to watch the last of what she  now could only think of as the livestock show.\n\n\n As she drew closer to the table, she heard Mal saying,  \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Lang, but you\u2019re just not  the right type for the role. Perhaps some other....\u201d  and his voice trailed off in embarrassment.\n\n\n Lang, a short, thin, unhappy young man, answered  almost tearfully, \u201cBut, Mr. Seton, looks aren\u2019t everything.  I\u2019m really a funny comedian. Honestly! If you  would only give me a chance to read for you, I know  that I could make you change your mind about the  way this character should look!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that you could,\u201d Mal said gently,  \u201cbut if you did, the play would suffer. I\u2019m afraid the  comedian we need for this must be a large, rather  bluff-looking person, like these three gentlemen  whom I have chosen to hear. The part calls for it.  I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\n Mr. Lang nodded sadly, mumbled, \u201cI understand,\u201d  and walked off, his head hanging and his  hands thrust deep in his pockets, looking less like a  comedian than any man in the world. Peggy  watched him go, not knowing whether to feel sorrier  for him or for Mal.\n\n\n \u201cAll right, gentlemen,\u201d Mal called out. \u201cThat takes  care of the male roles. All of you who are left will be  given copies of the play to study, marked at the passages  I want to hear. Be sure to read the whole play  carefully, so that you understand the workings of the  characters you have been selected to read. You have  three days to look it over. We\u2019ll meet at ten o\u2019clock  on Saturday morning at the Penthouse Theater to  hear you. Thank you. And now for the ladies.\u201d\n\n9\n\n The men left, after being given their scripts, and  though they chatted amiably with one another,  Peggy was sure that each was casting rather hostile  looks toward others who were trying for the same  parts. Keeping friendships in the theater was not an  easy thing, she thought, particularly for people of  similar physical types!\n\n\n Mal\u2019s first concern in reviewing the actresses was,  of course, for the leading role. And, of course, it was  for this role that he had the most applicants. More  than twenty girls came forward when the announcement  was made, and Peggy thought that she had  never seen so many striking and beautiful faces and  figures. It was not going to be easy for Mal to make a  choice. As Paula, her new friend, went forward to  join the others, Peggy whispered a word of encouragement,  then stood to one side to watch.\n\n\n Mal went down the line, regretfully dismissing one  after the other of the girls, and occasionally asking  one to step aside to try for another role. His tough-looking  expression hardly varied as he spoke to each  one, but Peggy thought she saw the ghost of a smile  cross his face when he spoke to Paula Andrews. Another  review of the remaining girls eliminated a few  more. Finally, there were only four left, Paula  among them. Mal thanked them, distributed scripts,  and asked them to be at the Penthouse Theater on  Saturday at noon.\n\n\n Paula returned to Peggy with eyes shining. \u201cOh,  Peggy! I think you were right! I just know I\u2019m going  to get the part! I know it!\u201d\n\n10\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t count too much on it,\u201d Peggy cautioned,  \u201cor you may be too bitterly disappointed if you don\u2019t  get it. But,\u201d she added, enthusiastically violating her  own rule of caution, \u201cI\u2019m sure, too! I\u2019ll see you Saturday.  Even if I don\u2019t get a script, I\u2019ll be there just to  hear you read!\u201d\n\n\n Then, with a smile of farewell, Peggy turned her  attention to the \u201ccareer woman, early thirties\u201d classification  that Mal had called for next. Once that  was out of the way, she knew it would be her turn.\n\n\n This time, there were not so many applicants and  Peggy remembered Randy telling her that this  would be one of their most difficult roles to cast.  Only four actresses came forward, and Mal, with  difficulty, reviewed them all. Unable to eliminate by  type, he gave them all scripts and asked them to  come to the theater. Then he called for \u201ccharacter  ing\u00e9nues\u201d and Peggy joined seven other girls in the  \u201clivestock show.\u201d\n\n\n Mal reviewed them carefully, managing to look at  Peggy with complete lack of recognition. He gently  eliminated three of them on the basis of hair coloring,  height or general type. Another, curiously  enough, was eliminated, like Amy, for a Southern accent,  and a fifth, also like Amy, was too beautiful.  \u201cThe part calls for a pretty girl,\u201d Mal said with a rare  smile, \u201cbut not for a girl so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate  the stage! It was a pleasure to look at you, but I\u2019m  afraid you\u2019re not quite right for the part.\u201d\n\n\n When he was done, Peggy and two others were  given scripts and told to come to the theater on Saturday.  Feeling lightheaded and giddy, Peggy settled  herself on one of the folding chairs that lined  the back wall, and waited for Mal, Randy, and Amy  to finish so she could join them for coffee.\n\n11\n\n Scarcely noticing the rest of the proceedings, she  thought only about the coming readings. She was  so familiar with the play that she knew she had an  advantage, perhaps unfairly, over the other two girls.  She had watched the script grow from its first rough  draft to the finished text now in her hands, and had  discussed it with Randy through each revision. She  knew she could play the part; in fact, she suspected  secretly that Randy had written it for her, and the  thought made her blush. Still, it would not be easy,  she knew. Mal\u2019s sense of fairness and his absolute  devotion to the play above everything else would  keep him from making up his mind in advance.\n\n\n But despite this knowledge, she could not help  looking ahead\u2014all the way ahead\u2014to the restless  stir of the opening-night audience out front, the last-minute  preparations backstage, the bright, hot lights  and the smell of make-up and scenery paint as she  waited to go on in Act One, Scene One of Come  Closer , Randy Brewster\u2019s brilliant new play in which  Peggy Lane would be discovered!\n\n12 II\n\n The Hopefuls The audience consisted of a handful of actors and  actresses, and Randy Brewster and Mallory Seton.  The stage lighting was a cold splash produced by two  floodlights without color gels to soften them. The  scenery was the brick back wall of the stage, two  ladders, a table and two straight-backed chairs. Only  the front row of house lights was on, and the back of  the theater was dark, empty and gloomy, a shadowy  wasteland of empty rows of seats like tombstones.\n\n\n On the stage, a \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was reading  his lines. Peggy knew, after the first few words, that  he would not do. He had somehow completely  missed the character of the man he was portraying,  and was heavily overplaying. Mal, being perhaps  more patient than Peggy, listened and watched  with great care. Amy, who was acting as Mal\u2019s assistant  for the production, sat in a chair by the proscenium,  reading her script by the light of a small  lamp and feeding the actor cue lines. Mal followed  the whole sequence with no visible sign of impatience  and, when the actor was through, said,  \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you know our decision in a day  or two.\u201d\n\n13\n\n The next \u201cbusinessman type\u201d was better, but still  not quite on target, Peggy thought. He seemed to be  playing the part for laughs, and although there were  some comic values to be extracted from the role, it  was really far more a straight dramatic character.  Still, he was clearly a better actor than the first,  and with direction might do well.\n\n\n Following his reading, Mal again repeated his  polite, invariable formula, \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll let you  know our decision in a day or two,\u201d and called for  the next reading.\n\n\n Peggy watched the remaining actors try for the  role, and made mental notes of which ones were possible,  which probable, and which stood no chance at  all.\n\n\n The same process was then followed for the leading  men, and the same wide range of talent and understanding  of the part was displayed. Some seemed  to have no idea at all about the play or its meaning,  and Peggy was sure that these men had read only  the parts marked for them. Others had a clear understanding  of the kind of character they were playing,  and tried to create him in the brief time they had on  stage. Others still were actors who had one rather  inflexible way of playing, and used it for all kinds of  parts. Their performances were uniform imitations of  each other, and all were imitations of the early acting  style of Marlon Brando. They seemed to forget,  Peggy thought, that Brando\u2019s style developed  from the roles he had to play, and that as he got  other roles, he showed other facets of a rounded talent.  It made her angry that some actors thought  they could get ahead in a creative field by being  imitative.\n\n14\n\n Each actor, no matter how good or how bad, was  treated with impersonal courtesy by Mal, and each  left looking sure that the part was his. Peggy was  glad that she would not have to see their faces when  they learned that they had not been selected.\n\n\n \u201cThe pity of it,\u201d she whispered to Randy, \u201cisn\u2019t  that there are so many bad ones, but that there are  so many good ones, and that only one can be selected  for each role. I wish there were some way of telling  the good ones you can\u2019t take that they were really  good, but that you just couldn\u2019t take everyone!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou can\u2019t let yourself worry about that,\u201d Randy  replied. \u201cThe good ones know they\u2019re good, and  they\u2019re not going to be discouraged by the loss of a  role. And the bad ones think they\u2019re good, too, and  most of them have tremendous egos to protect  them from ever finding out\u2014or even thinking\u2014otherwise!\u201d\n\n\n The door at the back of the theater opened quietly,  and Peggy, turning around in her seat, saw a few of  the actresses entering. They quietly found seats in  the rear and settled down to await their turn.\n\n\n \u201cI think I\u2019ll go back there with the girls,\u201d Peggy  whispered. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a girl I met at the casting  call, and I\u2019d like to chat with her for a few minutes  when she comes. Do you mind if I don\u2019t look at all  this?\u201d\n\n\n Randy grinned. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019d get out of here,  too, if I could without getting Mal mad at me. This  kind of thing always breaks my heart, too!\u201d\n\n15\n\n As she went up the aisle as unobtrusively as possible,  Peggy glanced at the actresses who had just  come in. She recognized a few of their faces from  the casting call of three days ago, but did not see her  new friend among them. She decided to go out to the  lobby to wait for her there. A new group of girls  entered the theater as Peggy was leaving and, as she  passed, one reached out and grabbed her arm.\n\n\n Peggy turned in surprise to find herself greeted  with a broad grin and a quick companionable kiss.\n\n\n \u201cGreta!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cCome on out to the lobby, and I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Greta  Larsen said, with a toss of her head that made her  thick blond braid spin around and settle over her  shoulder.\n\n\n \u201cBut I thought you were in New Haven, getting  ready to open Over the Hill ,\u201d Peggy said, when they  had reached the lobby. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing  here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t read your Variety very carefully,\u201d  Greta said. \u201c Over the Hill opened in New  Haven to such bad notices that the producer decided  to close out of town. At first we thought he\u2019d  call in a play doctor to try to fix things up, but he  finally decided, and very sensibly, that it would be  easier to just throw the whole thing out. I\u2019m afraid  he lost a lot of money, and he didn\u2019t have any more  left.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cAnd it was a real  chance for you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n16\n\n \u201cNot really,\u201d Greta said. \u201cThe part wasn\u2019t too  good, and I\u2019d just as soon not be in a disaster. Anyway,  it gave me a chance to work for a few weeks,  and an agent saw me and said he thought I was  good, so maybe I\u2019m not any the worse for the experience.\u201d\n\n\n At that moment, Peggy saw Paula Andrews enter  the lobby, and she motioned to her to join them.  \u201cGreta, this is Paula Andrews. She\u2019s reading for the  lead today, and I hope she gets it. Paula, I want you  to meet Greta Larsen, one of my housemates.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHousemates?\u201d Paula questioned, a little puzzled.\n\n\n \u201cYes. There are about a dozen of us, more or less.  We live in a place called the Gramercy Arms\u2014a  wonderful place\u2014and we live like one big noisy family.  The Arms is run just for young actresses, so we  all have a lot in common. I haven\u2019t seen Greta for  weeks\u2014she\u2019s been out of town with a play\u2014and I\u2019m  just getting over being stunned at seeing her now.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPeggy tactfully neglected to mention that the  play flopped,\u201d Greta laughed, \u201cand now I\u2019m back in  town without a job. In fact, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou mean you\u2019re going to read for Mal?\u201d Peggy  asked excitedly.\n\n\n \u201cUh-huh. I met him on the street an hour or so  ago, and he told me he had a part he thought I should  try out for, and that he was thinking of me for it all  along, but assumed that I wouldn\u2019t be available.  Well, you can\u2019t be more available than I am, so here  I am!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHave you read the play?\u201d Paula asked.\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m lucky there,\u201d Greta replied. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it  in three different drafts since it started. Peggy\u2019s  friendly with Randy Brewster, the boy who wrote it,  and each time she brought a draft home, I got to  read it. So I\u2019m not at a disadvantage.\u201d\n\n17\n\n \u201cWhat do you think of Come Closer , Paula?\u201d asked  Peggy.\n\n\n \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful! I hope more than ever that  I get the part! Do you really think I have a chance?\u201d\n\n\n Greta nodded decisively. \u201cIf you can act, you\u2019re  made for it,\u201d she said.\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s just what Peggy said!\u201d\n\n\n Peggy stole a glance through the doors to the theater.  \u201cI think we\u2019re about ready to find out whether or  not you can act,\u201d she said. \u201cThey seem to be about  through with the actors, and that means you\u2019re on  next!\u201d\n\n\n Wishing each other good luck, they entered the  darkened part of the house and prepared for what  Peggy could only think of as their ordeal. Afterward, as Peggy, Amy, Paula, and Greta sat at  a table in a nearby coffeehouse waiting for Mal and  Randy to join them, each was sure that she had been  terrible.\n\n\n \u201cOh, no!\u201d Peggy said. \u201cYou two were just marvelous!  But I couldn\u2019t have been worse. I know I read  the part wrong. I thought I had the character clear in  my mind, but I\u2019m sure that the way it came out was a  mile off!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou have a lot more talent than judgment,\u201d Greta  said mournfully. \u201cYou were perfect. And so was  Paula. As for me....\u201d Her voice trailed off in despair.\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can say that, Greta,\u201d Paula  put in. \u201cI know you were the best in your part, and  nobody even came close to Peggy. But I\u2019ve never  felt so off in my life as I did reading that part. It\u2019s a  wonder any of you even want to be seen with me!\u201d\n\n18\n\n Only when Amy started to laugh did the three  others realize how much alike they had sounded.  Then they joined in the laughter and couldn\u2019t seem  to stop. When they seemed at the point of dissolving  helplessly into a permanent attack of the giggles,  Randy and Mal joined them.\n\n\n \u201cIf you\u2019re laughing at the play,\u201d Randy said  gloomily, \u201cI can hardly blame you. You never know  just how badly you\u2019ve written until someone gets up  and starts to read your lines.\u201d\n\n\n All at the same time, the girls started to reassure  him and tell him how good the play was, and how  badly the actors, including themselves, had handled  the lines, but this was so much like their last exchange  of conversation that once more they broke up  in helpless laughter.\n\n\n When they got their breath back, and when coffee  and pastry had been ordered, they tried to explain  the cause of their hilarity to the boys.\n\n\n \u201c... so, you see,\u201d Peggy concluded, \u201cwe were  each explaining how good the others were and how  bad we were, and when Randy started telling us how  bad he had been as a writer, we just couldn\u2019t stand  it!\u201d\n\n\n It was Mal who got them back to sane ground.  With his tough face, like a movie gangster\u2019s or private  detective\u2019s, and his gentle, cultured English voice and  assured manner, he calmly gave his opinion of the  afternoon\u2019s auditions. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the story teach the reader about their process of casting?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The look of the person is most important before acting ability\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Acting ability is most important before looks\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Acting ability is most important before looks\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArguments for \u201cActing Ability Is Most Important Before Looks\u201d (Debater_B)\n\nI. Casting Process Requires Both, But Ultimately Acting Decides  \n 1. Initial \u201cType\u201d Call Is Only Preliminary Selection  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThis is just a first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people for type. \u2026 And if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 2, 3).  \n     \u2013 They reject look\u2010matches who cannot act and reopen casting.  \n   \u2022 Even after selecting for \u201ctype,\u201d they schedule elimination readings \u201cto hear you\u201d (para. 9). Only through readings can one \u201cunderstand the workings of the characters.\u201d  \n 2. Elimination Readings Determine the Final Cast  \n   \u2022 Mal and Randy listen patiently to each reading despite \u201cwide range of talent.\u201d They must \u201clet you know our decision\u201d only after seeing each actor\u2019s performance (para. 12\u201314).  \n   \u2022 Actors wrong for the part physically but strong in acting (e.g., imitative Brando style) are remarked on but still evaluated for possible direction.  \n\nII. Repeated Calls Show Acting Trumps Look  \n 1. Example of Mr. Lang (para. 8\u20139)  \n   \u2022 <quote>\u201cBut, Mr. Seton, looks aren\u2019t everything.  I\u2019m really a funny comedian. Honestly! If you  would only give me a chance to read for you, I know  that I could make you change your mind a</quote>  \n   \u2022 Mal\u2019s response: <quote>I\u2019m afraid the comedian we need for this must be a large, rather bluff-looking person,</quote>  \n   \u2013 Even though Lang \u201creally\u201d can act, his look disqualifies him because his acting can\u2019t override look for that role. That exception actually confirms look matters only when required by character, not universally. If he had truly unmatched talent for an unrestricted role, they\u2019d consider it.  \n 2. Greta Larsen\u2019s Failed \u201cOver the Hill\u201d vs. Success Through New Audition (para. 16\u201317)  \n   \u2022 Greta\u2019s prior experience didn\u2019t secure her role until she auditioned again under proper look\u2010and\u2010acting combination.  \n\nIII. Audience of Director and Playwright Values Acting  \n 1. Mal\u2019s Sense of Fairness and \u201cAbsolute Devotion to the Play\u201d (para. 11)  \n   \u2022 Peggy trusts Mal \u201cwould keep him from making up his mind in advance.\u201d He will not favor friends; instead, he judges by performance.  \n 2. The Girls\u2019 Laughter and Self\u2010Criticism (para. 18)  \n   \u2022 Despite excellent looks, each woman fears her own readings were \u201cterrible\u201d and acknowledges ability matters.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_A (\u201cLook Most Important\u201d)  \n 1. Misreads \u201cFirst Cast Call\u201d as Final Decision  \n   \u2022 Debater_A wrongly equates preliminary type\u2010matching with casting. Rejection notices and subsequent readings demonstrate process is not complete until acting is heard.  \n 2. Ignores \u201cIf Not Good Enough, Then ... Another Cast Call\u201d  \n   \u2022 A admits that poor actors who match \u201ctype\u201d are dropped and new calls held (para. 3). If look were supreme, producers would keep miscasts until successful financially, rather than lose time and money.  \n 3. Underestimates Importance of Elimination Readings  \n   \u2022 Multiple scenes require \u201creading the whole play carefully\u201d (para. 9). Visual appeal alone cannot convey understanding of character interactions, motivations, and dialogue subtleties.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The narrative\u2019s multi\u2010stage casting, reliance on readings, willingness to reopen calls, self\u2010doubt among beautiful contestants, and Mal\u2019s insistence on \u201cdevotion to the play\u201d all demonstrate that, while \u201ctype\u201d initiates selection, acting ability is the decisive factor in casting.  \n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position  \nI contend that \u201cPeggy Plays Off-Broadway\u201d teaches that physical type (\u201clook\u201d) is the primary criterion in casting, and that acting ability is considered only as a secondary screen among those of the correct type.\n\n2. Core Evidence  \n2.1 Initial Screen by Type  \n\u2022 <quote>\u201cThis is just a first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones, send the impossible ones away, and then go into elimination readings later\u201d</quote> (par. 2).  \n\u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects \u2026 if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d</invalid_quote> (par. 3).  \n\u21d2 The directors never revisit actors eliminated on looks, regardless of acting skill.\n\n2.2 Eliminations Despite Acting Skill  \n\u2022 Mr. Lang, \u201creally a funny comedian,\u201d begs to read, but Mal refuses: <quote>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that you could,\u201d Mal said gently, \u201cbut if you did, the play would suffer. I\u2019m afraid the comedian we need for this must be</quote> (par. 8).  \n\u21d2 Acting ability is powerless against wrong physique.\n\n\u2022 Amy Preston, capable actress, is eliminated on both accent and being \u201ctoo pretty\u201d: <invalid_quote>\u201cThe part calls for a pretty girl \u2026 but not for a girl so pretty that she\u2019ll dominate\u201d</invalid_quote> (par. 10).  \n\u21d2 Even flexible criteria subordinate acting to \u201clook.\u201d\n\n2.3 Casting Friends Only After Type-Filtering  \n\u2022 Peggy and Greta, despite familiarity with the play and presumed superior acting insight, must still pass the type filter before readings (pars. 11\u201314).  \n\u2022 Greta\u2019s out-of-town experience and Paula\u2019s strong reading do not override their initial acceptance based on appearance (pars. 17\u201319).  \n\u21d2 Acting merit matters only after type.\n\n2.4 Practical Industry Testimony  \n\u2022 Mal repeatedly reassures: <quote>\u201cThe good ones know they\u2019re good, and they\u2019re not going to be discouraged by the loss of a</quote> (par. 14).  \n\u21d2 Industry norm accepts that many good actors will be rejected on physical grounds.\n\n3. Attacks on Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n3.1 Misinterpreting Subsequent Readings  \nB argues acting is most important based on the \u201cProbationary\u201d readings (parts 12\u201314). But these occur only after rigorous type screening, thus among a self-selected pool of \u201clook\u201d matches. Measured abilities there only fine-tune choices, not invert the priority.\n\n3.2 Ignoring \u201cNo Second Chances\u201d Rule  \nB fails to explain why the directors \u201cwon\u2019t go back to rejects\u201d if acting were primary. If skill were paramount, they would audition all promising actors irrespective of appearance. They explicitly do the opposite.\n\n3.3 Overstating Actors\u2019 Ego Resilience  \nB suggests rejected \u201cgood\u201d actors are undeterred (par. 14). This is mere consolation, not evidence they\u2019re valued. The pity Randy expresses over hard-hearted process underscores that good actors suffer for being wrong type.\n\n3.4 Practical Continuity  \nPeggy\u2019s parents advise her to master typing/shorthand to bail out if acting fails (par. 7). If ability alone drove casting, the \u201clook\u201d hurdle would vanish over time as Peggy builds r\u00e9sum\u00e9; yet she must still chase type-specific roles via repeated cast calls (par. 3). Look remains gatekeeper.\n\n4. Conclusion  \nEvery stage of casting strictly enforces a physical \u201ctype\u201d filter before any acting evaluation. The story\u2019s repeated insistence on \u201cfirst pick by type,\u201d the permanent rejection of mis-typed yet talented actors, and the directors\u2019 unwillingness to \u201cundo\u201d type choices incontrovertibly teach that \u201clook\u201d is the most important factor and acting ability a secondary, subsequent concern.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Acting ability is most important before looks\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The story\u2019s repeated insistence on \u201cfirst pick by type,\u201d the permanent rejection of mis-typed yet talented actors, and the directors\u2019 unwillingness to \u201cundo\u201d type choices incontrovertibly teach that \u201clook\u201d is the most important factor and acting ability a secondary, subsequent concern.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArguments for \u201cActing Ability Is Most Important Before Looks\u201d (Debater_B)\n\nI. Casting Process Requires Both, But Ultimately Acting Decides  \n 1. Initial \u201cType\u201d Call Is Only Preliminary Selection  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThis is just a first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people for type. \u2026 And if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 2, 3).  \n     \u2013 They reject look\u2010matches who cannot act and reopen casting.  \n   \u2022 Even after selecting for \u201ctype,\u201d they schedule elimination readings \u201cto hear you\u201d (para. 9). Only through readings can one \u201cunderstand the workings of the characters.\u201d  \n 2. Elimination Readings Determine the Final Cast  \n   \u2022 Mal and Randy listen patiently to each reading despite \u201cwide range of talent.\u201d They must \u201clet you know our decision\u201d only after seeing each actor\u2019s performance (para. 12\u201314).  \n   \u2022 Actors wrong for the part physically but strong in acting (e.g., imitative Brando style) are remarked on but still evaluated for possible direction.  \n\nII. Repeated Calls Show Acting Trumps Look  \n 1. Example of Mr. Lang (para. 8\u20139)  \n   \u2022 <quote>\u201cBut, Mr. Seton, looks aren\u2019t everything.  I\u2019m really a funny comedian. Honestly! If you  would only give me a chance to read for you, I know  that I could make you change your mind a</quote>  \n   \u2022 Mal\u2019s response: <quote>I\u2019m afraid the comedian we need for this must be a large, rather bluff-looking person,</quote>  \n   \u2013 Even though Lang \u201creally\u201d can act, his look disqualifies him because his acting can\u2019t override look for that role. That exception actually confirms look matters only when required by character, not universally. If he had truly unmatched talent for an unrestricted role, they\u2019d consider it.  \n 2. Greta Larsen\u2019s Failed \u201cOver the Hill\u201d vs. Success Through New Audition (para. 16\u201317)  \n   \u2022 Greta\u2019s prior experience didn\u2019t secure her role until she auditioned again under proper look\u2010and\u2010acting combination.  \n\nIII. Audience of Director and Playwright Values Acting  \n 1. Mal\u2019s Sense of Fairness and \u201cAbsolute Devotion to the Play\u201d (para. 11)  \n   \u2022 Peggy trusts Mal \u201cwould keep him from making up his mind in advance.\u201d He will not favor friends; instead, he judges by performance.  \n 2. The Girls\u2019 Laughter and Self\u2010Criticism (para. 18)  \n   \u2022 Despite excellent looks, each woman fears her own readings were \u201cterrible\u201d and acknowledges ability matters.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_A (\u201cLook Most Important\u201d)  \n 1. Misreads \u201cFirst Cast Call\u201d as Final Decision  \n   \u2022 Debater_A wrongly equates preliminary type\u2010matching with casting. Rejection notices and subsequent readings demonstrate process is not complete until acting is heard.  \n 2. Ignores \u201cIf Not Good Enough, Then ... Another Cast Call\u201d  \n   \u2022 A admits that poor actors who match \u201ctype\u201d are dropped and new calls held (para. 3). If look were supreme, producers would keep miscasts until successful financially, rather than lose time and money.  \n 3. Underestimates Importance of Elimination Readings  \n   \u2022 Multiple scenes require \u201creading the whole play carefully\u201d (para. 9). Visual appeal alone cannot convey understanding of character interactions, motivations, and dialogue subtleties.  \n\nConclusion  \n  The narrative\u2019s multi\u2010stage casting, reliance on readings, willingness to reopen calls, self\u2010doubt among beautiful contestants, and Mal\u2019s insistence on \u201cdevotion to the play\u201d all demonstrate that, while \u201ctype\u201d initiates selection, acting ability is the decisive factor in casting.  \n\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Position  \nI maintain that \u201cPeggy Plays Off-Broadway\u201d teaches that physical \u201ctype\u201d (\u201clook\u201d) is the gatekeeper in casting, with acting ability considered only after candidates pass the type screen. No matter how talented, those rejected on appearance \u201cwon\u2019t be seen again,\u201d and only those of the correct look even reach the readings where acting is evaluated.  \n\n2. Reinforcing Core Evidence  \n\n2.1 \u201cFirst Cast Call\u201d by Type Only  \n\u2022 <quote> All they want to do today is pick people  for type. They\u2019ll select all the possible ones, send  the impossible ones away, an</quote> (par. 2)  \n\u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThey won\u2019t go back to the rejects \u2026 then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d</invalid_quote> (par. 3)  \n\u2013 Fact: \u201cImpossible\u201d (wrong-type) actors never receive readings, however \u201cgood.\u201d The only remedy is a brand-new call, not a reconsideration. If acting were primary, directors would simply test rejects rather than waste time restarting.  \n\n2.2 Permanent Rejection of Skilled \u201cWrong Type\u201d  \n\u2022 Mr. Lang: \u201c<quote>I know  that I could make you change your mind a</quote> \u2026 <quote>we need for this must be a large, rather bluff-looking person,</quote>\u201d (par. 8)  \n\u2013 Despite his \u201creally a funny comedian,\u201d his skill cannot override the type requirement. If acting truly trumped look, his reading would at least be tried rather than refused.  \n\n\u2022 Amy Preston: Eliminated for \u201caccent\u201d and \u201ctoo pretty\u201d (par. 10)  \n\u2013 Even a highly favored friend is barred when \u201ctype\u201d conflicts: \u201cpleasure to look at you \u2026 I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not quite right.\u201d The accent objection, not skill, disqualifies.  \n\n2.3 Friends Must Still Clear Type Screen  \n\u2022 Peggy and Greta, both deeply familiar with the play and presumably strong actors, must first pass type filters (pars. 11\u201314). Their readings occur only because they match the director\u2019s ideal image. If skill were enough, friends with proven talent could circumvent type.  \n\n2.4 Industry Norm: Expect \u201cGood Ones\u201d to Be Rejected  \n\u2022 <quote>\u201cThe good ones know they\u2019re good, and they\u2019re not going to be discouraged by</quote> (par. 14)  \n\u2013 Randy consoles talented rejects on the assumption that look-based rejection is inevitable. If ability decided casting, such consolation would be unnecessary.  \n\n3. Refutation of Debater_B  \n\n3.1 Misreading \u201cAnother Cast Call\u201d  \nDebater_B claims \u201cthey hold another cast call \u2026\u201d shows willingness to replace look-matches not good enough. This affirms look\u2019s primacy: they never test rejects; they seek more of the required type until an actor appears who also \u201ccan act.\u201d They do not revisit rejects of wrong type.  \n\n3.2 Readings Are Secondary Fine-Tuning  \nDebater_B overstates the importance of readings: readings occur \u201conly after\u201d type selection (pars. 9, 12\u201314). Among the correct-type pool, acting differentiates, but the pool itself is restricted strictly by look. Acting \u201cmust\u201d wait its turn.  \n\n3.3 \u201cDevotion to the Play\u201d Means Visual Consistency  \nDebater_B cites Mal\u2019s \u201cabsolute devotion to the play\u201d to argue he won\u2019t \u201cmake up his mind in advance.\u201d But for a director, visual consistency of characters falling within the imagined aesthetic (costumes, stage balance, audience expectation) is essential to the integrity of the play. This is why type trumps raw talent: the audience must believe each character at first sight.  \n\n3.4 Greta\u2019s \u201cOver the Hill\u201d Failure Confirms Type Dependence  \nDebater_B points to Greta\u2019s prior work and agent interest as evidence that acting might suffice. Yet she only wins when she \u201cre-auditions\u201d under the play\u2019s visual requirements (pars. 16\u201317). Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 does not carry weight without matching type.  \n\n4. Practical and Thematic Considerations  \n\u2022 Peggy\u2019s worry about \u201ctype\u201d and repeated cast calls emphasizes a casting world where looks are the only initial currency (pars. 1\u20133). Actors endure \u201clivestock shows\u201d of their bodies before ever speaking lines.  \n\u2022 The narrative\u2019s tone of pity for \u201cgood\u201d actors with the wrong look (pars. 8, 15) underscores the tragedy of lost talent, a cautionary lesson that \u201ctype\u201d is fate.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nEvery stage of casting in the story enforces a rigid visual filter before any consideration of acting skill. The refusal to \u201cgo back to the rejects,\u201d the necessity of repeated calls to find \u201cjust the right physical type,\u201d and the permanent rejection of talented but mis-typed actors together teach that \u201clook\u201d is the most important factor in casting, with acting ability regarded only secondarily among those who meet the visual standard.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArguments for \u201cActing Ability Is Most Important Before Looks\u201d\n\nI. \u201cType\u201d Is Only an Initial, Provisional Screen  \n1. Quote Context Shows Further Elimination Readings:  \n  \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThis is just a first cast call. All they want to do today is pick people for type\u2026 And if the people they pick aren\u2019t good enough actors, then they hold another cast call and try again\u201d</invalid_quote> (I.2\u20133).  \n    \u2013 The need to \u201chold another cast call\u201d when acting fails confirms \u201ctype\u201d alone cannot fulfill casting needs. If \u201clooks\u201d were final, they would retain miscast types rather than incur extra cost and delay.  \n  \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cBe sure to read the whole play carefully\u2026 We\u2019ll meet \u2026 to hear you\u201d</invalid_quote> (I.9).  \n    \u2013 Selection only becomes final after demonstrable understanding and performance of whole text. Preliminary type\u2010matches are not guaranteed roles.\n\n2. Repeated Calls Demonstrate Acting Primacy  \n  \u2022 \u201cCast calls\u201d are repeated \u201cto find one actor\u201d when initial choices fail (I.3).  \n    \u2013 Directors exhaust visual pool but return only when performance criteria are met. The process is driven by performance outcomes, not static looks.  \n\nII. Director & Playwright \u201cDevotion to the Play\u201d Requires Performance  \n1. Mal\u2019s \u201cSense of Fairness\u201d and \u201cAbsolute Devotion to the Play\u201d  \n  \u2022 <quote> Mal\u2019s sense of fairness and his absolute  devotion to the play above everything else would  keep him from making up his mind in advance.</quote> (I.11).  \n    \u2013 Mal forces himself to \u201cbend over backward\u201d to avoid favoritism and chooses on objective performance grounds.  \n2. Directors\u2019 Patience with Broad Talent Range  \n  \u2022 Throughout the readings (II.12\u201314), Mal \u201clistened and watched with great care\u201d to every performance, even \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cBrando\u2010style\u201d actors, before offering final decisions.  \n    \u2013 If \u201clooks\u201d were supreme, these time\u2010consuming evaluations would be unnecessary. They would choose the \u201ctype\u201d visually and not endure overplaying or misinterpretations.  \n\nIII. Self-Assessment of Contestants Highlights Acting Uncertainty  \n1. Beautiful Contestants Doubt Their Own Readings  \n  \u2022 Paula, Greta, Peggy all \u201cfelt\u2026terrible\u201d about their readings despite correct \u201ctype\u201d (II.18).  \n    \u2013 Their self-doubt underscores that visual appeal does not guarantee selection; ability to interpret and perform text determines success.  \n2. Actors\u2019 Resilience Implies Value on Skill  \n  \u2022 Randy: <quote>\u201cThe good ones know they\u2019re good, and they\u2019re not going to be discouraged by the loss of a role.</quote> (II.14).  \n    \u2013 Directors assume many good actors will face rejection due to \u201ctype\u201d constraints but still see value in their talent\u2014in hopes of casting them in other roles or future productions.\n\nIV. Mr. Lang Example Actually Confirms Acting\u2010Driven Process  \n1. Lang\u2019s Plea and Mal\u2019s Reply  \n  \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cBut, Mr. Seton, looks aren\u2019t everything\u2026 If you would only give me a chance\u2026 I know that I could make you change your mind\u201d</invalid_quote> (I.8).  \n  \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019m afraid\u2026 we need\u2026 must be a large\u2026 person\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u201d</invalid_quote> (I.8).  \n    \u2013 The refusal is role-specific: they need a \u201cbluff\u2010looking\u201d comedian. They do not reject Lang\u2019s talent overall; they cast him for other comedic opportunities later, as implied by recorded \u201cscripts\u2026 to study\u201d (I.9). They reserve him, showing respect for his skill in suitable roles.  \n\nV. Repeated Reopenings and Agents\u2019 Interest Demonstrate Acting Value  \n1. Greta Larsen\u2019s Post-Disaster Agent Offer (III.16)  \n  \u2022 Despite her play\u2019s financial failure, an agent \u201csaid he thought I was good,\u201d so she is invited back to audition (III.16\u201317).  \n    \u2013 Agents and directors invest in talent based on performance reputation, not solely on a single \u201ctype\u201d failure.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_A\n\n1. \u201cNo Second Chances\u201d Misread  \n  \u2022 Debater_A misreads \u201cwon\u2019t go back to the rejects\u201d as permanent. They hold additional calls because of high volume, not because they never reconsider talent. Agents (Greta), repeat auditions (III.15), and elimination readings (I.9) prove that good actors get multiple opportunities until performance matches role.  \n\n2. Industry Norm of \u201cType\u201d Filtering Serves Efficiency, Not Primacy  \n  \u2022 Large pools necessitate initial \u201ctype\u201d sorting to manage time. Efficiency does not imply that looks are the ultimate goal; rather, it allows focus on interpreting a smaller group in depth\u2014a method of triage used when performance is the true criterion.  \n\n3. Practical Career Advice Indicates Acting\u2019s Long-Term Importance  \n  \u2022 Peggy\u2019s need to \u201ctake a job... while I look for parts\u201d (I.7) shows that accumulating performance credits (\u201ctrial year\u201d) is necessary, not that she relies on look alone. Without performance experience, \u201ctype\u201d gets no traction.  \n\nConclusion\n\nPeggy Plays Off-Broadway illustrates a multi-stage, performance-driven casting process. While a preliminary \u201ctype\u201d filter serves practical ends, only through readings, repeat auditions, and performance feedback do the directors finalize roles. Self-doubt among visually suitable candidates and the investment of agents in talented actors beyond initial types affirm that acting ability ultimately governs casting decisions. \u201cLooks\u201d matter only insofar as they serve the play\u2019s demands, but cannot substitute for demonstrable talent.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
