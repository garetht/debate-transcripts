{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 24, "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n", "question": "What are the elements that the author seems most perplexed by in the inaugural speeches?", "first_debater_answer": "The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches", "second_debater_answer": "The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras", "debate_identifier": "Reading the Inaugurals_What are the elements that the author seems most perplexed by in the inaugural speeches?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital.

Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are the elements that the author seems most perplexed by in the inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\u201d\n\n1.

The author devotes space to the evolution from classical colonnades of policy to a \u201cbully pulpit\u201d and \u201coratory\u201d that addresses audience behavior directly via \u201cLet us \u2026,\u201d implying his focus is on the rhetorical tool that recurs across eras, not merely isolated themes.  \n   \u2022 He traces the technological basis (radio, television) that allowed the phrase\u2019s impact to grow, linking it back to Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cbully pulpit.\u201d <invalid_quote>Para. 11\u201312</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He even notes mining of predecessors without attribution, suggesting puzzlement at how speechwriters continually reuse and adapt memorable verbal formulas. <invalid_quote>Para. 14</invalid_quote>\n\n3. The author\u2019s statistical analysis of sentence length (<invalid_quote>Para. 13</invalid_quote>) and references to colloquial style underline his concern with form and rhetorical technique rather than specific policy issues.  \n   \u2022 He doesn\u2019t similarly quantify references to \u201cwomen,\u201d \u201crace,\u201d or \u201ctaxes,\u201d despite lamenting their omission or presence. This omission of quantitative analysis for \u201chot topics\u201d underscores that his primary analytical tool is stylistic.  \n   \u2022 If \u201chot topics\u201d were his main perplexities, he would have provided analogous statistics on their frequency, as he did with \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d and sentence length.\n\n4. The author repeatedly invites readers to \u201cponder\u201d more than \u201cwhat issues\u201d but \u201chow\u201d presidents use language to reassure or mobilize.  \n   \u2022 \u201cThere is much to ponder in these speeches \u2026 But there is also much humility to be learned.\u201d <invalid_quote>Closing paragraph</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 His \u201cPostsript\u201d leads back to analysis of Clinton\u2019s address, where again rhetorical devices, not policy novelties, are his prime concern. <quote>Postscript</quote>\n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201chot topics\u201d thesis\n\n1. Many \u201chot topics\u201d (Indians, polygamy, Germany, women, race) are indeed discussed at length by the author\u2014but only to lament their absence or superficial treatment, not to express fundamental perplexity.  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s tone is historical-moral (\u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d) rather than analytical or perplexed in policy terms. <invalid_quote>Closing paragraph</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He notes \u201csilence\u201d or \u201cweak\u201d treatment of race and women as evidence of the authors\u2019 and citizens\u2019 limitations, not as objects of rhetorical fixation.\n\n2. If \u201chot topics\u201d were his central perplexity, he would not call many of them \u201cheard no more\u201d after their moment on the inaugural stage.  \n   \u2022 \u201cMany an issue frets its hour \u2026 and then is heard no more.\u201d <invalid_quote>Para. 14</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He treats these topics as fleeting and regrettable, not as threads warranting sustained perplexity akin to the \u201cLet us\u201d phenomenon, which spans decades and technological shifts.\n\n3. The author explicitly states some subjects \u201cyou expect to appear, don\u2019t\u201d (e.g., Internet). This is an observation about context and audience knowledge, not perpetual themes.  \n   \u2022 This demonstrates his interest in rhetorical accommodation, again pointing to form rather than content per se. <invalid_quote>Para. 13</invalid_quote>\n\nConclusion\n\nThe only element the author systematically tracks, quantifies, and continually returns to across eras\u2014marking its emergence, persistence, and rhetorical import\u2014is the phrase \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d and its derivatives. His use of statistics, discussion of media technology, and analysis of stylistic evolution all converge on this one phrase as the \u201ctell-tale sign\u201d of the third phase of inaugurals, revealing his primary perplexity with its role in shaping public leadership.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My interpretation aligns with the author\u2019s own expressions of surprise and \u201camazement\u201d at what is both \u201csaid and unsaid\u201d in the inaugurals. In particular, he repeatedly notes the conspicuous SILENCE on major issues of their times\u2014Indians, territorial expansion, women, slavery, civil rights, economic crises\u2014and calls it \u201cmost amazing\u201d to a 1997 reader.  \n   \u2022 <quote>Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications,</quote>  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cWhat is most amazing ... is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cAfter World War II the subject [race relations] came back </invalid_quote> <quote> but in a weak and abstract form </quote> <quote> I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal </quote>  \n   These passages show the author is puzzled by presidents avoiding urgent controversies, preferring \u201cacceptable\u201d platitudes to real engagement.\n\n2. \u201cHot topics\u201d silence is a recurring theme across eras. Even presidents who faced economic collapse (Hoover, 1929) or rising dictators (FDR, 1937) conspicuously ignore them:  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cHoover\u2019s inaugural ... gives no hint of economic vulnerability.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 <quote>Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or</quote>  \n   The author\u2019s selection of examples from different periods underscores that this omission is what perplexes him, not any isolated stylistic choice.\n\n3. By contrast, Debater_A\u2019s \u201cconsistent use of one phrase\u201d thesis fails:  \n   a. The phrase \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d appears \u201coccasionally throughout the history of inaugurals,\u201d but only \u201chits its stride in recent years.\u201d It is a modern phenomenon, not a constant puzzle:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThis expression appears occasionally </invalid_quote> <quote> but </quote> <quote> John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times </quote> <invalid_quote> Nixon 22 times.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      The author explains this as a response to technological changes (radio, television) and a self-conscious turn toward \u201cthe leader-preacher\u201d role, not as something that perplexes him.  \n   b. The author provides quantitative analysis of sentence length and attributes shorter, more colloquial style to changing audiences and media:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cIn all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan </invalid_quote> <invalid_quote> 44 words per sentence </invalid_quote> <quote> since Wilson </quote> <quote> 25 </quote> <quote> I do not consider this a deterioration </quote> <quote> but </quote> <invalid_quote> reflects the change in </invalid_quote> <invalid_quote> communication.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      This demonstrates the author\u2019s explanatory comfort with style evolution; there is no expressed \u201cperplexity\u201d about it.\n\n4. The author\u2019s concluding advice\u2014that future readers will be \u201camazed at what we are saying and believing today\u201d\u2014echoes his own amazement at past omissions. He urges humility by learning from \u201cthe ignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d of predecessors. A scholar is more likely to be \u201cperplexed\u201d by their refusal to address foundational crises than by their adoption of persuasive rhetoric.  \n\n5. In sum, the sustained emphasis on silence regarding critical issues\u2014slavery, race, women\u2019s rights, economic collapse, world war\u2014across multiple eras, coupled with explicit statements of \u201camazement,\u201d shows that the author\u2019s central perplexity concerns the lack of discussion of hot topics, not the enduring use of any single phrase. My position fully accounts for the evidence and the author\u2019s own expressions of puzzlement.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are the elements that the author seems most perplexed by in the inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My interpretation aligns with the author\u2019s own expressions of surprise and \u201camazement\u201d at what is both \u201csaid and unsaid\u201d in the inaugurals. In particular, he repeatedly notes the conspicuous SILENCE on major issues of their times\u2014Indians, territorial expansion, women, slavery, civil rights, economic crises\u2014and calls it \u201cmost amazing\u201d to a 1997 reader.  \n   \u2022 <quote>Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications,</quote>  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cWhat is most amazing ... is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cAfter World War II the subject [race relations] came back </invalid_quote> <quote> but in a weak and abstract form </quote> <quote> I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal </quote>  \n   These passages show the author is puzzled by presidents avoiding urgent controversies, preferring \u201cacceptable\u201d platitudes to real engagement.\n\n2. \u201cHot topics\u201d silence is a recurring theme across eras. Even presidents who faced economic collapse (Hoover, 1929) or rising dictators (FDR, 1937) conspicuously ignore them:  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cHoover\u2019s inaugural ... gives no hint of economic vulnerability.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 <quote>Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or</quote>  \n   The author\u2019s selection of examples from different periods underscores that this omission is what perplexes him, not any isolated stylistic choice.\n\n3. By contrast, Debater_A\u2019s \u201cconsistent use of one phrase\u201d thesis fails:  \n   a. The phrase \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d appears \u201coccasionally throughout the history of inaugurals,\u201d but only \u201chits its stride in recent years.\u201d It is a modern phenomenon, not a constant puzzle:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cThis expression appears occasionally </invalid_quote> <quote> but </quote> <quote> John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times </quote> <invalid_quote> Nixon 22 times.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      The author explains this as a response to technological changes (radio, television) and a self-conscious turn toward \u201cthe leader-preacher\u201d role, not as something that perplexes him.  \n   b. The author provides quantitative analysis of sentence length and attributes shorter, more colloquial style to changing audiences and media:  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cIn all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan </invalid_quote> <invalid_quote> 44 words per sentence </invalid_quote> <quote> since Wilson </quote> <quote> 25 </quote> <quote> I do not consider this a deterioration </quote> <quote> but </quote> <invalid_quote> reflects the change in </invalid_quote> <invalid_quote> communication.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      This demonstrates the author\u2019s explanatory comfort with style evolution; there is no expressed \u201cperplexity\u201d about it.\n\n4. The author\u2019s concluding advice\u2014that future readers will be \u201camazed at what we are saying and believing today\u201d\u2014echoes his own amazement at past omissions. He urges humility by learning from \u201cthe ignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d of predecessors. A scholar is more likely to be \u201cperplexed\u201d by their refusal to address foundational crises than by their adoption of persuasive rhetoric.  \n\n5. In sum, the sustained emphasis on silence regarding critical issues\u2014slavery, race, women\u2019s rights, economic collapse, world war\u2014across multiple eras, coupled with explicit statements of \u201camazement,\u201d shows that the author\u2019s central perplexity concerns the lack of discussion of hot topics, not the enduring use of any single phrase. My position fully accounts for the evidence and the author\u2019s own expressions of puzzlement.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe consistent use of one phrase through all of the inaugural speeches\u201d\n\n1. The author repeatedly identifies and highlights the phrase \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d as a \u201ctell-tale sign\u201d of the modern \u201cleader-preacher\u201d inaugural and provides statistics on its increasing use.  \n   \u2022 \u201cPresidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher \u2026 A telltale sign \u2026 is the use of the phrase, \u2018Let us \u2026\u2019 \u2026 John F.

The author devotes space to the evolution from classical colonnades of policy to a \u201cbully pulpit\u201d and \u201coratory\u201d that addresses audience behavior directly via \u201cLet us \u2026,\u201d implying his focus is on the rhetorical tool that recurs across eras, not merely isolated themes.  \n   \u2022 He traces the technological basis (radio, television) that allowed the phrase\u2019s impact to grow, linking it back to Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cbully pulpit.\u201d <invalid_quote>Para. 11\u201312</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He even notes mining of predecessors without attribution, suggesting puzzlement at how speechwriters continually reuse and adapt memorable verbal formulas. <invalid_quote>Para. 14</invalid_quote>\n\n3. The author\u2019s statistical analysis of sentence length (<invalid_quote>Para. 13</invalid_quote>) and references to colloquial style underline his concern with form and rhetorical technique rather than specific policy issues.  \n   \u2022 He doesn\u2019t similarly quantify references to \u201cwomen,\u201d \u201crace,\u201d or \u201ctaxes,\u201d despite lamenting their omission or presence. This omission of quantitative analysis for \u201chot topics\u201d underscores that his primary analytical tool is stylistic.  \n   \u2022 If \u201chot topics\u201d were his main perplexities, he would have provided analogous statistics on their frequency, as he did with \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d and sentence length.\n\n4. The author repeatedly invites readers to \u201cponder\u201d more than \u201cwhat issues\u201d but \u201chow\u201d presidents use language to reassure or mobilize.  \n   \u2022 \u201cThere is much to ponder in these speeches \u2026 But there is also much humility to be learned.\u201d <invalid_quote>Closing paragraph</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 His \u201cPostsript\u201d leads back to analysis of Clinton\u2019s address, where again rhetorical devices, not policy novelties, are his prime concern. <quote>Postscript</quote>\n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201chot topics\u201d thesis\n\n1. Many \u201chot topics\u201d (Indians, polygamy, Germany, women, race) are indeed discussed at length by the author\u2014but only to lament their absence or superficial treatment, not to express fundamental perplexity.  \n   \u2022 The author\u2019s tone is historical-moral (\u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d) rather than analytical or perplexed in policy terms. <invalid_quote>Closing paragraph</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He notes \u201csilence\u201d or \u201cweak\u201d treatment of race and women as evidence of the authors\u2019 and citizens\u2019 limitations, not as objects of rhetorical fixation.\n\n2. If \u201chot topics\u201d were his central perplexity, he would not call many of them \u201cheard no more\u201d after their moment on the inaugural stage.  \n   \u2022 \u201cMany an issue frets its hour \u2026 and then is heard no more.\u201d <invalid_quote>Para. 14</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He treats these topics as fleeting and regrettable, not as threads warranting sustained perplexity akin to the \u201cLet us\u201d phenomenon, which spans decades and technological shifts.\n\n3. The author explicitly states some subjects \u201cyou expect to appear, don\u2019t\u201d (e.g., Internet). This is an observation about context and audience knowledge, not perpetual themes.  \n   \u2022 This demonstrates his interest in rhetorical accommodation, again pointing to form rather than content per se. <invalid_quote>Para. 13</invalid_quote>\n\nConclusion\n\nThe only element the author systematically tracks, quantifies, and continually returns to across eras\u2014marking its emergence, persistence, and rhetorical import\u2014is the phrase \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d and its derivatives. His use of statistics, discussion of media technology, and analysis of stylistic evolution all converge on this one phrase as the \u201ctell-tale sign\u201d of the third phase of inaugurals, revealing his primary perplexity with its role in shaping public leadership.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The lack of discussion of hot topics by presidents inaugurated during those eras\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Kennedy repeated it 16 times \u2026 Richard Nixon \u2026 22 times.\u201d <invalid_quote>Para. 11</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 He traces its sporadic early usage (\u201cappears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals\u201d) into a pervasive modern tool, attributing its rise to the \u201cbully pulpit\u201d and mass media: \u201cRadio and \u2026 television made this [oratorical] contact \u2026 possible.\u201d <invalid_quote>Para. 11\u201312</invalid_quote>  \n    \n   This sustained, data\u2010driven focus on one rhetorical formula\u2014absent for other topics\u2014reveals that this phenomenon, unlike fleeting policy mentions, truly \u201cperplexes\u201d him in terms of its persistence and power to mobilize behavior rather than govern policy.\n\n2. Absence of analogous statistical treatment for \u201chot topics\u201d or policy omissions  \n   \u2022 Despite lamenting the silence on Indians, women, slavery, Germany, economic crises, race relations, etc., the author never offers frequency counts, trend charts, or longitudinal metrics for these subjects. He merely describes them as \u201cheard no more\u201d or \u201cweak and abstract.\u201d <invalid_quote>Para. 14</invalid_quote> <invalid_quote>Para. 16</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 In scholarly rhetorical analysis, quantification signals importance. His choice to quantify sentence length and \u201cLet us\u201d usage\u2014but not the policy subjects\u2014demonstrates that his real analytical concern is style, not content omission.  \n   \u2022 If policy silences were his primary perplexity, he would employ the same method he uses to trace form\u2014as he does when noting sentence\u2010length decline (\u201c44 \u2026 34 \u2026 25 words\u201d) across inaugurals. <invalid_quote>Para. 13</invalid_quote>  \n\n3. The author\u2019s interpretive language distinguishes between descriptive evolution and genuine perplexity  \n   \u2022 He explicitly states that shorter sentences \u201creflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication\u201d and that colloquial style is not \u201cdeterioration.\u201d <invalid_quote>Para. 13</invalid_quote> This neutral or even approving framing shows he is not perplexed by form when he can explain it, yet he persists in analyzing \u201cLet us.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Conversely, he never offers a constructive explanation for why presidents continually resort to \u201cLet us,\u201d beyond describing it as a \u201cvision\u201d or persuasive device. His repeated return to the question of its utility and morality (\u201cUplifting the people \u2026\u201d) indicates ongoing inquiry. <invalid_quote>Para. 10</invalid_quote>  \n\n4. \u201cAmazement\u201d at policy omissions expresses moral judgment, not scholarly perplexity  \n   \u2022 The closing counsels readers to exercise humility regarding \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d of past leaders. <invalid_quote>Closing paragraph</invalid_quote> This is a moral lesson, not a rhetorical investigation.  \n   \u2022 His \u201camazement\u201d serves to highlight historical moral failings to warn modern readers, not to pose an open question he intends to research further, as he does with \u201cLet us\u201d and style evolution in the Postscript. <quote>Postscript</quote>  \n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201chot topics\u201d thesis\n\n1. \u201cFleeting\u201d issues by definition do not sustain perplexity  \n   \u2022 The author notes \u201cmany an issue frets its hour \u2026 and then is heard no more.\u201d <invalid_quote>Para. 14</invalid_quote> A true scholarly perplexity would examine why an innovation persists, as he does with \u201cLet us,\u201d not why it disappears.  \n   \u2022 His lack of follow\u2010up on topics like economic crisis or slavery once they \u201cboil over\u201d contrasts sharply with his continued study of stylistic change.\n\n2. The modern reintroduction of race and women remains \u201cweak and abstract,\u201d affirming his concern with rhetorical constraints, not content  \n   \u2022 He remarks that FDR never mentions race, and post\u2010WWII mentions are \u201cweak and abstract,\u201d suggesting these additions arise from acceptable speech conventions, not from a genuine shift in rhetorical strategy. <invalid_quote>Para. 16</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 If policy engagement were his focus, he would highlight strong inaugurals like Garfield\u2019s or McKinley\u2019s \u201cLynchings must not be tolerated,\u201d yet he treats them as historical curiosities, not sustained studies. <invalid_quote>Para. 15</invalid_quote>  \n\n3. \u201cLet us\u201d spans ideological divides, policy contexts, and media environments  \n   \u2022 From Taft\u2019s era through Kennedy and Nixon, across wars, depressions, civil rights movements, \u201cLet us\u201d unites inaugurals as a rhetorical constant. Its endurance, adaptability, and moral implications (\u201cYou do as I say\u201d) defy simple policy analysis and demand rhetorical inquiry.  \n   \u2022 This universality distinguishes it from any partisan or era\u2010specific \u201chot topic,\u201d and its study illuminates fundamental questions about leadership, democracy, and persuasion\u2014precisely the author\u2019s stated concerns (\u201chow presidents use language to reassure or mobilize\u201d). <invalid_quote>Para. 10</invalid_quote>  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s exclusive use of quantification, his framing of shorter sentences as explained evolution, his repeated return to the \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d phenomenon without definitive resolution, and his moral but not analytical treatment of policy omissions demonstrate that his central perplexity lies in the persistent rhetorical power of one phrase. Debater_B\u2019s thesis reduces the author to a moralist lamenting the past rather than the inquisitive rhetorical scholar his text presents. Therefore, the elements the author seems most perplexed by are the consistent, evolving use of \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d across inaugurals.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. The author\u2019s explicit expressions of \u201camazement\u201d and \u201csilence\u201d point to missing content, not persistent phrases  \n   a. He calls it \u201cmost amazing\u201d that key issues \u201care heard no more\u201d after their moment:  \n      \u2022 <quote> Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. </quote>  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cWhat is most amazing ... is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   b. He laments that even Roosevelt\u2019s 1937 address \u201ccontains no reference to Hitler or to Germany,\u201d and Hoover\u2019s 1929 gives \u201cno hint of economic vulnerability.\u201d These repeated surprises demonstrate his perplexity at omissions.  \n   c. The concluding warning\u2014that future readers will \u201cshake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d\u2014mirrors his own reaction to past silences.  \n\n2. The author provides detailed discussions of specific omissions across eras  \n   a. Slavery and race:  \n      \u2022 Before 1861 only two inaugural mentions of \u201cslavery,\u201d and after Reconstruction it \u201cbegan to fade\u201d until \u201cweak and abstract\u201d post\u2013World War II allusions.  \n      \u2022 <quote>FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals.</quote>  \n   b. Women: \u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear at all until Wilson,\u201d and then never addresses \u201cspecial concerns of women.\u201d  \n   c. Topics like polygamy, coastal fortifications, the Isthmus Canal, Indians and Prohibition vanish from later speeches. These are \u201chot topics\u201d the author expects but finds conspicuously absent. His repeated focus on absence, rather than presence, is the constant.  \n\n3. The \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d phrase is treated as a natural consequence, not a puzzle  \n   a. The author situates it in the third phase emerging with radio/television and credits Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cbully pulpit\u201d concept and changing audience size:  \n      \u2022 <quote> Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. </quote>  \n      \u2022 He describes \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d hitting its stride \u201cin recent years,\u201d implying it is explainable historically and technologically, not inexplicable.  \n   b. He explicitly says the shift to colloquial, shorter sentences \u201creflects the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication,\u201d and that he \u201cdoes not consider this a deterioration.\u201d  \n   c. If he were perplexed by \u201cLet us,\u201d he would not confidently attribute it to media and role changes.  \n\n4. The absence of quantitative analysis on omissions supports my thesis  \n   a. Debater_A complains I offer no statistics on hot topics, but the author\u2019s own lack of systematic counting of omissions shows that these absences are anomalies that cannot be measured like word counts\u2014they break expectations. Their very \u201csilence\u201d is what he finds \u201camazing.\u201d  \n   b. Quantifiable stylistic trends (sentence length, repetition of \u201cLet us\u201d) are predictable and segment inaugurals into phases; omissions defy phases and political pressures. Their unpredictability, across administrations and crises, is precisely what he highlights.  \n\n5. The author\u2019s moral language indicates perplexity, not mere historical description  \n   a. He speaks of the inaugurals\u2019 \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness,\u201d urging humility \u201cto be learned\u201d from their failures to confront crises.  \n   b. He would not urge humility and learning if omissions were expected rhetorical devices; he sees them as moral failings and blind spots.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s sustained focus on what presidents will not or dare not say\u2014despite the gravity of their times\u2014and his repeated \u201camazement\u201d at these silences across eras make clear that his central perplexity lies in the lack of discussion of \u201chot topics,\u201d not in the understandable spread of a rhetorical phrase whose rise he readily explains. My position accounts for every explicit expression of surprise, every lamented silence, and the moral lessons he draws; Debater_A\u2019s thesis ignores the author\u2019s core reactions to omissions and miscasts explained stylistic shifts as perplexing.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
