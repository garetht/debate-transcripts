    "background_text": "Diamonds in the Rough \n\n         Fourscore and seven years ago, the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for business. Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n",

At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs.

Restating My Position  \n   I maintain that the author highlights \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d as a beneficial design feature of new parks, enhancing fan comfort, convenience, and urban vitality.  \n\n2.

Dining Diversity as Catalyst for Urban Integration  \n   a. <quote> communal event that is part of a broader urban experience.</quote> (\u00b618) \u2013 The author cites urban parks\u2019 success in generating better patronage by being neighborhood hubs where fans walk, dine, and socialize. On-site dining supplements nearby businesses and makes the park itself a destination.  \n   b. <quote> retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off.</quote> (\u00b619) \u2013 The total entertainment package, including diverse food options, contributes to the \u201clegs\u201d of urban parks, suggesting dining variety is more than ancillary.  \n\n4. Rebutting \u201cField Shape\u201d as Incidental, Not Beneficial  \n   a. Aesthetic vs. Functional Benefit  \n      - <quote> interestingly shaped playing fields,</quote> (\u00b620) are praised only as visual novelties; the author never ties them to comfort, convenience, or economic benefit for the community. If field shape were truly beneficial, it would offset criticisms of scale and distance\u2014but the author laments oversized parks and distant seats (\u00b67\u20139).  \n   b. Universal Imitation Undermines Innovation  \n      - Asymmetrical fields are \u201ccopied\u201d even in nontraditional parks (\u00b64) yet still draw criticism for size and scale. Mere copying without resolving the distance problem shows shape alone fails to deliver the intimacy or convenience the author values.  \n   c. No Play-Quality Claims  \n      - Nowhere does the author claim better play or spectator sightlines result from odd field shapes; the focus is on \u201cconvincing forms\u201d and \u201csubjective perception\u201d achieved through materials and proportions (\u00b65), i.e., architectural ambiance, not geometry of foul territory.  \n\n5. Luxury Dining Criticisms Misinterpreted  \n   a. The author criticizes subsidies and erosion of cheap seats (\u00b614\u201315), not dining per se. He urges fiscally responsible parks (\u00b622) that still include \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d and basic amenities. Pittsburgh\u2019s proposed 35,000-seat park \u201cwith natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles\u201d still costs $200 million, implying even minimalist parks require adequate concessions for revenue.  \n   b. Dining diversity need not intrude on affordable seating. Urban parks with walk-up fans (Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland) succeed without \u201cmoated parking\u201d strategies, showing that varied concessions can serve all fans and subsidize operations, maintaining cheap seats.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The author repeatedly emphasizes modern dining amenities\u2014plentiful stands, gourmet fare, bars, and restaurants\u2014as core conveniences that improve fan comfort, drive revenue, and foster urban community engagement.

        "speech": "1. Restating My Position  \n   I maintain that the author highlights \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d as a beneficial design feature of new parks, enhancing fan comfort, convenience, and urban vitality.  \n\n2. Direct Authorial Praise for Dining Diversity  \n   a. <quote>\u201cplentiful food stands, and luxury suites\u201d</quote> (\u00b65) \u2013 The juxtaposition of \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d with essential amenities like wider concourses and escalators indicates that varied concessions are integral to the park\u2019s convenience and appeal.  \n   b. <quote>\u201cwait staff who peddle gourmet fare\u201d</quote> on club decks (\u00b613) \u2013 Gourmet menus are singled out alongside luxury suites as part of the \u201creal gold mines\u201d and core revenue drivers; their inclusion underscores the author\u2019s valuation of food diversity as a modern necessity.  \n   c. <quote>\u201cmembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d</quote> (\u00b613) \u2013 Dedicated social spaces within the park extend the communal, urban experience beyond mere seating, encouraging longer visits and broadening the fan base.  \n\n3. Dining Diversity as Catalyst for Urban Integration  \n   a. <quote>\u201ccommunal event that is part of a broader urban experience\u201d</quote> (\u00b618) \u2013 The author cites urban parks\u2019 success in generating better patronage by being neighborhood hubs where fans walk, dine, and socialize. On-site dining supplements nearby businesses and makes the park itself a destination.  \n   b. <quote>\u201cretain more of their patrons after the novelty wears off\u201d</quote> (\u00b619) \u2013 The total entertainment package, including diverse food options, contributes to the \u201clegs\u201d of urban parks, suggesting dining variety is more than ancillary.  \n\n4. Rebutting \u201cField Shape\u201d as Incidental, Not Beneficial  \n   a. Aesthetic vs. Functional Benefit  \n      - <quote>\u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d</quote> (\u00b620) are praised only as visual novelties; the author never ties them to comfort, convenience, or economic benefit for the community. If field shape were truly beneficial, it would offset criticisms of scale and distance\u2014but the author laments oversized parks and distant seats (\u00b67\u20139).  \n   b. Universal Imitation Undermines Innovation  \n      - Asymmetrical fields are \u201ccopied\u201d even in nontraditional parks (\u00b64) yet still draw criticism for size and scale. Mere copying without resolving the distance problem shows shape alone fails to deliver the intimacy or convenience the author values.  \n   c. No Play-Quality Claims  \n      - Nowhere does the author claim better play or spectator sightlines result from odd field shapes; the focus is on \u201cconvincing forms\u201d and \u201csubjective perception\u201d achieved through materials and proportions (\u00b65), i.e., architectural ambiance, not geometry of foul territory.  \n\n5. Luxury Dining Criticisms Misinterpreted  \n   a. The author criticizes subsidies and erosion of cheap seats (\u00b614\u201315), not dining per se. He urges fiscally responsible parks (\u00b622) that still include \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d and basic amenities. Pittsburgh\u2019s proposed 35,000-seat park \u201cwith natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles\u201d still costs $200 million, implying even minimalist parks require adequate concessions for revenue.  \n   b. Dining diversity need not intrude on affordable seating. Urban parks with walk-up fans (Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland) succeed without \u201cmoated parking\u201d strategies, showing that varied concessions can serve all fans and subsidize operations, maintaining cheap seats.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The author repeatedly emphasizes modern dining amenities\u2014plentiful stands, gourmet fare, bars, and restaurants\u2014as core conveniences that improve fan comfort, drive revenue, and foster urban community engagement. By contrast, field shape is an incidental aesthetic, uniformly copied yet insufficient to solve scale, access, or economic issues. Thus, \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is the design feature highlighted as beneficial.",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: \u201cA greater diversity of dining\u201d is a key beneficial design feature of the new ballparks.\n\n2. Claim: Enhanced concession and hospitality options improve fan experience.  \n   a. <quote> abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites-</quote> (\u00b65). Plentiful food stands demonstrate focus on varied dining options, reducing lines and offering choice.  \n   b. Inclusion of \u201cgourmet fare\u201d via \u201cwait staff\u201d on club decks and premium seating (\u00b613) shows the author values upscale, diverse menus as part of modern convenience.  \n   c. \u201cMembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d (\u00b613) broaden offerings beyond simple ballpark food, creating social spaces that attract wider demographics and extend dwell time.  \n\n3. Claim: Dining diversity supports urban integration and economic benefits.  \n   a. Urban parks leverage nearby restaurants and hotels (\u00b618), but on-site bars/restaurants supplement the neighborhood economy and encourage communal arrival/departure patterns.  \n   b. Better patronage and \u201clegs\u201d of urban parks (\u00b619) owe partly to the total entertainment package, including varied dining, not just the game.  \n\n4. Rebuttal: \u201cNew field shapes\u201d are not emphasized as beneficial design features.  \n   a. <quote>interestingly shaped playing fields,</quote> (\u00b620) is an aesthetic by-product of asymmetry, not listed among conveniences or amenities that enhance comfort, convenience, or community. The author praises \u201cconvincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials\u201d (\u00b65) for psychological intimacy, not for playing-field novelty.  \n   b. The core criticisms of many new parks (\u00b67\u20139) focus on their oversized scale, distant seats, and reliance on luxury suites, not on field shape. If field shape were a primary benefit, the author would contrast it with the sterility of multipurpose \u201cmonsters,\u201d yet he does not.  \n   c. Asymmetrical fields are even imitated in \u201ctotally nontraditional parks\u201d (\u00b64), suggesting mere copying, not original game-enhancing innovation. The emphasis remains on spectator experience amenities.  \n\n5. Rebuttal: Field shape can impair familiarity and fairness.  \n   a. Unique asymmetries require teams and fans to adapt, possibly affecting play consistency. The author does not highlight improved play quality.  \n   b. Asymmetry may complicate sightlines and seating orientation, exacerbating already criticized \u201ccaste system\u201d and seat layout issues (\u00b620).  \n\n6. Conclusion: The author repeatedly cites modern conveniences\u2014especially diverse on-site dining, bars, and gourmet fare\u2014as salient, beneficial design features that enhance fan comfort, convenience, and urban-community integration. Field shape, by contrast, is incidental and unconnected to the author\u2019s principal goals for stadium design: intimacy, safety, convenience, and economic viability for cities and fans.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d (Debater_B\u2019s position):\n\n1. Primary author emphasis on asymmetry and field shape  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cBaltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical\u2026 city-friendly ballpark.\u201d</invalid_quote> The author repeatedly stresses that Camden Yards and its successors \u201ctake their cues\u201d from this conceptual breakthrough (e.g., Cleveland, Denver, Milwaukee, Seattle, San Francisco). This imitation \u201cIf you build it, they will copy\u201d applies especially to the asymmetrical outfield (shape) of nontraditional parks in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay.  \n  b. The author calls field shape a \u201cconceptual breakthrough\u201d and the most \u201cgenuinely old\u201d quality revived. By contrast, dining options are merely part of the trappings of modern parks \u201cgilding,\u201d not a conceptual breakthrough or design reference to the golden age.  \n\n2. Field shape tied to intimacy and fan experience  \n  a. Asymmetry and intimacy are linked: \u201cIntimacy has two aspects\u2026 A good architect can ace the second part\u2026 through convincing forms, good proportions\u2026 The exposed steelwork\u2026 beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago.\u201d The field shape contributes to those \u201cconvincing forms\u201d and \u201csubjective perception of size,\u201d enhancing fan engagement.  \n  b. The author notes success of urban parks (Baltimore, Toronto, Cleveland, Denver) in attendance and \u201curban experience\u201d\u2014this success hinges on the field design\u2019s intimacy, not on dining diversity.  \n\n3. Dining is incidental or negative in mobilizing public support  \n  a. Dining and bars are relegated to luxury sections: \u201cmembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d serve high-paying ticketholders. They erode affordable seating and require taxpayer subsidies, which the author criticizes. The author urges \u201clonger view of stadium economics and community concerns,\u201d implying that luxury amenities (including dining) are counterproductive to public welfare.  \n  b. The author contrasts subsidized modern parks with \u201cunsubsidized\u201d classics that succeeded without lavish dining facilities. Dining diversity is not presented as a \u201cbeneficial design feature\u201d in itself but as part of revenue extraction.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d fails as the correct answer  \n  a. The question asks for \u201cdesign features\u2026 highlighted as beneficial.\u201d Dining diversity is not singled out as beneficial; rather, the author laments \u201ccaste system\u201d and ticket-price hikes and warns against \u201cmoated\u201d parking and remote siting that maximize revenue from food and souvenirs.  \n  b. Independent economists discount claims that new stadiums spur regional growth; the author\u2019s compelling argument for subsidies rests on \u201cdowntown or neighborhood location\u201d and \u201ccommunal event\u201d\u2014not on dining.  \n  c. Dining diversity is widely available in any modern stadium, multipurpose or not; it is neither novel nor a revival of golden-age design.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s repeated praise for asymmetrical, quirkily shaped ballparks as the \u201cconceptual breakthrough\u201d that everyone copied, their clear link to intimacy and urban vitality, and the author\u2019s criticisms of luxury-driven amenities (including dining) demonstrate that \u201cthe fields have new shapes\u201d is the design feature highlighted as beneficial\u2014not diversity of dining.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Author\u2019s framing of asymmetry/shape as the conceptual breakthrough  \n  a. \u201cQuirkily asymmetrical\u201d design praised as \u201cgenuinely old\u201d revival: <quote>the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical,</quote> (\u00b64). The author says successors \u201ctake their cues\u201d and \u201ceveryone will want one like it,\u201d underscoring shape as the defining, imitated feature.  \n  b. Nontraditional sites \u201cemulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield\u201d (\u00b64). Dining is ubiquitous; asymmetry is the distinctive element that unites otherwise diverse parks.  \n\n2. Shape directly serves intimacy and spectator experience  \n  a. \u201cConvincing forms\u201d and \u201cgood proportions\u201d (\u00b65) rely on varied field contours to create the perception of closeness. A symmetrical, sterile multipurpose stadium can\u2019t mimic these visual cues.  \n  b. The author links higher attendance and \u201clegs\u201d of urban parks to parks that \u201cstrengthen their cities\u201d through design and \u201ccommunal event\u201d (\u00b618\u201319). Field shape generates neighborhood character and walk-up interest\u2014dining alone doesn\u2019t create unique local landmarks.  \n\n3. Dining amenities are criticized as secondary revenue tools, not public benefits  \n  a. On-site food, \u201cluxury suites,\u201d and \u201cmembers-only clubs\u201d serve elites and erode cheap seating: <quote> the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. </quote> (\u00b612). The author faults these revenue-seeking features and rising ticket prices (\u00b615).  \n  b. Dining is part of \u201cgilding\u201d alongside \u201cbells or whistles\u201d that lead parks to \u201clive on the dole\u201d and exploit taxpayers (\u00b620). If dining were a genuine public good, author wouldn\u2019t emphasize \u201cprofligate public subsidies\u201d or \u201ccaste system among fans\u201d (\u00b620).  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cdining diversity\u201d misreads \u201cconvenience\u201d  \n  a. \u201cPlentiful food stands\u201d (\u00b65) are cited for convenience relative to WWII parks, not as a novel design feature driving the boom. Multipurpose \u201ccold and sterile\u201d parks also had concessions\u2014dining does not distinguish new from old.  \n  b. Author\u2019s economic analysis shows new stadiums raise average prices by 35% (\u00b615), contradicting claimed public benefit of diverse cheap dining. True public benefit arises only from urban siting and \u201cintimate\u201d asymmetric forms, not upscale bars.  \n\n5. Shape over dining drives subsidy justification  \n  a.

        "speech": "Argument for \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d\n\n1. Author\u2019s framing of asymmetry/shape as the conceptual breakthrough  \n  a. \u201cQuirkily asymmetrical\u201d design praised as \u201cgenuinely old\u201d revival: <quote>\u201cBaltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical\u2026 ballpark.\u201d</quote> (\u00b64). The author says successors \u201ctake their cues\u201d and \u201ceveryone will want one like it,\u201d underscoring shape as the defining, imitated feature.  \n  b. Nontraditional sites \u201cemulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield\u201d (\u00b64). Dining is ubiquitous; asymmetry is the distinctive element that unites otherwise diverse parks.  \n\n2. Shape directly serves intimacy and spectator experience  \n  a. \u201cConvincing forms\u201d and \u201cgood proportions\u201d (\u00b65) rely on varied field contours to create the perception of closeness. A symmetrical, sterile multipurpose stadium can\u2019t mimic these visual cues.  \n  b. The author links higher attendance and \u201clegs\u201d of urban parks to parks that \u201cstrengthen their cities\u201d through design and \u201ccommunal event\u201d (\u00b618\u201319). Field shape generates neighborhood character and walk-up interest\u2014dining alone doesn\u2019t create unique local landmarks.  \n\n3. Dining amenities are criticized as secondary revenue tools, not public benefits  \n  a. On-site food, \u201cluxury suites,\u201d and \u201cmembers-only clubs\u201d serve elites and erode cheap seating: <quote>\u201cThe cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer.\u201d</quote> (\u00b612). The author faults these revenue-seeking features and rising ticket prices (\u00b615).  \n  b. Dining is part of \u201cgilding\u201d alongside \u201cbells or whistles\u201d that lead parks to \u201clive on the dole\u201d and exploit taxpayers (\u00b620). If dining were a genuine public good, author wouldn\u2019t emphasize \u201cprofligate public subsidies\u201d or \u201ccaste system among fans\u201d (\u00b620).  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cdining diversity\u201d misreads \u201cconvenience\u201d  \n  a. \u201cPlentiful food stands\u201d (\u00b65) are cited for convenience relative to WWII parks, not as a novel design feature driving the boom. Multipurpose \u201ccold and sterile\u201d parks also had concessions\u2014dining does not distinguish new from old.  \n  b. Author\u2019s economic analysis shows new stadiums raise average prices by 35% (\u00b615), contradicting claimed public benefit of diverse cheap dining. True public benefit arises only from urban siting and \u201cintimate\u201d asymmetric forms, not upscale bars.  \n\n5. Shape over dining drives subsidy justification  \n  a. The lone \u201ccompelling argument\u201d for subsidies is urban cohesion via \u201cdowntown or neighborhood location\u201d where fans walk or transit to architecturally distinct parks (\u00b618). Dining exists elsewhere in cities; only the park\u2019s distinctive form compels communal turnout.  \n  b.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d (Debater_B\u2019s position):\n\n1. Primary author emphasis on asymmetry and field shape  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cBaltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical\u2026 city-friendly ballpark.\u201d</invalid_quote> The author repeatedly stresses that Camden Yards and its successors \u201ctake their cues\u201d from this conceptual breakthrough (e.g., Cleveland, Denver, Milwaukee, Seattle, San Francisco). This imitation \u201cIf you build it, they will copy\u201d applies especially to the asymmetrical outfield (shape) of nontraditional parks in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay.  \n  b. The author calls field shape a \u201cconceptual breakthrough\u201d and the most \u201cgenuinely old\u201d quality revived. By contrast, dining options are merely part of the trappings of modern parks \u201cgilding,\u201d not a conceptual breakthrough or design reference to the golden age.  \n\n2. Field shape tied to intimacy and fan experience  \n  a. Asymmetry and intimacy are linked: \u201cIntimacy has two aspects\u2026 A good architect can ace the second part\u2026 through convincing forms, good proportions\u2026 The exposed steelwork\u2026 beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago.\u201d The field shape contributes to those \u201cconvincing forms\u201d and \u201csubjective perception of size,\u201d enhancing fan engagement.  \n  b. The author notes success of urban parks (Baltimore, Toronto, Cleveland, Denver) in attendance and \u201curban experience\u201d\u2014this success hinges on the field design\u2019s intimacy, not on dining diversity.  \n\n3. Dining is incidental or negative in mobilizing public support  \n  a. Dining and bars are relegated to luxury sections: \u201cmembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d serve high-paying ticketholders. They erode affordable seating and require taxpayer subsidies, which the author criticizes. The author urges \u201clonger view of stadium economics and community concerns,\u201d implying that luxury amenities (including dining) are counterproductive to public welfare.  \n  b. The author contrasts subsidized modern parks with \u201cunsubsidized\u201d classics that succeeded without lavish dining facilities. Dining diversity is not presented as a \u201cbeneficial design feature\u201d in itself but as part of revenue extraction.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d fails as the correct answer  \n  a. The question asks for \u201cdesign features\u2026 highlighted as beneficial.\u201d Dining diversity is not singled out as beneficial; rather, the author laments \u201ccaste system\u201d and ticket-price hikes and warns against \u201cmoated\u201d parking and remote siting that maximize revenue from food and souvenirs.  \n  b. Independent economists discount claims that new stadiums spur regional growth; the author\u2019s compelling argument for subsidies rests on \u201cdowntown or neighborhood location\u201d and \u201ccommunal event\u201d\u2014not on dining.  \n  c. Dining diversity is widely available in any modern stadium, multipurpose or not; it is neither novel nor a revival of golden-age design.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s repeated praise for asymmetrical, quirkily shaped ballparks as the \u201cconceptual breakthrough\u201d that everyone copied, their clear link to intimacy and urban vitality, and the author\u2019s criticisms of luxury-driven amenities (including dining) demonstrate that \u201cthe fields have new shapes\u201d is the design feature highlighted as beneficial\u2014not diversity of dining.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position: \u201cA greater diversity of dining\u201d is a key beneficial design feature of the new ballparks.\n\n2. Claim: Enhanced concession and hospitality options improve fan experience.  \n   a. <quote> abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites-</quote> (\u00b65). Plentiful food stands demonstrate focus on varied dining options, reducing lines and offering choice.  \n   b. Inclusion of \u201cgourmet fare\u201d via \u201cwait staff\u201d on club decks and premium seating (\u00b613) shows the author values upscale, diverse menus as part of modern convenience.  \n   c. \u201cMembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d (\u00b613) broaden offerings beyond simple ballpark food, creating social spaces that attract wider demographics and extend dwell time.  \n\n3. Claim: Dining diversity supports urban integration and economic benefits.  \n   a. Urban parks leverage nearby restaurants and hotels (\u00b618), but on-site bars/restaurants supplement the neighborhood economy and encourage communal arrival/departure patterns.  \n   b. Better patronage and \u201clegs\u201d of urban parks (\u00b619) owe partly to the total entertainment package, including varied dining, not just the game.  \n\n4. Rebuttal: \u201cNew field shapes\u201d are not emphasized as beneficial design features.  \n   a. <quote>interestingly shaped playing fields,</quote> (\u00b620) is an aesthetic by-product of asymmetry, not listed among conveniences or amenities that enhance comfort, convenience, or community. The author praises \u201cconvincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials\u201d (\u00b65) for psychological intimacy, not for playing-field novelty.  \n   b. The core criticisms of many new parks (\u00b67\u20139) focus on their oversized scale, distant seats, and reliance on luxury suites, not on field shape. If field shape were a primary benefit, the author would contrast it with the sterility of multipurpose \u201cmonsters,\u201d yet he does not.  \n   c. Asymmetrical fields are even imitated in \u201ctotally nontraditional parks\u201d (\u00b64), suggesting mere copying, not original game-enhancing innovation. The emphasis remains on spectator experience amenities.  \n\n5. Rebuttal: Field shape can impair familiarity and fairness.  \n   a. Unique asymmetries require teams and fans to adapt, possibly affecting play consistency. The author does not highlight improved play quality.  \n   b. Asymmetry may complicate sightlines and seating orientation, exacerbating already criticized \u201ccaste system\u201d and seat layout issues (\u00b620).  \n\n6. Conclusion: The author repeatedly cites modern conveniences\u2014especially diverse on-site dining, bars, and gourmet fare\u2014as salient, beneficial design features that enhance fan comfort, convenience, and urban-community integration. Field shape, by contrast, is incidental and unconnected to the author\u2019s principal goals for stadium design: intimacy, safety, convenience, and economic viability for cities and fans.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The fields have new shapes\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

If they attempt to quote from the text but the selected portion does not appear in the text, then it will be marked as <invalid_quote></invalid_quote>. \n  - You will respond whether Debater_A or Debater_B's position is more likely to be correct.\n\nHere is the topic they will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\n\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My position: \u201cA greater diversity of dining\u201d is a key beneficial design feature of the new ballparks.\n\n2. Claim: Enhanced concession and hospitality options improve fan experience.  \n   a. <quote> abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites-</quote> (\u00b65). Plentiful food stands demonstrate focus on varied dining options, reducing lines and offering choice.  \n   b. Inclusion of \u201cgourmet fare\u201d via \u201cwait staff\u201d on club decks and premium seating (\u00b613) shows the author values upscale, diverse menus as part of modern convenience.  \n   c. \u201cMembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d (\u00b613) broaden offerings beyond simple ballpark food, creating social spaces that attract wider demographics and extend dwell time.  \n\n3. Claim: Dining diversity supports urban integration and economic benefits.  \n   a. Urban parks leverage nearby restaurants and hotels (\u00b618), but on-site bars/restaurants supplement the neighborhood economy and encourage communal arrival/departure patterns.  \n   b. Better patronage and \u201clegs\u201d of urban parks (\u00b619) owe partly to the total entertainment package, including varied dining, not just the game.  \n\n4. Rebuttal: \u201cNew field shapes\u201d are not emphasized as beneficial design features.  \n   a. <quote>interestingly shaped playing fields,</quote> (\u00b620) is an aesthetic by-product of asymmetry, not listed among conveniences or amenities that enhance comfort, convenience, or community. The author praises \u201cconvincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials\u201d (\u00b65) for psychological intimacy, not for playing-field novelty.  \n   b. The core criticisms of many new parks (\u00b67\u20139) focus on their oversized scale, distant seats, and reliance on luxury suites, not on field shape. If field shape were a primary benefit, the author would contrast it with the sterility of multipurpose \u201cmonsters,\u201d yet he does not.  \n   c. Asymmetrical fields are even imitated in \u201ctotally nontraditional parks\u201d (\u00b64), suggesting mere copying, not original game-enhancing innovation. The emphasis remains on spectator experience amenities.  \n\n5. Rebuttal: Field shape can impair familiarity and fairness.  \n   a. Unique asymmetries require teams and fans to adapt, possibly affecting play consistency. The author does not highlight improved play quality.  \n   b. Asymmetry may complicate sightlines and seating orientation, exacerbating already criticized \u201ccaste system\u201d and seat layout issues (\u00b620).  \n\n6. Conclusion: The author repeatedly cites modern conveniences\u2014especially diverse on-site dining, bars, and gourmet fare\u2014as salient, beneficial design features that enhance fan comfort, convenience, and urban-community integration. Field shape, by contrast, is incidental and unconnected to the author\u2019s principal goals for stadium design: intimacy, safety, convenience, and economic viability for cities and fans.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d (Debater_B\u2019s position):\n\n1. Primary author emphasis on asymmetry and field shape  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cBaltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical\u2026 city-friendly ballpark.\u201d</invalid_quote> The author repeatedly stresses that Camden Yards and its successors \u201ctake their cues\u201d from this conceptual breakthrough (e.g., Cleveland, Denver, Milwaukee, Seattle, San Francisco). This imitation \u201cIf you build it, they will copy\u201d applies especially to the asymmetrical outfield (shape) of nontraditional parks in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay.  \n  b. The author calls field shape a \u201cconceptual breakthrough\u201d and the most \u201cgenuinely old\u201d quality revived. By contrast, dining options are merely part of the trappings of modern parks \u201cgilding,\u201d not a conceptual breakthrough or design reference to the golden age.  \n\n2. Field shape tied to intimacy and fan experience  \n  a. Asymmetry and intimacy are linked: \u201cIntimacy has two aspects\u2026 A good architect can ace the second part\u2026 through convincing forms, good proportions\u2026 The exposed steelwork\u2026 beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago.\u201d The field shape contributes to those \u201cconvincing forms\u201d and \u201csubjective perception of size,\u201d enhancing fan engagement.  \n  b. The author notes success of urban parks (Baltimore, Toronto, Cleveland, Denver) in attendance and \u201curban experience\u201d\u2014this success hinges on the field design\u2019s intimacy, not on dining diversity.  \n\n3. Dining is incidental or negative in mobilizing public support  \n  a. Dining and bars are relegated to luxury sections: \u201cmembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d serve high-paying ticketholders. They erode affordable seating and require taxpayer subsidies, which the author criticizes. The author urges \u201clonger view of stadium economics and community concerns,\u201d implying that luxury amenities (including dining) are counterproductive to public welfare.  \n  b. The author contrasts subsidized modern parks with \u201cunsubsidized\u201d classics that succeeded without lavish dining facilities. Dining diversity is not presented as a \u201cbeneficial design feature\u201d in itself but as part of revenue extraction.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d fails as the correct answer  \n  a. The question asks for \u201cdesign features\u2026 highlighted as beneficial.\u201d Dining diversity is not singled out as beneficial; rather, the author laments \u201ccaste system\u201d and ticket-price hikes and warns against \u201cmoated\u201d parking and remote siting that maximize revenue from food and souvenirs.  \n  b. Independent economists discount claims that new stadiums spur regional growth; the author\u2019s compelling argument for subsidies rests on \u201cdowntown or neighborhood location\u201d and \u201ccommunal event\u201d\u2014not on dining.  \n  c. Dining diversity is widely available in any modern stadium, multipurpose or not; it is neither novel nor a revival of golden-age design.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s repeated praise for asymmetrical, quirkily shaped ballparks as the \u201cconceptual breakthrough\u201d that everyone copied, their clear link to intimacy and urban vitality, and the author\u2019s criticisms of luxury-driven amenities (including dining) demonstrate that \u201cthe fields have new shapes\u201d is the design feature highlighted as beneficial\u2014not diversity of dining.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \n   I maintain that the author highlights \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d as a beneficial design feature of new parks, enhancing fan comfort, convenience, and urban vitality.  \n\n2. Direct Authorial Praise for Dining Diversity  \n   a. <quote> plentiful food stands, and luxury suites-</quote> (\u00b65) \u2013 The juxtaposition of \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d with essential amenities like wider concourses and escalators indicates that varied concessions are integral to the park\u2019s convenience and appeal.  \n   b. <quote> wait staff who peddle gourmet fare.</quote> on club decks (\u00b613) \u2013 Gourmet menus are singled out alongside luxury suites as part of the \u201creal gold mines\u201d and core revenue drivers; their inclusion underscores the author\u2019s valuation of food diversity as a modern necessity.  \n   c. <quote> members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants.</quote> (\u00b613) \u2013 Dedicated social spaces within the park extend the communal, urban experience beyond mere seating, encouraging longer visits and broadening the fan base.  \n\n3. Dining Diversity as Catalyst for Urban Integration  \n   a. <quote> communal event that is part of a broader urban experience.</quote> (\u00b618) \u2013 The author cites urban parks\u2019 success in generating better patronage by being neighborhood hubs where fans walk, dine, and socialize. On-site dining supplements nearby businesses and makes the park itself a destination.  \n   b. <quote> retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off.</quote> (\u00b619) \u2013 The total entertainment package, including diverse food options, contributes to the \u201clegs\u201d of urban parks, suggesting dining variety is more than ancillary.  \n\n4. Rebutting \u201cField Shape\u201d as Incidental, Not Beneficial  \n   a. Aesthetic vs. Functional Benefit  \n      - <quote> interestingly shaped playing fields,</quote> (\u00b620) are praised only as visual novelties; the author never ties them to comfort, convenience, or economic benefit for the community. If field shape were truly beneficial, it would offset criticisms of scale and distance\u2014but the author laments oversized parks and distant seats (\u00b67\u20139).  \n   b. Universal Imitation Undermines Innovation  \n      - Asymmetrical fields are \u201ccopied\u201d even in nontraditional parks (\u00b64) yet still draw criticism for size and scale. Mere copying without resolving the distance problem shows shape alone fails to deliver the intimacy or convenience the author values.  \n   c. No Play-Quality Claims  \n      - Nowhere does the author claim better play or spectator sightlines result from odd field shapes; the focus is on \u201cconvincing forms\u201d and \u201csubjective perception\u201d achieved through materials and proportions (\u00b65), i.e., architectural ambiance, not geometry of foul territory.  \n\n5. Luxury Dining Criticisms Misinterpreted  \n   a. The author criticizes subsidies and erosion of cheap seats (\u00b614\u201315), not dining per se. He urges fiscally responsible parks (\u00b622) that still include \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d and basic amenities. Pittsburgh\u2019s proposed 35,000-seat park \u201cwith natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles\u201d still costs $200 million, implying even minimalist parks require adequate concessions for revenue.  \n   b. Dining diversity need not intrude on affordable seating. Urban parks with walk-up fans (Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland) succeed without \u201cmoated parking\u201d strategies, showing that varied concessions can serve all fans and subsidize operations, maintaining cheap seats.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The author repeatedly emphasizes modern dining amenities\u2014plentiful stands, gourmet fare, bars, and restaurants\u2014as core conveniences that improve fan comfort, drive revenue, and foster urban community engagement. By contrast, field shape is an incidental aesthetic, uniformly copied yet insufficient to solve scale, access, or economic issues. Thus, \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is the design feature highlighted as beneficial.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe fields have new shapes\u201d\n\n1. Author\u2019s framing of asymmetry/shape as the conceptual breakthrough  \n  a. \u201cQuirkily asymmetrical\u201d design praised as \u201cgenuinely old\u201d revival: <quote>the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical,</quote> (\u00b64). The author says successors \u201ctake their cues\u201d and \u201ceveryone will want one like it,\u201d underscoring shape as the defining, imitated feature.  \n  b. Nontraditional sites \u201cemulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield\u201d (\u00b64). Dining is ubiquitous; asymmetry is the distinctive element that unites otherwise diverse parks.  \n\n2. Shape directly serves intimacy and spectator experience  \n  a. \u201cConvincing forms\u201d and \u201cgood proportions\u201d (\u00b65) rely on varied field contours to create the perception of closeness. A symmetrical, sterile multipurpose stadium can\u2019t mimic these visual cues.  \n  b. The author links higher attendance and \u201clegs\u201d of urban parks to parks that \u201cstrengthen their cities\u201d through design and \u201ccommunal event\u201d (\u00b618\u201319). Field shape generates neighborhood character and walk-up interest\u2014dining alone doesn\u2019t create unique local landmarks.  \n\n3. Dining amenities are criticized as secondary revenue tools, not public benefits  \n  a. On-site food, \u201cluxury suites,\u201d and \u201cmembers-only clubs\u201d serve elites and erode cheap seating: <quote> the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. </quote> (\u00b612). The author faults these revenue-seeking features and rising ticket prices (\u00b615).  \n  b. Dining is part of \u201cgilding\u201d alongside \u201cbells or whistles\u201d that lead parks to \u201clive on the dole\u201d and exploit taxpayers (\u00b620). If dining were a genuine public good, author wouldn\u2019t emphasize \u201cprofligate public subsidies\u201d or \u201ccaste system among fans\u201d (\u00b620).  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cdining diversity\u201d misreads \u201cconvenience\u201d  \n  a. \u201cPlentiful food stands\u201d (\u00b65) are cited for convenience relative to WWII parks, not as a novel design feature driving the boom. Multipurpose \u201ccold and sterile\u201d parks also had concessions\u2014dining does not distinguish new from old.  \n  b. Author\u2019s economic analysis shows new stadiums raise average prices by 35% (\u00b615), contradicting claimed public benefit of diverse cheap dining. True public benefit arises only from urban siting and \u201cintimate\u201d asymmetric forms, not upscale bars.  \n\n5. Shape over dining drives subsidy justification  \n  a. The lone \u201ccompelling argument\u201d for subsidies is urban cohesion via \u201cdowntown or neighborhood location\u201d where fans walk or transit to architecturally distinct parks (\u00b618). Dining exists elsewhere in cities; only the park\u2019s distinctive form compels communal turnout.  \n  b. Pittsburgh\u2019s minimalist park (no roof, no \u201cbells or whistles\u201d) still promises \u201cnatural grass\u201d and asymmetry\u2014owner Kevin McClatchy\u2019s refusal to chase dining or luxury highlights that shape and surface matter most (\u00b616).  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s repeated praise of asymmetrical field shapes as the \u201cconceptual breakthrough,\u201d their centrality to intimacy and urban identity, and his explicit criticism of luxury-driven dining demonstrate that \u201cthe fields have new shapes\u201d is the beneficial design feature\u2014not Debater_A\u2019s generic dining diversity, which the author treats as a revenue-driven nuisance rather than a public amenity.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
