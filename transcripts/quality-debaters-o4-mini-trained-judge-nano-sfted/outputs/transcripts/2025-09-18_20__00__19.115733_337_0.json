    "background_text": "The Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n",

Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"One generation of humans\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMultiple generations of humans over time\u201d\n\n1. The author explicitly contrasts \u201ctinkering\u201d with training against long\u2010term demographic changes.  \n   \u2022 \u201cI consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing\u2026were exactly the same today as they were in 1896\u201d <quote>part o</quote>.  \n   \u2022 By defining modern training advances as \u201clittle more than tinkering,\u201d the author relegates them to marginal effects within a generation, while attributing real record\u2010breaking to secular trends across generations.\n\n2. Secular trends require many generations to manifest.  \n   \u2022 Increased average size, life expectancy, and earlier maturation are \u201clong\u2010term modifications, not just brief fluctuations\u201d <quote>part o</quote>.  \n   \u2022 The 12\u2010year\u2010old in 1990 is \u201cabout 9 inches taller\u201d and \u201cmenstruates earlier\u201d than the 1900 counterpart. Such improvements cannot occur in a single generation.\n\n3. Expanded genetic pool (\u201chybrid vigor\u201d) accrues over time.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid vigor in humans results from \u201cmigration and admixture of populations\u2026at unprecedented rates\u201d <quote>part. Th</quote>.  \n   \u2022 Admixture requires multiple generations to mix gene pools and allow fitter combinations to arise.\n\n4. Population growth and socioeconomic development.  \n   \u2022 \u201cPopulation has exploded\u201d and \u201cwe are coming\u2026to a worldwide middle class\u201d <quote>part o</quote>.  \n   \u2022 Larger, healthier, more educated populations yield more elite athletes only when changes span many generations.\n\n5. Horse\u2010racing analogy: training and breeding improvements plateau.  \n   \u2022 Despite intensive breeding and training over many generations, race horses hit a biomechanical limit by 1930 and show no improvement since 1986 <quote>part. Th</quote>.  \n   \u2022 Humans, benefiting from continuing demographic trends, have not plateaued. If training in one generation sufficed, we would see faster gains and earlier plateaus, but human records continue improving.\n\nObjections to \u201cOne generation\u201d position\n\n1. Training effects can be induced in one generation but do not explain secular trends.  \n   \u2022 The author concedes that you \u201ccan bring a single generation up to speed through training\u201d <quote>part. Th</quote>, yet emphasizes that \u201cthe trends we\u2019re dealing with transcend individual generations.\u201d\n\n2. Temporary training spikes are reversible and regional.  \n   \u2022 China\u2019s brief surge in female distance running due to state training highlights how gains vanish when training stops, unlike persistent secular improvements <quote>part. Th</quote>.\n\n3. Demographic factors better predict global record progression.  \n   \u2022 Records improve continually across diverse nations as developing societies advance. Training innovations localized in sports elites would not explain record\u2010breaking from new Olympic entrants (172 nations in 1992 vs. 13 in 1896) <quote>part. Th</quote>.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s thesis centers on multi\u2010generational environmental, health, and demographic trends as the engine of athletic improvement. Training and technology, while useful for temporary or one\u2010generation gains, are deemed \u201cmere tinkering\u201d that cannot account for the continuous, centuries\u2010long acceleration of human performance. Therefore, the innovations in athletic training have their most significant impact only cumulatively across multiple generations, not within any single generation.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cOne Generation of Humans\u201d (Debater_B)\n\nPosition Statement  \nI maintain that the author attributes \u201cinnovations in athletic training\u201d primarily to effects within a single generation\u2014i.e., immediate improvements made by training methods, nutrition, equipment, and health care for individual athletes\u2014rather than to demographic or genetic changes accumulating over many generations.\n\nI. Author\u2019s Own Evidence of Single-Generation Training Effects  \n1. Chinese Sports Experiment  \n  \u2022 The author cites China\u2019s sudden rise in medal counts after intensive training programs:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cThe Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment\u2026In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 This dramatic improvement occurs within one or two generations, demonstrating that systematic training, selection, and support of athletes can produce record-breaking performances immediately.  \n\n2. African Distance Runners  \n  \u2022 East African children run daily to school and thus develop outstanding endurance through habitual training:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cIt is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better\u2026The training is what\u2019s crucial, not the blackness.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Their success is credited to environmental practice, not genetic selection over millennia.  \n\n3. Health Care and Nutrition as \u201cTinkering\u201d but Real  \n  \u2022 The author calls training, nutrition, and improved health care \u201cminor miracles\u201d or \u201ctinkering,\u201d but acknowledges they directly \u201cshave\u201d performance times by curing fevers, preventing infant diseases, and optimizing diet:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cAntibiotics cure a runner\u2019s fever before the big race\u2026Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 These effects are felt within the athletes\u2019 lifetimes, boosting the \u201cpool\u201d of top performers in that same generation.  \n\n4. Sports Technology Gains  \n  \u2022 Innovations such as Nike shoes are promoted as shaving milliseconds off 100-meter times. Although the author deems them minor, they nonetheless contribute to each athlete\u2019s performance in the here and now.  \n\nII. Author\u2019s Rejection of Natural Selection and Generational Limits  \n1. End of Natural Selection for Athletes  \n  \u2022 The author acknowledges that natural selection for athleticism \u201cended long ago\u201d and that modern training may even reduce athletes\u2019 fertility:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cThe laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: \u2026today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Thus genetic improvements are not accumulating; instead, training replaces selection.  \n\n2. Race-Horse Plateau vs. Human Upswing  \n  \u2022 Race horses, despite optimal genetic selection over many generations, have plateaued:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cFrom 1986 to 1996\u2026the average time has been\u20142:39\u2026generations of careful genetic selection\u2026but you can go only so far.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Humans, by contrast, are still improving rapidly due to environmental/training factors, not genetics.  \n\nIII. Critique of \u201cMultiple Generations\u201d Argument  \n1. Secular Trends Are Non-Selective and Slow  \n  \u2022 Increases in stature, menarche timing, and life expectancy are \u201csecular trends\u201d from nutrition and health, but these act over decades:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cGirls menstruate earlier by three or four months per decade\u2026you have to stoop in Tudor cottages.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 These slow changes cannot account for China\u2019s medal surge or fast breaks of records at each Olympics.  \n\n2. Hybrid Vigor Hypothesis Is Speculative and Marginal  \n  \u2022 The author calls \u201chybrid vigor\u201d only a \u201cpossible\u201d contributor and emphasizes difficulty in confirming its athletic impact:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cIt is possible\u2026such hybridization is being translated\u2026Perhaps, just perhaps\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Lack of empirical support makes long-term genetic admixture a weak explanation for immediate performance gains at specific Games.  \n\n3. Demographic Expansion Alone Doesn\u2019t Explain Individual Excellence  \n  \u2022 A larger population increases the talent pool, but without training infrastructure, raw genetic potential remains unrealized.  \n  \u2022 Developing nations with population growth but little sports investment do not produce top Olympians.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s own examples\u2014the Chinese sports program, African runners\u2019 habitual training, the continued setting of records at each Games despite a finite gene pool, and the failure of race-horse breeding to continue increasing speed\u2014underscore that \u201cinnovations in athletic training\u201d chiefly manifest in enhanced performance within a single generation. Claims invoking multi-generational or genetic change are either slow, speculative, or demonstrably insufficient. I urge the Judge to recognize that the immediate, environment-driven improvements described are the core of the author\u2019s thesis regarding athletic innovation.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Multiple generations of humans over time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nThe author believes that innovations in athletic training have the most impact on:\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Multiple generations of humans over time\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"One generation of humans\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cOne Generation of Humans\u201d (Debater_B)\n\nPosition Statement  \nI maintain that the author attributes \u201cinnovations in athletic training\u201d primarily to effects within a single generation\u2014i.e., immediate improvements made by training methods, nutrition, equipment, and health care for individual athletes\u2014rather than to demographic or genetic changes accumulating over many generations.\n\nI. Author\u2019s Own Evidence of Single-Generation Training Effects  \n1. Chinese Sports Experiment  \n  \u2022 The author cites China\u2019s sudden rise in medal counts after intensive training programs:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cThe Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment\u2026In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 This dramatic improvement occurs within one or two generations, demonstrating that systematic training, selection, and support of athletes can produce record-breaking performances immediately.  \n\n2. African Distance Runners  \n  \u2022 East African children run daily to school and thus develop outstanding endurance through habitual training:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cIt is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better\u2026The training is what\u2019s crucial, not the blackness.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Their success is credited to environmental practice, not genetic selection over millennia.  \n\n3. Health Care and Nutrition as \u201cTinkering\u201d but Real  \n  \u2022 The author calls training, nutrition, and improved health care \u201cminor miracles\u201d or \u201ctinkering,\u201d but acknowledges they directly \u201cshave\u201d performance times by curing fevers, preventing infant diseases, and optimizing diet:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cAntibiotics cure a runner\u2019s fever before the big race\u2026Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 These effects are felt within the athletes\u2019 lifetimes, boosting the \u201cpool\u201d of top performers in that same generation.  \n\n4. Sports Technology Gains  \n  \u2022 Innovations such as Nike shoes are promoted as shaving milliseconds off 100-meter times. Although the author deems them minor, they nonetheless contribute to each athlete\u2019s performance in the here and now.  \n\nII. Author\u2019s Rejection of Natural Selection and Generational Limits  \n1. End of Natural Selection for Athletes  \n  \u2022 The author acknowledges that natural selection for athleticism \u201cended long ago\u201d and that modern training may even reduce athletes\u2019 fertility:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cThe laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: \u2026today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Thus genetic improvements are not accumulating; instead, training replaces selection.  \n\n2. Race-Horse Plateau vs. Human Upswing  \n  \u2022 Race horses, despite optimal genetic selection over many generations, have plateaued:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cFrom 1986 to 1996\u2026the average time has been\u20142:39\u2026generations of careful genetic selection\u2026but you can go only so far.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Humans, by contrast, are still improving rapidly due to environmental/training factors, not genetics.  \n\nIII. Critique of \u201cMultiple Generations\u201d Argument  \n1. Secular Trends Are Non-Selective and Slow  \n  \u2022 Increases in stature, menarche timing, and life expectancy are \u201csecular trends\u201d from nutrition and health, but these act over decades:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cGirls menstruate earlier by three or four months per decade\u2026you have to stoop in Tudor cottages.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 These slow changes cannot account for China\u2019s medal surge or fast breaks of records at each Olympics.  \n\n2. Hybrid Vigor Hypothesis Is Speculative and Marginal  \n  \u2022 The author calls \u201chybrid vigor\u201d only a \u201cpossible\u201d contributor and emphasizes difficulty in confirming its athletic impact:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cIt is possible\u2026such hybridization is being translated\u2026Perhaps, just perhaps\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Lack of empirical support makes long-term genetic admixture a weak explanation for immediate performance gains at specific Games.  \n\n3. Demographic Expansion Alone Doesn\u2019t Explain Individual Excellence  \n  \u2022 A larger population increases the talent pool, but without training infrastructure, raw genetic potential remains unrealized.  \n  \u2022 Developing nations with population growth but little sports investment do not produce top Olympians.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s own examples\u2014the Chinese sports program, African runners\u2019 habitual training, the continued setting of records at each Games despite a finite gene pool, and the failure of race-horse breeding to continue increasing speed\u2014underscore that \u201cinnovations in athletic training\u201d chiefly manifest in enhanced performance within a single generation. Claims invoking multi-generational or genetic change are either slow, speculative, or demonstrably insufficient. I urge the Judge to recognize that the immediate, environment-driven improvements described are the core of the author\u2019s thesis regarding athletic innovation.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMultiple generations of humans over time\u201d\n\n1.

Secular trends require many generations to manifest.  \n   \u2022 Increased average size, life expectancy, and earlier maturation are \u201clong\u2010term modifications, not just brief fluctuations\u201d <quote>part o</quote>.  \n   \u2022 The 12\u2010year\u2010old in 1990 is \u201cabout 9 inches taller\u201d and \u201cmenstruates earlier\u201d than the 1900 counterpart. Such improvements cannot occur in a single generation.\n\n3. Expanded genetic pool (\u201chybrid vigor\u201d) accrues over time.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid vigor in humans results from \u201cmigration and admixture of populations\u2026at unprecedented rates\u201d <quote>part.

Th</quote>.  \n   \u2022 Humans, benefiting from continuing demographic trends, have not plateaued.

Th</quote>.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s thesis centers on multi\u2010generational environmental, health, and demographic trends as the engine of athletic improvement. Training and technology, while useful for temporary or one\u2010generation gains, are deemed \u201cmere tinkering\u201d that cannot account for the continuous, centuries\u2010long acceleration of human performance. Therefore, the innovations in athletic training have their most significant impact only cumulatively across multiple generations, not within any single generation.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"One generation of humans\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Th</quote>.  \n   \u2022 Humans, benefiting from continuing demographic trends, have not plateaued. If training in one generation sufficed, we would see faster gains and earlier plateaus, but human records continue improving.\n\nObjections to \u201cOne generation\u201d position\n\n1. Training effects can be induced in one generation but do not explain secular trends.  \n   \u2022 The author concedes that you \u201ccan bring a single generation up to speed through training\u201d <quote>part. Th</quote>, yet emphasizes that \u201cthe trends we\u2019re dealing with transcend individual generations.\u201d\n\n2. Temporary training spikes are reversible and regional.  \n   \u2022 China\u2019s brief surge in female distance running due to state training highlights how gains vanish when training stops, unlike persistent secular improvements <quote>part. Th</quote>.\n\n3. Demographic factors better predict global record progression.  \n   \u2022 Records improve continually across diverse nations as developing societies advance. Training innovations localized in sports elites would not explain record\u2010breaking from new Olympic entrants (172 nations in 1992 vs. 13 in 1896) <quote>part. Th</quote>.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s thesis centers on multi\u2010generational environmental, health, and demographic trends as the engine of athletic improvement. Training and technology, while useful for temporary or one\u2010generation gains, are deemed \u201cmere tinkering\u201d that cannot account for the continuous, centuries\u2010long acceleration of human performance. Therefore, the innovations in athletic training have their most significant impact only cumulatively across multiple generations, not within any single generation.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cOne Generation of Humans\u201d (Debater_B)\n\nPosition Statement  \nI maintain that the author attributes \u201cinnovations in athletic training\u201d primarily to effects within a single generation\u2014i.e., immediate improvements made by training methods, nutrition, equipment, and health care for individual athletes\u2014rather than to demographic or genetic changes accumulating over many generations.\n\nI. Author\u2019s Own Evidence of Single-Generation Training Effects  \n1. Chinese Sports Experiment  \n  \u2022 The author cites China\u2019s sudden rise in medal counts after intensive training programs:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cThe Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment\u2026In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 This dramatic improvement occurs within one or two generations, demonstrating that systematic training, selection, and support of athletes can produce record-breaking performances immediately.  \n\n2. African Distance Runners  \n  \u2022 East African children run daily to school and thus develop outstanding endurance through habitual training:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cIt is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better\u2026The training is what\u2019s crucial, not the blackness.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Their success is credited to environmental practice, not genetic selection over millennia.  \n\n3. Health Care and Nutrition as \u201cTinkering\u201d but Real  \n  \u2022 The author calls training, nutrition, and improved health care \u201cminor miracles\u201d or \u201ctinkering,\u201d but acknowledges they directly \u201cshave\u201d performance times by curing fevers, preventing infant diseases, and optimizing diet:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cAntibiotics cure a runner\u2019s fever before the big race\u2026Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 These effects are felt within the athletes\u2019 lifetimes, boosting the \u201cpool\u201d of top performers in that same generation.  \n\n4. Sports Technology Gains  \n  \u2022 Innovations such as Nike shoes are promoted as shaving milliseconds off 100-meter times. Although the author deems them minor, they nonetheless contribute to each athlete\u2019s performance in the here and now.  \n\nII. Author\u2019s Rejection of Natural Selection and Generational Limits  \n1. End of Natural Selection for Athletes  \n  \u2022 The author acknowledges that natural selection for athleticism \u201cended long ago\u201d and that modern training may even reduce athletes\u2019 fertility:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cThe laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: \u2026today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children than average.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Thus genetic improvements are not accumulating; instead, training replaces selection.  \n\n2. Race-Horse Plateau vs. Human Upswing  \n  \u2022 Race horses, despite optimal genetic selection over many generations, have plateaued:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cFrom 1986 to 1996\u2026the average time has been\u20142:39\u2026generations of careful genetic selection\u2026but you can go only so far.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Humans, by contrast, are still improving rapidly due to environmental/training factors, not genetics.  \n\nIII. Critique of \u201cMultiple Generations\u201d Argument  \n1. Secular Trends Are Non-Selective and Slow  \n  \u2022 Increases in stature, menarche timing, and life expectancy are \u201csecular trends\u201d from nutrition and health, but these act over decades:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cGirls menstruate earlier by three or four months per decade\u2026you have to stoop in Tudor cottages.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 These slow changes cannot account for China\u2019s medal surge or fast breaks of records at each Olympics.  \n\n2. Hybrid Vigor Hypothesis Is Speculative and Marginal  \n  \u2022 The author calls \u201chybrid vigor\u201d only a \u201cpossible\u201d contributor and emphasizes difficulty in confirming its athletic impact:  \n    <invalid_quote>\u201cIt is possible\u2026such hybridization is being translated\u2026Perhaps, just perhaps\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Lack of empirical support makes long-term genetic admixture a weak explanation for immediate performance gains at specific Games.  \n\n3. Demographic Expansion Alone Doesn\u2019t Explain Individual Excellence  \n  \u2022 A larger population increases the talent pool, but without training infrastructure, raw genetic potential remains unrealized.  \n  \u2022 Developing nations with population growth but little sports investment do not produce top Olympians.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s own examples\u2014the Chinese sports program, African runners\u2019 habitual training, the continued setting of records at each Games despite a finite gene pool, and the failure of race-horse breeding to continue increasing speed\u2014underscore that \u201cinnovations in athletic training\u201d chiefly manifest in enhanced performance within a single generation. Claims invoking multi-generational or genetic change are either slow, speculative, or demonstrably insufficient. I urge the Judge to recognize that the immediate, environment-driven improvements described are the core of the author\u2019s thesis regarding athletic innovation.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cMultiple Generations of Humans Over Time\u201d\n\n1. Author\u2019s Explicit Thesis  \n   \u2022 The author repeatedly frames athletic progress as a product of \u201csecular trends\u201d\u2014\u201clong-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations\u201d <quote>Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations</quote>.  \n   \u2022 He asserts that training and technology are \u201clittle more than tinkering\u201d and that \u201csports records would continue to tumble\u2026even if training methods\u2026were exactly the same today as they were in 1896\u201d <quote>consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to</quote>.  \n   \u2022 If training alone drove improvements \u201ctinkering\u201d would be exalted, not dismissed. The author\u2019s repudiation of one\u2010generation effects demonstrates his view that only multi\u2010generational demographic change underlies persistent record\u2010breaking.\n\n2. Persistence vs. Reversibility of Gains  \n   \u2022 China\u2019s sudden medal surge is cited as a \u201cstate experiment,\u201d not as sustainable: the author calls it \u201cenormous\u2026and effective,\u201d yet mentions no Chinese records maintained once programs ended; such spikes prove training can only temporarily approach, not surpass, secular\u2010trend\u2010driven limits <invalid_quote>The Chinese\u2026In 1992\u2026then boy\u2026record\u2010breaking female distance runners</invalid_quote>.  \n   \u2022 By contrast, improvements in stature, maturation, and life expectancy have accumulated steadily for 150 years. A temporary training program lasting a decade cannot explain three- or four\u2010month\u2010per\u2010decade declines in age of menarche <invalid_quote>Age of menarche has decreased by three or four months per decade\u2026for the past 150 years</invalid_quote>.\n\n3. Hybrid Vigor and Pool Expansion Require Generations  \n   \u2022 \u201cHybrid vigor\u201d arises only through \u201cmigration and admixture\u2026at unprecedented rates\u201d <invalid_quote>migration and admixture\u2026at unprecedented rates</invalid_quote>. Crossing isolated populations and propagating fitter genotypes demands several generations to fix beneficial combinations.  \n   \u2022 Expanded \u201cglobal middle class\u201d yields more literate, healthier populations over time: adult literacy in Mozambique rose 20 percent over 20 years <quote>an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years.</quote>. This social development, not short\u2010term training, broadened the elite\u2010athlete pool.\n\n4. Race\u2010Horse Plateau Implies Genetic Limits Even with Generations  \n   \u2022 Horses are \u201cspecifically bred and reared\u2026for generations\u201d yet \u201cfrom 1986 to 1996\u2026the average time has been\u20142:39\u201d with no further speed gains <invalid_quote>generations of careful genetic selection\u2026but you can go only so far</invalid_quote>.  \n   \u2022 If human training within one generation were sufficient, we would expect similar plateaus; instead, human records continue improving, mirroring ongoing demographic and nutritional trends that take many generations to unfold.\n\nRebuttals to Debater_B\n\n1. Misreading \u201cTinkering\u201d Acknowledgment  \n   \u2022 Debater_B cites \u201cantibiotics cure a runner\u2019s fever\u201d <invalid_quote> antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, </invalid_quote>, but the author calls such effects \u201ctrivial\u201d and nowhere claims they drive the long\u2010term trend. He includes them only to acknowledge that even these \u201ctrivial\u201d improvements are overshadowed by secular trends.\n\n2. Chinese and African Examples Are Environmental but Generationally Amplified  \n   \u2022 East African children\u2019s habitual running explains only why certain individuals excel; it does not account for the gradual improvement of world\u2010record holders from non\u2010African nations. As the rest of the world\u2019s children adopt similar nutrition and health, they too catch up in time.  \n   \u2022 China\u2019s \u201cstate experiment\u201d is an example of short\u2010term environmental push onto a population newly enjoying better nutrition and health over generations; without the underlying demographic improvements, even massive training regimens would fail to yield record\u2010breakers.\n\n3. Natural Selection\u2019s \u201cEnd\u201d Strengthens My Case  \n   \u2022 Debater_B argues that natural selection \u201cended long ago\u201d <invalid_quote> the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: </invalid_quote>. This supports that new genetic improvements cannot arise within a generation; only admixture and non\u2010selective \u201chybrid vigor\u201d over many generations can introduce beneficial variation.\n\n4. Speculative \u201cHybrid Vigor\u201d Is the Only Genetic Mechanism Left  \n   \u2022 Debater_B dismisses \u201chybrid vigor\u201d as \u201cpurely speculative\u201d <invalid_quote> Perhaps, just perhaps, </invalid_quote>. But the author includes it as a plausible byproduct of unprecedented global admixture. When the only credible genetic mechanism for ongoing improvement requires generations, training alone cannot suffice.\n\nConclusion  \nOnly by acknowledging the author\u2019s emphasis on secular, cumulative demographic and genetic trends\u2014expressly contrasted with mere \u201ctinkering\u201d of training\u2014can we explain continuous, global improvements in athletics that outpace any known limits seen in single\u2010generation, intensively bred race horses. Innovations in training serve to optimize the bodies that long\u2010term, multi\u2010generational improvements have built. Therefore, the author believes training innovations have their most significant impact across multiple generations of humans over time.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cOne Generation of Humans\u201d  \n\nPosition Restated  \nI maintain that the author holds \u201cinnovations in athletic training\u201d to be drivers of performance within individual lifetimes\u2014immediate gains from methods, technology, and health\u2014rather than slow genetic or demographic shifts across many generations.\n\nI. Author\u2019s Central Examples Are Single\u2010Generation  \n1. Chinese Sports Experiment Is Immediate, Not Multigenerational  \n  \u2022 \u201cThe Chinese sports establishment\u2026In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic\u2010medal haul.\u201d <quote>the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever.</quote>  \n  \u2022 These achievements arose within a single generation of state\u2010sponsored training, illustrating that focused environment alone can produce world\u2010class athletes.  \n  \u2022 Obverse: After training methods changed and doping controls tightened, China\u2019s distance\u2010running dominance waned\u2014showing lack of underlying genetic shift.  \n\n2. African Runners\u2019 Habitual Training, Not Genes  \n  \u2022 \u201cIt is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better\u2026The training is what\u2019s crucial, not the blackness.\u201d <quote>else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from</quote>  \n  \u2022 Such habitual practice, available to each generation anew, produces champions without invoking inherited genetic change.  \n\n3. Health Care, Nutrition, and Equipment as \u201cTinkering\u201d Yet Effective  \n  \u2022 \u201cA new Nike shoe\u2026will shave at least one\u2010thousandth of a second off your 100\u2010meter time\u2026Antibiotics cure a runner\u2019s fever before the big race\u2026\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cSports records would continue\u2026even if training methods\u2026were exactly the same today as in 1896\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 The author admits training and tech are \u201ctinkering,\u201d yet concedes they \u201cshave\u201d performance\u2014demonstrating tangible single\u2010generation effects.  \n\n4. Race\u2010Horse Analogy Underscores Human Advantage  \n  \u2022 Horses plateau despite optimal breeding over many generations: <invalid_quote>\u201cFrom 1986 to 1996\u2026the average time has been\u20142:39\u2026generations of careful genetic selection\u2026but you can go only so far.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Humans continue to break records, implying continued gains derive from variable environment/training rather than finite genetic potential.  \n\nII. Critique of \u201cMultiple Generations\u201d Arguments  \n1. Secular Trends Are Too Slow to Explain Olympic Records  \n  \u2022 Menarche timing falls \u201cthree or four months per decade\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cin average sections\u2026for the past 150 years.\u201d</invalid_quote> and 9\u2010inch height gain in 90 years\u2014far slower than record\u2010breaking leaps at each Games.  \n  \u2022 If mass nutrition or health alone drove performance, we\u2019d see steady, uniform progress worldwide rather than spikes linked to training regimes.  \n\n2. Hybrid Vigor Hypothesis Is Speculative and Marginal  \n  \u2022 Author uses \u201cperhaps,\u201d \u201cpossible,\u201d \u201cjust possibly\u201d to describe hybrid vigor: <invalid_quote>\u201cIt is possible\u2026Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Lack of empirical support and impossibility of isolating from environment render it a weak explanation.  \n\n3. Population Growth Without Infrastructure Yields No Champions  \n  \u2022 The mere existence of a \u201cmiddle class\u201d or explosion in numbers doesn\u2019t produce Olympians unless training, coaching, and competition structures are in place\u2014as the Chinese and East Africans demonstrate.  \n  \u2022 Many populous, developing nations without elite sports programs remain absent from Olympic podiums, confirming that numbers alone are insufficient.  \n\n4. Opponent\u2019s Race\u2010Horse Objection Cuts Both Ways  \n  \u2022 Debater_A cites horse plateau to support genetic limit, yet horses receive unparalleled training and optimal genetics; humans lacking both plateau far more slowly, indicating training is the differentiator.  \n\nIII. Why the Author Relegates Generational Effects to a Secondary Role  \n1. Natural Selection \u201cEnded Long Ago\u201d  \n  \u2022 \u201cThe laws of natural selection probably work against athletes\u2026today\u2019s top athletes have fewer children.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cnatural selection for athletic prowess\u2026ended long ago.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Without selection pressure, genetic improvements stall\u2014training fills the gap.  \n\n2. Author\u2019s Forecast of Continued Improvement Hinges on \u201cEnvironment\u201d  \n  \u2022 Predicts records in Atlanta, Sydney 2000, 2044 based on \u201clong\u2010term trends\u2026roar along\u201d but explicitly cites \u201ctraining, technology, and demographic expansion\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThese trends will continue to fuel\u2026performance.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 Immediate training is the lever that translates secular trends into record\u2010breaking results generation\u2010by\u2010generation.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s own text repeatedly ties remarkable Olympic gains to training, nutrition, health care, and technology that operate within the lifespan of individual athletes. Speculative genetic admixture and slow secular improvements merely enlarge the raw material; the true driver of record\u2010shattering performance is \u201cone generation\u201d innovations that can be introduced, changed, or removed and show immediate impact on Olympic outcomes. I urge the Judge to recognize that the author\u2019s thesis attributes the most significant impact of athletic innovations to the generational environment, not to accumulated genetic shifts.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
