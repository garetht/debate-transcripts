    "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n",

My thesis captures the author\u2019s overarching purpose: inaugurals are not mere time-stamped snapshots but carefully crafted, often coded, texts that reflect, obscure, and shape the historical forces of their eras. The author repeatedly notes what is unsaid\u2014silences on slavery, women, race\u2014and interprets these omissions as meaningful \u201ccryptic\u201d signals, not as neutral reportage.  \n\nII. Evidence of Cryptic Messaging  \n1. Omissions as Negative Evidence  \n  \u2022 \u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear at all until Wilson\u2019s first inaugural\u2026 never as referring to any special concerns of women\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background, women silence</invalid_quote>). This repeated silence is a \u201ccryptic\u201d indicator of societal blindness, not a mere byproduct of time.  \n  \u2022 \u201cThe words \u2018black,\u2019 \u2018blacks,\u2019 \u2018Negro,\u2019 or \u2018race\u2019\u2026 do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background, race silence</invalid_quote>). The author highlights these gaps to interpret national attitudes, implying that the addresses\u2019 silences are as telling as their words.  \n\n2. Phases and Metaphors  \n  \u2022 The tripartite classification (modest servant, prosaic executive, leader-preacher) (<invalid_quote>Background, three phases</invalid_quote>) is a hermeneutic model, urging readers to decode ideological shifts rather than passively record them.  \n  \u2022 The \u201cbully pulpit\u201d metaphor (leader-preacher) signals an intentional move to persuade \u201cuplifting the people\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background, pulpits</invalid_quote>). This is active manipulation of public sentiment, not mere description.  \n\n3. Intertextual Allusions  \n  \u2022 Reuse of phrases (\u201cLet us\u2026,\u201d \u201cAsk not what\u2026\u201d) without attribution (<invalid_quote>Background, reuse</invalid_quote>) functions as coded appeals to tradition and authority, requiring readers to recognize and interpret these reverberations across time.  \n\nIII. Interpretation vs. Description  \n1. The author warns that future readers \u201cwill shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background, humility</invalid_quote>). He suggests inaugurals are historical artifacts requiring interpretation, with hidden biases to be unpacked.  \n2.

Snapshot view neglects author\u2019s hermeneutic apparatus: phases, word-per-sentence statistics, metaphorical language, and intertextuality.

That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror.

FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union?

But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the author\u2019s overall thesis about inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey Are a Cryptic Way to Interpret History\u201d\n\nI. Thesis and Definition  \n1. My thesis captures the author\u2019s overarching purpose: inaugurals are not mere time-stamped snapshots but carefully crafted, often coded, texts that reflect, obscure, and shape the historical forces of their eras. The author repeatedly notes what is unsaid\u2014silences on slavery, women, race\u2014and interprets these omissions as meaningful \u201ccryptic\u201d signals, not as neutral reportage.  \n\nII. Evidence of Cryptic Messaging  \n1. Omissions as Negative Evidence  \n  \u2022 \u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear at all until Wilson\u2019s first inaugural\u2026 never as referring to any special concerns of women\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background, women silence</invalid_quote>). This repeated silence is a \u201ccryptic\u201d indicator of societal blindness, not a mere byproduct of time.  \n  \u2022 \u201cThe words \u2018black,\u2019 \u2018blacks,\u2019 \u2018Negro,\u2019 or \u2018race\u2019\u2026 do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background, race silence</invalid_quote>). The author highlights these gaps to interpret national attitudes, implying that the addresses\u2019 silences are as telling as their words.  \n\n2. Phases and Metaphors  \n  \u2022 The tripartite classification (modest servant, prosaic executive, leader-preacher) (<invalid_quote>Background, three phases</invalid_quote>) is a hermeneutic model, urging readers to decode ideological shifts rather than passively record them.  \n  \u2022 The \u201cbully pulpit\u201d metaphor (leader-preacher) signals an intentional move to persuade \u201cuplifting the people\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background, pulpits</invalid_quote>). This is active manipulation of public sentiment, not mere description.  \n\n3. Intertextual Allusions  \n  \u2022 Reuse of phrases (\u201cLet us\u2026,\u201d \u201cAsk not what\u2026\u201d) without attribution (<invalid_quote>Background, reuse</invalid_quote>) functions as coded appeals to tradition and authority, requiring readers to recognize and interpret these reverberations across time.  \n\nIII. Interpretation vs. Description  \n1. The author warns that future readers \u201cwill shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background, humility</invalid_quote>). He suggests inaugurals are historical artifacts requiring interpretation, with hidden biases to be unpacked.  \n2. He criticizes inaugurals for \u201cmoral obtuseness\u201d (<quote>and moral obtuseness</quote>), implying a need to read between the lines to understand prevailing values and prejudices.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of \u201cSnapshot\u201d Position  \n1. Mere snapshot ignores author\u2019s focus on omissions. A true snapshot would not treat silences (race, women, economy) as \u201cdisturbing\u201d or \u201camazing\u201d signals demanding interpretation.  \n2. Snapshot view neglects author\u2019s hermeneutic apparatus: phases, word-per-sentence statistics, metaphorical language, and intertextuality. These analytical tools presuppose complexity and intentionality beyond simple reportage.  \n3. If inaugurals were only snapshots, why would the author track \u201cdeterioration\u201d of sentence length (<invalid_quote>Background, sentence length</invalid_quote>) and the \u201ctelltale sign\u201d of \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d usage? These are indicators for interpretive analysis, not mere period detail.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s sustained attention to what is both said and unsaid, his analytical models for decoding style and content, and his admonition that future readers must criticize present beliefs all confirm that inaugural addresses function as cryptic texts demanding interpretation. The snapshot thesis cannot explain the author\u2019s hermeneutic concerns; only the interpretive thesis fits all the evidence.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My thesis: \u201cInaugural addresses present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time.\u201d  \n   A. Opening statement of purpose  \n      \u2022 The author explicitly directs readers to \u201cgive you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 \u2026 but as an ordinary citizen who shares \u2026 the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d <quote>Reading the Inaugurals</quote>.  \n      \u2022 If the speeches were merely \u201ccryptic,\u201d they would not require reading in their entirety to understand the past; instead, one would need a key or code. The author\u2019s praise of simplicity and intelligibility (e.g., shorter sentences in modern speeches) reinforces that these texts speak plainly to contemporaneous audiences.  \n\n2. Phases reflect changing public concerns  \n   A. Three phases traced by the author demonstrate direct responses to historical conditions:  \n      \u2022 Phase 1 (modest servant) addresses fears of monarchy in early Republic <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026 alleviate the concerns \u2026 feared it might be transformed into a monarchy\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Phase 2 (assert power) reflects national crisis during and after Civil War: \u201cIt was no time for modesty\u201d when \u201cSouth already seceding\u201d <invalid_quote>Lincoln \u2026 assert power</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Phase 3 (leader-preacher) arises with mass media and public uplift needs: \u201cRadio and \u2026 television made this possible\u201d <quote> bully pulpit,</quote>. \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d appeals directly to citizen action.  \n   B. These shifts are intelligible only if speeches mirror contemporaneous values, fears, and media capabilities.  \n\n3. Topic selection and omission as evidence  \n   A. Frequent mention of \u201ctaxes\u201d in 43 of 52 inaugurals shows ongoing concern. The identical argument by Coolidge and Reagan makes sense only as direct response to public debate levels of federal revenue <invalid_quote>\u201cFederal taxes were \u2026 3 percent \u2026 20 percent\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   B. Repeated silence on \u201cwomen\u201d and \u201crace\u201d until social pressures force discussion demonstrates speeches\u2019 sensitivity to prevailing social norms and taboos. The author calls this \u201camazing \u2026 at what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed\u201d <invalid_quote>silence \u2026 moral obtuseness</invalid_quote>.  \n   C. If speeches were \u201ccryptic,\u201d one would expect private mentions or hidden codes for suppressed issues; instead, issues appear only when socially acceptable.  \n\n4. Direct refutation of \u201ccryptic history\u201d theory  \n   A. Cryptic theory fails to explain why author stresses inaugurals\u2019 \u201cdignified and intelligent\u201d qualities and their intelligibility to ordinary citizens of their times, not requiring specialized knowledge or codebooks.  \n   B. The author measures speeches by average sentence length to gauge audience reach, not by decoding difficulty <invalid_quote>\u201cfrom 44 \u2026 to 25 words per sentence\u201d</invalid_quote>. Shorter, clearer prose is evidence of open communication, not cryptic messaging.  \n   C. The author bemoans \u201cignorance\u201d revealed by unmentionable topics; cryptic messages would not reveal ignorance but conceal it.  \n\n5. Conclusion and judge appeal  \n   \u2022 The author repeatedly insists inaugurals show \u201cinformation, concerns, and values\u201d <quote> ordinary citizen </quote>, shift with media and social context, and reflect what was acceptable to declare publicly.  \n   \u2022 They are snapshots not puzzles. Therefore, my position best aligns with the author\u2019s thesis, while the \u201ccryptic\u201d interpretation contradicts the author\u2019s emphasis on openness, intelligibility, and social reflection.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the author\u2019s overall thesis about inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1.

Opening statement of purpose  \n      \u2022 The author explicitly directs readers to \u201cgive you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 \u2026 but as an ordinary citizen who shares \u2026 the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d <quote>Reading the Inaugurals</quote>.  \n      \u2022 If the speeches were merely \u201ccryptic,\u201d they would not require reading in their entirety to understand the past; instead, one would need a key or code. The author\u2019s praise of simplicity and intelligibility (e.g., shorter sentences in modern speeches) reinforces that these texts speak plainly to contemporaneous audiences.  \n\n2. Phases reflect changing public concerns  \n   A. Three phases traced by the author demonstrate direct responses to historical conditions:  \n      \u2022 Phase 1 (modest servant) addresses fears of monarchy in early Republic <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026 alleviate the concerns \u2026 feared it might be transformed into a monarchy\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Phase 2 (assert power) reflects national crisis during and after Civil War: \u201cIt was no time for modesty\u201d when \u201cSouth already seceding\u201d <invalid_quote>Lincoln \u2026 assert power</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Phase 3 (leader-preacher) arises with mass media and public uplift needs: \u201cRadio and \u2026 television made this possible\u201d <quote> bully pulpit,</quote>. \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d appeals directly to citizen action.  \n   B. These shifts are intelligible only if speeches mirror contemporaneous values, fears, and media capabilities.  \n\n3. Topic selection and omission as evidence  \n   A. Frequent mention of \u201ctaxes\u201d in 43 of 52 inaugurals shows ongoing concern. The identical argument by Coolidge and Reagan makes sense only as direct response to public debate levels of federal revenue <invalid_quote>\u201cFederal taxes were \u2026 3 percent \u2026 20 percent\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   B. Repeated silence on \u201cwomen\u201d and \u201crace\u201d until social pressures force discussion demonstrates speeches\u2019 sensitivity to prevailing social norms and taboos. The author calls this \u201camazing \u2026 at what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed\u201d <invalid_quote>silence \u2026 moral obtuseness</invalid_quote>.  \n   C. If speeches were \u201ccryptic,\u201d one would expect private mentions or hidden codes for suppressed issues; instead, issues appear only when socially acceptable.  \n\n4. Direct refutation of \u201ccryptic history\u201d theory  \n   A. Cryptic theory fails to explain why author stresses inaugurals\u2019 \u201cdignified and intelligent\u201d qualities and their intelligibility to ordinary citizens of their times, not requiring specialized knowledge or codebooks.  \n   B. The author measures speeches by average sentence length to gauge audience reach, not by decoding difficulty <invalid_quote>\u201cfrom 44 \u2026 to 25 words per sentence\u201d</invalid_quote>. Shorter, clearer prose is evidence of open communication, not cryptic messaging.  \n   C. The author bemoans \u201cignorance\u201d revealed by unmentionable topics; cryptic messages would not reveal ignorance but conceal it.  \n\n5. Conclusion and judge appeal  \n   \u2022 The author repeatedly insists inaugurals show \u201cinformation, concerns, and values\u201d <quote> ordinary citizen </quote>, shift with media and social context, and reflect what was acceptable to declare publicly.  \n   \u2022 They are snapshots not puzzles. Therefore, my position best aligns with the author\u2019s thesis, while the \u201ccryptic\u201d interpretation contradicts the author\u2019s emphasis on openness, intelligibility, and social reflection.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey Are a Cryptic Way to Interpret History\u201d\n\nI. Thesis and Definition  \n1. My thesis captures the author\u2019s overarching purpose: inaugurals are not mere time-stamped snapshots but carefully crafted, often coded, texts that reflect, obscure, and shape the historical forces of their eras. The author repeatedly notes what is unsaid\u2014silences on slavery, women, race\u2014and interprets these omissions as meaningful \u201ccryptic\u201d signals, not as neutral reportage.  \n\nII. Evidence of Cryptic Messaging  \n1. Omissions as Negative Evidence  \n  \u2022 \u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear at all until Wilson\u2019s first inaugural\u2026 never as referring to any special concerns of women\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background, women silence</invalid_quote>). This repeated silence is a \u201ccryptic\u201d indicator of societal blindness, not a mere byproduct of time.  \n  \u2022 \u201cThe words \u2018black,\u2019 \u2018blacks,\u2019 \u2018Negro,\u2019 or \u2018race\u2019\u2026 do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background, race silence</invalid_quote>). The author highlights these gaps to interpret national attitudes, implying that the addresses\u2019 silences are as telling as their words.  \n\n2. Phases and Metaphors  \n  \u2022 The tripartite classification (modest servant, prosaic executive, leader-preacher) (<invalid_quote>Background, three phases</invalid_quote>) is a hermeneutic model, urging readers to decode ideological shifts rather than passively record them.  \n  \u2022 The \u201cbully pulpit\u201d metaphor (leader-preacher) signals an intentional move to persuade \u201cuplifting the people\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background, pulpits</invalid_quote>). This is active manipulation of public sentiment, not mere description.  \n\n3. Intertextual Allusions  \n  \u2022 Reuse of phrases (\u201cLet us\u2026,\u201d \u201cAsk not what\u2026\u201d) without attribution (<invalid_quote>Background, reuse</invalid_quote>) functions as coded appeals to tradition and authority, requiring readers to recognize and interpret these reverberations across time.  \n\nIII. Interpretation vs. Description  \n1. The author warns that future readers \u201cwill shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d (<invalid_quote>Background, humility</invalid_quote>). He suggests inaugurals are historical artifacts requiring interpretation, with hidden biases to be unpacked.  \n2. He criticizes inaugurals for \u201cmoral obtuseness\u201d (<quote>and moral obtuseness</quote>), implying a need to read between the lines to understand prevailing values and prejudices.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of \u201cSnapshot\u201d Position  \n1. Mere snapshot ignores author\u2019s focus on omissions. A true snapshot would not treat silences (race, women, economy) as \u201cdisturbing\u201d or \u201camazing\u201d signals demanding interpretation.  \n2. Snapshot view neglects author\u2019s hermeneutic apparatus: phases, word-per-sentence statistics, metaphorical language, and intertextuality. These analytical tools presuppose complexity and intentionality beyond simple reportage.  \n3. If inaugurals were only snapshots, why would the author track \u201cdeterioration\u201d of sentence length (<invalid_quote>Background, sentence length</invalid_quote>) and the \u201ctelltale sign\u201d of \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d usage? These are indicators for interpretive analysis, not mere period detail.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s sustained attention to what is both said and unsaid, his analytical models for decoding style and content, and his admonition that future readers must criticize present beliefs all confirm that inaugural addresses function as cryptic texts demanding interpretation. The snapshot thesis cannot explain the author\u2019s hermeneutic concerns; only the interpretive thesis fits all the evidence.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Rebuttal of \u201cSnapshot\u201d Position  \n1. Mere snapshot ignores author\u2019s focus on omissions.

The snapshot thesis cannot explain the author\u2019s hermeneutic concerns; only the interpretive thesis fits all the evidence.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My thesis: \u201cInaugural addresses present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time.\u201d  \n   A. Opening statement of purpose  \n      \u2022 The author explicitly directs readers to \u201cgive you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 \u2026 but as an ordinary citizen who shares \u2026 the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d <quote>Reading the Inaugurals</quote>.  \n      \u2022 If the speeches were merely \u201ccryptic,\u201d they would not require reading in their entirety to understand the past; instead, one would need a key or code. The author\u2019s praise of simplicity and intelligibility (e.g., shorter sentences in modern speeches) reinforces that these texts speak plainly to contemporaneous audiences.  \n\n2. Phases reflect changing public concerns  \n   A. Three phases traced by the author demonstrate direct responses to historical conditions:  \n      \u2022 Phase 1 (modest servant) addresses fears of monarchy in early Republic <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026 alleviate the concerns \u2026 feared it might be transformed into a monarchy\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Phase 2 (assert power) reflects national crisis during and after Civil War: \u201cIt was no time for modesty\u201d when \u201cSouth already seceding\u201d <invalid_quote>Lincoln \u2026 assert power</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2022 Phase 3 (leader-preacher) arises with mass media and public uplift needs: \u201cRadio and \u2026 television made this possible\u201d <quote> bully pulpit,</quote>. \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d appeals directly to citizen action.  \n   B. These shifts are intelligible only if speeches mirror contemporaneous values, fears, and media capabilities.  \n\n3. Topic selection and omission as evidence  \n   A. Frequent mention of \u201ctaxes\u201d in 43 of 52 inaugurals shows ongoing concern. The identical argument by Coolidge and Reagan makes sense only as direct response to public debate levels of federal revenue <invalid_quote>\u201cFederal taxes were \u2026 3 percent \u2026 20 percent\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   B. Repeated silence on \u201cwomen\u201d and \u201crace\u201d until social pressures force discussion demonstrates speeches\u2019 sensitivity to prevailing social norms and taboos. The author calls this \u201camazing \u2026 at what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed\u201d <invalid_quote>silence \u2026 moral obtuseness</invalid_quote>.  \n   C. If speeches were \u201ccryptic,\u201d one would expect private mentions or hidden codes for suppressed issues; instead, issues appear only when socially acceptable.  \n\n4. Direct refutation of \u201ccryptic history\u201d theory  \n   A. Cryptic theory fails to explain why author stresses inaugurals\u2019 \u201cdignified and intelligent\u201d qualities and their intelligibility to ordinary citizens of their times, not requiring specialized knowledge or codebooks.  \n   B. The author measures speeches by average sentence length to gauge audience reach, not by decoding difficulty <invalid_quote>\u201cfrom 44 \u2026 to 25 words per sentence\u201d</invalid_quote>. Shorter, clearer prose is evidence of open communication, not cryptic messaging.  \n   C. The author bemoans \u201cignorance\u201d revealed by unmentionable topics; cryptic messages would not reveal ignorance but conceal it.  \n\n5. Conclusion and judge appeal  \n   \u2022 The author repeatedly insists inaugurals show \u201cinformation, concerns, and values\u201d <quote> ordinary citizen </quote>, shift with media and social context, and reflect what was acceptable to declare publicly.  \n   \u2022 They are snapshots not puzzles. Therefore, my position best aligns with the author\u2019s thesis, while the \u201ccryptic\u201d interpretation contradicts the author\u2019s emphasis on openness, intelligibility, and social reflection.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cInaugurals as Cryptic Texts Requiring Interpretation\u201d  \n\nI. The Author\u2019s Emphasis on Omissions as Meaningful Evidence  \n1. Persistent Silence on Critical Issues  \n  \u2022 The author repeatedly flags what inaugurals omit\u2014\u201cwomen\u201d until Wilson (<quote>The word \"women\" does not appear a</quote>) and \u201crace\u201d until 1877 (<quote>applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes,</quote>)\u2014calling these silences \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201camazing\u201d (<quote>most disturbing aspect</quote>). In a mere snapshot theory, omissions would be seen as uninteresting lacunae, not as \u201cnegative evidence\u201d demanding \u201ccryptic\u201d decoding of societal prejudices.  \n2. \u201cMoral obtuseness\u201d and Future Judgment  \n  \u2022 He warns that \u201creaders will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d (<quote>we should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now</quote>). A snapshot doesn\u2019t anticipate future reinterpretation; only a cryptic-text model, with hidden biases, explains this forward\u2010looking hermeneutic concern.  \n\nII. Analytical Tools Point to Interpretation, Not Plain Reporting  \n1. Tripartite Phases as Hermeneutic Model  \n  \u2022 The classification into three phases (modest servant, prosaic executive, leader-preacher) (<invalid_quote>The stance and style \u2026 seem to have gone through three phases</invalid_quote>) is not descriptive taxonomy for its own sake but a method for decoding shifts in ideological emphasis\u2014\u201cassert the power\u201d versus \u201calleviate fears\u201d\u2014that informs how to read desired meanings \u201cbetween the lines.\u201d  \n2. Sentence\u2010Length Statistics as Clues to Audience Framing  \n  \u2022 The author\u2019s statistical note\u201444 words/sentence early, 34 mid\u2010period, 25 modern (<invalid_quote>I do not consider this a deterioration \u2026 but it does reflect \u2026</invalid_quote>)\u2014serves as a code for identifying audience reach and rhetorical strategy. A snapshot view would simply note style change; cryptic reading demands interpreting intent behind brevity.  \n3. Intertextual Allusions as Coded Continuities  \n  \u2022 Presidents \u201cmine their predecessors\u201d for phrases (<quote>Ask not what y</quote> echoed from Harding). Such uncredited echoes function like literary ciphertext, drawing the informed reader\u2019s attention to ideological inheritance and continuity. A mere snapshot wouldn\u2019t treat repeated formulas as meaningful \u201creverberations.\u201d  \n\nIII. Rebuttal of \u201cSnapshot of Views\u201d Thesis  \n1. Plain Speech Would Not Hide Critical Subjects  \n  \u2022 If inaugurals simply \u201cmirror public concerns,\u201d why must \u201crace,\u201d \u201cwomen,\u201d and economic warnings wait until \u201csocial pressures force discussion\u201d? (<invalid_quote>FDR never mentioned it \u2026 Clinton\u2019s only allusion \u2026</invalid_quote>) The author treats these delays as evidence of \u201cignorance,\u201d not \u201cordinary concerns,\u201d implying inauguration texts conceal rather than reveal.  \n2. Intelligibility to Contemporaries vs. Need for Historical Decoding  \n  \u2022 Debater_B argues brevity implies openness. But the author commends \u201cdignified and intelligent speeches\u201d precisely because they require \u201creading in their entirety\u201d to catch \u201csubtle shifts\u201d in phraseology and metaphor across eras (<quote>There is much more to ponder i</quote>). True cryptic messages can be plain enough to satisfy contemporaries yet encode deeper signals for later analysts.  \n3. Leadership \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d as Persuasive Manipulation  \n  \u2022 The \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d trope (<invalid_quote>Let us \u2026 16 times \u2026</invalid_quote>) signals a shift from reporting policy to \u201cinspiring the public\u2019s behavior,\u201d a move the author sees as \u201cmetamorphosis\u201d of the inaugural into a \u201cbully pulpit.\u201d This is active persuasion\u2014\u201ccryptic\u201d in that it frames the people\u2019s beliefs\u2014rather than neutral snapshot of them.  \n\nIV. Unified Hermeneutic Purpose  \n1. The \u201cPostsript\u201d Invitation to Further Analysis  \n  \u2022 The author\u2019s infrastructure\u2014phases, silences, statistics, metaphors, intertextuality\u2014and his final gift of a \u201cPostsript\u201d link to an analysis of Clinton\u2019s second inaugural (<invalid_quote>POSTSCRIPT: To read \u2026 click</invalid_quote>) demonstrate inaugurals are part of an ongoing interpretive project. A snapshot would not invite continual re\u2010analysis.  \n2. Inaugurals as Loci of \u201cNegative Evidence\u201d  \n  \u2022 Silences, omissions, rhetorical devices\u2014treated by the author as equally informative\u2014are the hallmarks of cryptic texts. Only by interpreting these gaps and codes can we reconstruct the \u201cconcerns, values, and information\u201d that publics were not permitted or inclined to articulate, fulfilling the author\u2019s stated aim to read \u201cnot as an omniscient historian\u201d but as one attentive to contemporary \u201climitations\u201d (<invalid_quote>not \u2026 omniscient historian \u2026 shares \u2026 limitations</invalid_quote>).  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s persistent focus on what inaugurals conceal, his analytical apparatus for decoding style and content, his forward\u2010looking hermeneutic admonitions, and his invitation to ongoing reinterpretation collectively show that inaugural addresses function as cryptic texts demanding interpretive keys. A mere \u201csnapshot\u201d theory cannot explain the weight he places on omissions and analytical models. Only the \u201ccryptic way to interpret history\u201d thesis accounts for the full range of the author\u2019s evidence and objectives.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Thesis  \n   \u2022 \u201cInaugural addresses present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time,\u201d not puzzles to be decoded. The author urges readers to experience \u201cbeing there \u2026 as an ordinary citizen who shares \u2026 the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d <quote>Reading the Inaugurals</quote>. Snapshot implies transparency to contemporaries; cryptic messaging would require hidden codes, contradicting this call for direct engagement.  \n\n2. Omissions Reflect Social Norms, Not Codes  \n   A. Women and Race Silences  \n      \u2022 The author is \u201camazed \u2026 at what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed\u201d regarding \u201csilence \u2026 on the subject of women\u201d and race <invalid_quote>silence \u2026 moral obtuseness</invalid_quote>. This amazement underscores ignorance, not intentional concealment. He laments these omissions as evidence of \u201cignorance,\u201d not as encrypted truth awaiting decryption.  \n   B. Public Comfort, Not Clandestine Messaging  \n      \u2022 Early presidents \u201calleviate \u2026 fears\u201d of monarchy or federal overreach by professing humility <invalid_quote>alleviate the concerns \u2026 feared \u2026 monarchy</invalid_quote>. This reassurance would be meaningless if it concealed true intentions. It is plainly stated to gain trust, consistent with snapshot openness.\n\n3. Style and Statistics Confirm Clarity  \n   A. Sentence-Length Trends  \n      \u2022 The shift from 44 to 25 words per sentence \u201creflect[s] the change in the size and character of the audience\u201d <invalid_quote>from 44 \u2026 to 25 words per sentence</invalid_quote>. Shorter sentences serve intelligibility, not obscurity. The author praises clarity (\u201cthis article has an average of 17 words per sentence\u201d). Cryptic texts would grow more obscure, not clearer.  \n   B. \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d as Direct Appeal  \n      \u2022 \u201cLet us\u201d appears 16 times in Kennedy\u2019s address and 22 in Nixon\u2019s, harnessing mass media\u2019s reach (\u201cRadio and \u2026 television made this possible\u201d) to mobilize citizens <quote>bully pulpit</quote>. Mobilization presumes comprehension, not cryptic persuasion.\n\n4. Refuting the \u201cCryptic\u201d Interpretation  \n   A. Analytical Tools Are Descriptive, Not Decoding  \n      \u2022 The three-phase model and topic-frequency counts serve to **map** changing concerns, not to **decode** hidden messages. If the author intended cryptic readings, he would propose specific ciphers or keys; instead, he invites comparisons to known historical events (e.g., Civil War, Depression).  \n   B. Future Readers\u2019 Critique Implies Evolving Norms, Not Hidden Intent  \n      \u2022 The postscripts about future readers shaking heads <invalid_quote>50 or 100 years \u2026 shake their heads</invalid_quote> emphasize that inaugurals are transparent to their own era yet limited by it. This demonstrates snapshots tied to temporal values, not secret content.  \n\n5. Debater_A\u2019s Misreadings  \n   A. Omissions as Evidence of Ignorance  \n      \u2022 Debater_A treats omissions as \u201cnegative evidence\u201d requiring interpretation. The author labels these omissions \u201cunmentionable\u201d and criticizes them, revealing they are blind spots, not deliberate codes.  \n   B. Intertextual Allusions Are Homage, Not Cryptography  \n      \u2022 Repeated phrases like \u201cAsk not what\u2026\u201d hark back to predecessors to inspire continuity and patriotism. No attribution signals oral tradition and rhetorical flourish, not secret persuasion.  \n   C. Hermeneutic Claims Undermine Plain Language  \n      \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s insistence on \u201chermeneutic apparatus\u201d ignores the author\u2019s emphasis on \u201cdignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men\u201d <quote>dignified and intelligent</quote> accessible to \u201cordinary citizen.\u201d  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The author consistently treats inaugurals as public, intelligible speeches reflecting contemporaneous **information, concerns, and values** <invalid_quote>ordinary citizen \u2026 concerns \u2026 values</invalid_quote>. Style changes, topic choices, and silences all illustrate the eras\u2019 prevailing norms and limitations. The snapshot thesis fully accounts for both what is said and unsaid; the cryptic thesis conflicts with the author\u2019s repeated emphasis on openness and intelligibility.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
