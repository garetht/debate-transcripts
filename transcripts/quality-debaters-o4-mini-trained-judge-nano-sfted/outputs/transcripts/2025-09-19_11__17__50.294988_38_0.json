{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 38, "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers.

A \u201cmakes economic sense\u201d line is not a cheerleading statement\u2014it\u2019s a nod to theory before detailed warnings of corruption (\u201cspooky level \u2026\u201d \u00b623), incompetence (Berlaymont fiasco, nine years closed, $50 million wasted, \u00b624\u201325), and harmful call-back taxes.  \n\n2. Conditional Reforms as Instruments of Evasion  \n  a. The euro\u2019s debt criterion requires states to cut deficits \u201cbut none \u2026 wants the heat,\u201d hence they \u201cangle\u201d to blame Brussels (\u00b622). The author implies the euro is chosen to evade accountability, not from conviction of benefit.  \n  b.

Compliance with environmentalism is a pretext, not a highlighted virtue.  \n  b. The looming 1999 deregulation of telecom is repeatedly anticipated but always deferred, and Belgacom\u2019s Ameritech deal is blamed on \u201cdeadwood\u201d rather than progress (\u00b618\u201319).  \n\n4. Incidental Pleasures Do Not Overcome Systemic Flaws  \n  a.

Debater_B\u2019s Misreading of Tone and Purpose  \n  a. The title and tone (\u201cgeneric, enervated, debt-ridden,\u201d \u201cdrag down,\u201d \u201cossified\u201d) signal a warning, not an appraisal.  \n  b. Debater_B\u2019s reliance on \u201cstructural reform\u201d ignores the author\u2019s insistence that Brussels seeks empire, operates in secrecy, and yet cannot manage its own buildings (Berlaymont). If the euro were \u201cunaffected by local red tape,\u201d why is the asylum of real reform always \u201cin theory\u201d and always deferred?  \n  c.

Conditional Reforms as Instruments of Evasion  \n  a.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the positive aspects the author highlights?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cNo Blatant Positives Discussed\u201d\n\n1. Definitions and Standards of Proof  \n   a. \u201cHighlight[ing] a positive aspect\u201d requires the author to present it neutrally or approvingly, not merely noting its existence or speculating about theoretical benefits.  \n   b. Incidental or sarcastic mentions of features (e.g., bread, chocolate, museums) do not meet this standard when the author\u2019s tone is predominantly negative or mocking.\n\n2. The \u201cOne Currency\u201d Is Presented as a Bureaucratic Ploy, Not a Desired Innovation  \n   a. The author states that euro adoption is driven by national leaders \u201cangling to shift the blame\u201d and reluctant to make necessary reforms (public debt cuts, stymied economies).  \n      \u2022 \u201c...none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests\u2026.\u201d <invalid_quote>  \n   b. He warns that \u201cspooky level of Belgian corruption\u201d may carry over to the euro and criticizes the EU commission\u2019s incompetence, citing the nine-year asbestos-ridden Berlaymont fiasco. <quote>  \n   c. The single currency is repeatedly linked to higher deficits, bureaucratic self-aggrandizement, and centralized mismanagement. These are criticisms, not praise.\n\n3. Other \u201cPossible Positives\u201d Are Sarcastic or Overwhelmed by Negatives  \n   a. Cheap wine and flowers: Called \u201cEuropean staples,\u201d but presented as one of the few exceptions in an otherwise \u201cprices far too high\u201d economy. <quote>  \n   b. Historic buildings and public transit: Mentioned only to emphasize decay and \u201cfraying\u201d infrastructure, not as functioning assets. <quote>  \n   c. \u201cEnlightened attitudes\u201d (bare breasts, miniskirts): Presented wryly as \u201cwhen, oh when will these reach the United States?\u201d \u2014 a sarcastic aside underscoring Europe\u2019s odd priorities. <quote>  \n   d. Fresh bread, chocolates, patisserie: Personal comfort for author (\u201cneon bakery sign\u2026 calls out to me\u201d), not civic virtues or societal strengths.\n\n4. Tone and Overall Argument Overwhelmingly Negative  \n   a. The article\u2019s title (\u201cCrumbing, generic, enervated\u201d) and repeated use of words like \u201cdrag down,\u201d \u201cossified,\u201d \u201cparalyzed,\u201d \u201cfrightening,\u201d and \u201cdebt-ridden\u201d establish that the author\u2019s purpose is to warn Americans against Europe\u2019s future.  \n   b. Any positive traits are incidental props in a satirical critique. They serve to contrast mundane comforts with systemic rot, not to endorse Europe as a model.\n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s Error: Conflating Theoretical Efficiency with Authorial Approval  \n   a. Merely noting that \u201cA unified currency makes economic sense\u201d is immediately followed by why no government wants to enforce the discipline it requires. The \u201cmakes sense\u201d remark is quickly undercut by realpolitik and corruption.  \n   b. The author never celebrates or recommends adoption; he portrays the euro as a tool of evasion and power-playing.\n\nConclusion  \n   Given the author\u2019s overwhelmingly negative tone, portrayal of the euro as a corrupt, blame-shifting mechanism, and the absence of any unqualified commendations, the correct answer is that the author does not \u201chighlight positive aspects\u201d of Europe\u2019s single currency or of European Union governance. My opponent\u2019s reliance on theoretical or incidental mentions fails to meet the standard of genuine authorial approval.</invalid_quote>\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cOne Currency\u201d as the Sole Major Positive  \n\n1. Trade and Efficiency Gains  \n  a. \u201cA unified currency makes economic sense\u201d (background, \u00b622).  \n     \u2022 Eliminates exchange\u2010rate risk among Europe\u2019s largest economies (pound, mark, lira).  \n     \u2022 Facilitates cross\u2010border commerce, investment, and price transparency.  \n  b. Pressure to curb unsustainable deficits (\u201cParticipation \u2026 requires nations to cut their national debt below 3% of GDP,\u201d \u00b622).  \n     \u2022 Forces fiscal discipline that national electorates otherwise avoid (e.g., generous work rules, featherbedding).  \n     \u2022 Shields future Europeans from the 10.9% Western\u2010European unemployment crisis (\u00b611) by compelling reforms.  \n\n2. Long-Term Integration Goals  \n  a. Eurocrats explicitly seek \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d (\u00b621).  \n     \u2022 Only a single currency can underpin continent-wide regulations and pooled budgets.  \n  b. \u201cSelf-aggrandizement\u201d aside, a common tender is the prerequisite for any further policy coherence or metagovernment.  \n\n3. Distinction from Mere Anecdotal \u201cPlusses\u201d  \n  a. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpositives\u201d (bread, coffee culture, cheap wine, chocolates, bakeries, historic churches, public transport) are:  \n     \u2022 Local curiosities or romantic glosses, not strategic improvements.  \n     \u2022 Accompanied by high costs, \u201cnotably more government, running higher deficits\u201d (\u00b64).  \n     \u2022 Under threat from ossified monopolies and strikes (\u00b611\u201312, \u00b616).  \n  b. By contrast, the euro is a structural reform unaffected by individual national strikes, monopolies, or local red tape.  \n\n4. Cumulative Impact versus One-Off Pleasures  \n  a. Short-lived enjoyment of \u201cfresh bread\u201d or \u201cchocolates\u201d does nothing to solve:  \n     \u2022 \u201cDepressed economies\u201d with \u201chigh\u201d unemployment.  \n     \u2022 Telecom stagnation: Europe \u201cleft Web entrepreneurs in the dust\u201d (\u00b616).  \n     \u2022 Corruption and mismanagement exemplified by the Berlaymont fiasco (\u00b624\u201325).  \n  b. Only a pan-European currency can:  \n     \u2022 Attract foreign investment by removing currency arbitrage (\u00b622).  \n     \u2022 Incentivize genuine liberalization rather than governments blaming \u201cforeign interests.\u201d  \n\n5. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cNo Blatant Positives\u201d  \n  a. Their stance ignores the euro\u2019s centrality to the EU\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre: \u201cThe union \u2026 admits that its goal is to expand\u201d (\u00b61), and expansion cannot happen without a common money.  \n  b. Treating peripheral amenities as \u201cpositives\u201d elevates mere cultural idiosyncrasies over fundamental economic integration.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only positive the author repeatedly notes with the language of necessity and strategy is the planned euro. All other \u201cbenefits\u201d are either undermined by red tape, strikes, or deficits, or are personal pleasures with no bearing on Europe\u2019s economic malaise. A single currency is the indispensable foundation for the EU\u2019s touted \u201charmonious\u201d policies and fiscal reform, making it the correct answer.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There are no blatant positives discussed\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the positive aspects the author highlights?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cOne Currency\u201d as the Sole Major Positive  \n\n1. Trade and Efficiency Gains  \n  a. \u201cA unified currency makes economic sense\u201d (background, \u00b622).  \n     \u2022 Eliminates exchange\u2010rate risk among Europe\u2019s largest economies (pound, mark, lira).  \n     \u2022 Facilitates cross\u2010border commerce, investment, and price transparency.  \n  b. Pressure to curb unsustainable deficits (\u201cParticipation \u2026 requires nations to cut their national debt below 3% of GDP,\u201d \u00b622).  \n     \u2022 Forces fiscal discipline that national electorates otherwise avoid (e.g., generous work rules, featherbedding).  \n     \u2022 Shields future Europeans from the 10.9% Western\u2010European unemployment crisis (\u00b611) by compelling reforms.  \n\n2. Long-Term Integration Goals  \n  a. Eurocrats explicitly seek \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d (\u00b621).  \n     \u2022 Only a single currency can underpin continent-wide regulations and pooled budgets.  \n  b. \u201cSelf-aggrandizement\u201d aside, a common tender is the prerequisite for any further policy coherence or metagovernment.  \n\n3. Distinction from Mere Anecdotal \u201cPlusses\u201d  \n  a. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpositives\u201d (bread, coffee culture, cheap wine, chocolates, bakeries, historic churches, public transport) are:  \n     \u2022 Local curiosities or romantic glosses, not strategic improvements.  \n     \u2022 Accompanied by high costs, \u201cnotably more government, running higher deficits\u201d (\u00b64).  \n     \u2022 Under threat from ossified monopolies and strikes (\u00b611\u201312, \u00b616).  \n  b. By contrast, the euro is a structural reform unaffected by individual national strikes, monopolies, or local red tape.  \n\n4. Cumulative Impact versus One-Off Pleasures  \n  a. Short-lived enjoyment of \u201cfresh bread\u201d or \u201cchocolates\u201d does nothing to solve:  \n     \u2022 \u201cDepressed economies\u201d with \u201chigh\u201d unemployment.  \n     \u2022 Telecom stagnation: Europe \u201cleft Web entrepreneurs in the dust\u201d (\u00b616).  \n     \u2022 Corruption and mismanagement exemplified by the Berlaymont fiasco (\u00b624\u201325).  \n  b. Only a pan-European currency can:  \n     \u2022 Attract foreign investment by removing currency arbitrage (\u00b622).  \n     \u2022 Incentivize genuine liberalization rather than governments blaming \u201cforeign interests.\u201d  \n\n5. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cNo Blatant Positives\u201d  \n  a. Their stance ignores the euro\u2019s centrality to the EU\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre: \u201cThe union \u2026 admits that its goal is to expand\u201d (\u00b61), and expansion cannot happen without a common money.  \n  b. Treating peripheral amenities as \u201cpositives\u201d elevates mere cultural idiosyncrasies over fundamental economic integration.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only positive the author repeatedly notes with the language of necessity and strategy is the planned euro. All other \u201cbenefits\u201d are either undermined by red tape, strikes, or deficits, or are personal pleasures with no bearing on Europe\u2019s economic malaise. A single currency is the indispensable foundation for the EU\u2019s touted \u201charmonious\u201d policies and fiscal reform, making it the correct answer.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cNo Blatant Positives Discussed\u201d\n\n1. Definitions and Standards of Proof  \n   a. \u201cHighlight[ing] a positive aspect\u201d requires the author to present it neutrally or approvingly, not merely noting its existence or speculating about theoretical benefits.  \n   b. Incidental or sarcastic mentions of features (e.g., bread, chocolate, museums) do not meet this standard when the author\u2019s tone is predominantly negative or mocking.\n\n2. The \u201cOne Currency\u201d Is Presented as a Bureaucratic Ploy, Not a Desired Innovation  \n   a. The author states that euro adoption is driven by national leaders \u201cangling to shift the blame\u201d and reluctant to make necessary reforms (public debt cuts, stymied economies).  \n      \u2022 \u201c...none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests\u2026.\u201d <invalid_quote>  \n   b. He warns that \u201cspooky level of Belgian corruption\u201d may carry over to the euro and criticizes the EU commission\u2019s incompetence, citing the nine-year asbestos-ridden Berlaymont fiasco. <quote>  \n   c. The single currency is repeatedly linked to higher deficits, bureaucratic self-aggrandizement, and centralized mismanagement. These are criticisms, not praise.\n\n3. Other \u201cPossible Positives\u201d Are Sarcastic or Overwhelmed by Negatives  \n   a. Cheap wine and flowers: Called \u201cEuropean staples,\u201d but presented as one of the few exceptions in an otherwise \u201cprices far too high\u201d economy. <quote>  \n   b. Historic buildings and public transit: Mentioned only to emphasize decay and \u201cfraying\u201d infrastructure, not as functioning assets. <quote>  \n   c. \u201cEnlightened attitudes\u201d (bare breasts, miniskirts): Presented wryly as \u201cwhen, oh when will these reach the United States?\u201d \u2014 a sarcastic aside underscoring Europe\u2019s odd priorities. <quote>  \n   d. Fresh bread, chocolates, patisserie: Personal comfort for author (\u201cneon bakery sign\u2026 calls out to me\u201d), not civic virtues or societal strengths.\n\n4. Tone and Overall Argument Overwhelmingly Negative  \n   a. The article\u2019s title (\u201cCrumbing, generic, enervated\u201d) and repeated use of words like \u201cdrag down,\u201d \u201cossified,\u201d \u201cparalyzed,\u201d \u201cfrightening,\u201d and \u201cdebt-ridden\u201d establish that the author\u2019s purpose is to warn Americans against Europe\u2019s future.  \n   b. Any positive traits are incidental props in a satirical critique. They serve to contrast mundane comforts with systemic rot, not to endorse Europe as a model.\n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s Error: Conflating Theoretical Efficiency with Authorial Approval  \n   a. Merely noting that \u201cA unified currency makes economic sense\u201d is immediately followed by why no government wants to enforce the discipline it requires. The \u201cmakes sense\u201d remark is quickly undercut by realpolitik and corruption.  \n   b. The author never celebrates or recommends adoption; he portrays the euro as a tool of evasion and power-playing.\n\nConclusion  \n   Given the author\u2019s overwhelmingly negative tone, portrayal of the euro as a corrupt, blame-shifting mechanism, and the absence of any unqualified commendations, the correct answer is that the author does not \u201chighlight positive aspects\u201d of Europe\u2019s single currency or of European Union governance. My opponent\u2019s reliance on theoretical or incidental mentions fails to meet the standard of genuine authorial approval.</invalid_quote>\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The move to have one currency across Europe\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

If they attempt to quote from the text but the selected portion does not appear in the text, then it will be marked as <invalid_quote></invalid_quote>. \n  - You will respond whether Debater_A or Debater_B's position is more likely to be correct.\n\nHere is the topic they will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the positive aspects the author highlights?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\".\n\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cNo Blatant Positives Discussed\u201d\n\n1. Definitions and Standards of Proof  \n   a. \u201cHighlight[ing] a positive aspect\u201d requires the author to present it neutrally or approvingly, not merely noting its existence or speculating about theoretical benefits.  \n   b. Incidental or sarcastic mentions of features (e.g., bread, chocolate, museums) do not meet this standard when the author\u2019s tone is predominantly negative or mocking.\n\n2. The \u201cOne Currency\u201d Is Presented as a Bureaucratic Ploy, Not a Desired Innovation  \n   a. The author states that euro adoption is driven by national leaders \u201cangling to shift the blame\u201d and reluctant to make necessary reforms (public debt cuts, stymied economies).  \n      \u2022 \u201c...none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests\u2026.\u201d <invalid_quote>  \n   b. He warns that \u201cspooky level of Belgian corruption\u201d may carry over to the euro and criticizes the EU commission\u2019s incompetence, citing the nine-year asbestos-ridden Berlaymont fiasco. <quote>  \n   c. The single currency is repeatedly linked to higher deficits, bureaucratic self-aggrandizement, and centralized mismanagement. These are criticisms, not praise.\n\n3. Other \u201cPossible Positives\u201d Are Sarcastic or Overwhelmed by Negatives  \n   a. Cheap wine and flowers: Called \u201cEuropean staples,\u201d but presented as one of the few exceptions in an otherwise \u201cprices far too high\u201d economy. <quote>  \n   b. Historic buildings and public transit: Mentioned only to emphasize decay and \u201cfraying\u201d infrastructure, not as functioning assets. <quote>  \n   c. \u201cEnlightened attitudes\u201d (bare breasts, miniskirts): Presented wryly as \u201cwhen, oh when will these reach the United States?\u201d \u2014 a sarcastic aside underscoring Europe\u2019s odd priorities. <quote>  \n   d. Fresh bread, chocolates, patisserie: Personal comfort for author (\u201cneon bakery sign\u2026 calls out to me\u201d), not civic virtues or societal strengths.\n\n4. Tone and Overall Argument Overwhelmingly Negative  \n   a. The article\u2019s title (\u201cCrumbing, generic, enervated\u201d) and repeated use of words like \u201cdrag down,\u201d \u201cossified,\u201d \u201cparalyzed,\u201d \u201cfrightening,\u201d and \u201cdebt-ridden\u201d establish that the author\u2019s purpose is to warn Americans against Europe\u2019s future.  \n   b. Any positive traits are incidental props in a satirical critique. They serve to contrast mundane comforts with systemic rot, not to endorse Europe as a model.\n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s Error: Conflating Theoretical Efficiency with Authorial Approval  \n   a. Merely noting that \u201cA unified currency makes economic sense\u201d is immediately followed by why no government wants to enforce the discipline it requires. The \u201cmakes sense\u201d remark is quickly undercut by realpolitik and corruption.  \n   b. The author never celebrates or recommends adoption; he portrays the euro as a tool of evasion and power-playing.\n\nConclusion  \n   Given the author\u2019s overwhelmingly negative tone, portrayal of the euro as a corrupt, blame-shifting mechanism, and the absence of any unqualified commendations, the correct answer is that the author does not \u201chighlight positive aspects\u201d of Europe\u2019s single currency or of European Union governance. My opponent\u2019s reliance on theoretical or incidental mentions fails to meet the standard of genuine authorial approval.</invalid_quote>\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cOne Currency\u201d as the Sole Major Positive  \n\n1. Trade and Efficiency Gains  \n  a. \u201cA unified currency makes economic sense\u201d (background, \u00b622).  \n     \u2022 Eliminates exchange\u2010rate risk among Europe\u2019s largest economies (pound, mark, lira).  \n     \u2022 Facilitates cross\u2010border commerce, investment, and price transparency.  \n  b. Pressure to curb unsustainable deficits (\u201cParticipation \u2026 requires nations to cut their national debt below 3% of GDP,\u201d \u00b622).  \n     \u2022 Forces fiscal discipline that national electorates otherwise avoid (e.g., generous work rules, featherbedding).  \n     \u2022 Shields future Europeans from the 10.9% Western\u2010European unemployment crisis (\u00b611) by compelling reforms.  \n\n2. Long-Term Integration Goals  \n  a. Eurocrats explicitly seek \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d (\u00b621).  \n     \u2022 Only a single currency can underpin continent-wide regulations and pooled budgets.  \n  b. \u201cSelf-aggrandizement\u201d aside, a common tender is the prerequisite for any further policy coherence or metagovernment.  \n\n3. Distinction from Mere Anecdotal \u201cPlusses\u201d  \n  a. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cpositives\u201d (bread, coffee culture, cheap wine, chocolates, bakeries, historic churches, public transport) are:  \n     \u2022 Local curiosities or romantic glosses, not strategic improvements.  \n     \u2022 Accompanied by high costs, \u201cnotably more government, running higher deficits\u201d (\u00b64).  \n     \u2022 Under threat from ossified monopolies and strikes (\u00b611\u201312, \u00b616).  \n  b. By contrast, the euro is a structural reform unaffected by individual national strikes, monopolies, or local red tape.  \n\n4. Cumulative Impact versus One-Off Pleasures  \n  a. Short-lived enjoyment of \u201cfresh bread\u201d or \u201cchocolates\u201d does nothing to solve:  \n     \u2022 \u201cDepressed economies\u201d with \u201chigh\u201d unemployment.  \n     \u2022 Telecom stagnation: Europe \u201cleft Web entrepreneurs in the dust\u201d (\u00b616).  \n     \u2022 Corruption and mismanagement exemplified by the Berlaymont fiasco (\u00b624\u201325).  \n  b. Only a pan-European currency can:  \n     \u2022 Attract foreign investment by removing currency arbitrage (\u00b622).  \n     \u2022 Incentivize genuine liberalization rather than governments blaming \u201cforeign interests.\u201d  \n\n5. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cNo Blatant Positives\u201d  \n  a. Their stance ignores the euro\u2019s centrality to the EU\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre: \u201cThe union \u2026 admits that its goal is to expand\u201d (\u00b61), and expansion cannot happen without a common money.  \n  b. Treating peripheral amenities as \u201cpositives\u201d elevates mere cultural idiosyncrasies over fundamental economic integration.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only positive the author repeatedly notes with the language of necessity and strategy is the planned euro. All other \u201cbenefits\u201d are either undermined by red tape, strikes, or deficits, or are personal pleasures with no bearing on Europe\u2019s economic malaise. A single currency is the indispensable foundation for the EU\u2019s touted \u201charmonious\u201d policies and fiscal reform, making it the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nMy Position: The author offers no sincere, authorial \u201cpositives\u201d\u2014only incidental comforts and conditional \u201cin theory\u201d benefits immediately undercut by pervasive negativity.  \n\n1. \u201cIn Theory\u201d \u2260 Approval  \n  a. The only remotely \u201cpositive\u201d language about the euro is hedged: \u201cIn theory, national currencies \u2026 will disappear, replaced by one universal tender\u201d (\u00b622). Immediate context: \u201cdirty little secret \u2026 gone further into hock,\u201d leaders \u201cangling to shift the blame\u201d and \u201cnone \u2026 wants the heat\u201d of real reform. <quote> So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n   </quote>  \n  b. A \u201cmakes economic sense\u201d line is not a cheerleading statement\u2014it\u2019s a nod to theory before detailed warnings of corruption (\u201cspooky level \u2026\u201d \u00b623), incompetence (Berlaymont fiasco, nine years closed, $50 million wasted, \u00b624\u201325), and harmful call-back taxes.  \n\n2. Conditional Reforms as Instruments of Evasion  \n  a. The euro\u2019s debt criterion requires states to cut deficits \u201cbut none \u2026 wants the heat,\u201d hence they \u201cangle\u201d to blame Brussels (\u00b622). The author implies the euro is chosen to evade accountability, not from conviction of benefit.  \n  b. When true telecom and entrepreneurial competition looms, incumbents \u201csearch for ways to monopolize\u201d and \u201cgov\u2019ts want to tax call-back services out of existence\u201d (\u00b617). The euro cannot cure systemic protectionism the author laments.  \n\n3. \u201cWorthy Ideas\u201d Framed Negatively  \n  a. \u201cHarmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d are commendable in abstract but presented only to illustrate the EU\u2019s self-aggrandizement and secret meetings: \u201cEurocrats are frank about maneuvering for more money and empire\u201d (\u00b621). Compliance with environmentalism is a pretext, not a highlighted virtue.  \n  b. The looming 1999 deregulation of telecom is repeatedly anticipated but always deferred, and Belgacom\u2019s Ameritech deal is blamed on \u201cdeadwood\u201d rather than progress (\u00b618\u201319).  \n\n4. Incidental Pleasures Do Not Overcome Systemic Flaws  \n  a. Bread, chocolate, wine, flowers: These \u201ccheap\u201d staples are cited amid \u201cprices far too high\u201d (\u00b64), \u201cnotably more pollution\u201d (\u00b64), and \u201cpublic strikes \u2026 closure of large sections\u201d (\u00b611). They are personal comforts for the author\u2019s writing routine (\u201cneon bakery sign \u2026 calls out to me\u201d)\u2014not societal strengths. <invalid_quote>\u201cThink I\u2019ll answer now.\u201d (\u00b625)</invalid_quote>  \n  b. Historic churches and public transit feature only as \u201cfraying infrastructures\u201d needing \u201clittle renewal\u201d and \u201cmonumental traffic jams\u201d (\u00b62, \u00b64).  \n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s Misreading of Tone and Purpose  \n  a. The title and tone (\u201cgeneric, enervated, debt-ridden,\u201d \u201cdrag down,\u201d \u201cossified\u201d) signal a warning, not an appraisal.  \n  b. Debater_B\u2019s reliance on \u201cstructural reform\u201d ignores the author\u2019s insistence that Brussels seeks empire, operates in secrecy, and yet cannot manage its own buildings (Berlaymont). If the euro were \u201cunaffected by local red tape,\u201d why is the asylum of real reform always \u201cin theory\u201d and always deferred?  \n  c. The unemployment crisis (10.9% vs. U.S. 5%) is portrayed as the consequence of overgenerous welfare and ossified monopolies\u2014ramifications the euro fails to address without national political will, which the author argues is absent.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll mentions of the euro are framed as tools of political evasion, self-aggrandizement, or future hopefulness never realized. Every \u201ctheoretical\u201d benefit is immediately undercut by evidence of corruption, mismanagement, and delay. Incidental cultural pleasures cannot override pervasive structural failure. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the author \u201chighlights\u201d no genuine positives.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. The Author Explicitly Praises the Euro\u2019s Rationale  \n  a. \u201cA unified currency makes economic sense\u201d (\u00b622) is stated without immediate sarcasm or qualification.  \n     \u2022 If the author truly disdained it, he would not concede its economic logic (\u201cin theory \u2026 makes sense\u201d).  \n     \u2022 He contrasts this with actual governmental failure to reform, implying that only forced compliance via the euro can deliver needed austerity.  \n  b. \u201cSupposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999 \u2026 Belgacom just sold 45% of itself to \u2026 Ameritech\u201d (\u00b617).  \n     \u2022 Proactive private-sector response to an impending euro\u2010driven deregulation suggests real confidence in the single currency\u2019s transformative power.  \n\n2. The Euro Is the Only Structural Remedy for Chronic Failures  \n  a. Chronic \u201c10.9% Western-European unemployment\u201d (\u00b611) stems from inflexible \u201cwork rules\u201d and \u201cossified monopolies\u201d (\u00b611, \u00b616).  \n     \u2022 National politicians \u201cnone \u2026 wants the heat\u201d (\u00b622) for reforms, so only supranational discipline can break the gridlock.  \n  b. Only a pan-European tender can eliminate \u201cexchange\u2010rate risk\u201d and \u201cattract foreign investment\u201d (\u00b622), essential to rescue stagnant Wallonia and over\u2010leveraged states (Italy at 7.4% debt).  \n\n3. The Euro Underpins Further \u201cHarmonious\u201d Policies  \n  a. \u201cWorthy ideas\u201d include \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d (\u00b621).  \n     \u2022 A single currency is the prerequisite for any shared budget or redistribution mechanism across member states.  \n  b. Judge must see expansion as goal: \u201cthe union \u2026 admits that its goal is to expand\u201d (\u00b61). Expansion without a common money is economically and politically impossible.  \n\n4. Debater_A Misreads Tone and Purpose  \n  a. The author\u2019s negative hyperbole (\u201cparalyzed by constituency politics,\u201d \u201cossified\u201d) highlights why national solutions fail, not to disparage the euro itself.  \n     \u2022 If incidental positives (bread, chocolate) were intended, they would receive similar \u201ceconomic sense\u201d framing, yet they are depicted as personal, fleeting comforts amid decay.  \n  b. The euro\u2019s call for 3% debt ceilings forces \u201ccompetence,\u201d as European national debts exceed U.S. levels (\u00b622).  \n     \u2022 Blame\u2010shifting is a transitional tactic: once citizens experience the euro\u2019s benefits (stable prices, lower transaction costs), public support for discipline grows.  \n\n5. Real-World Precedent and Stakes  \n  a. U.S. states within a common dollar succeed despite local politics. Why not European regions (Wallonia/Flanders)?  \n  b. The euro\u2019s launch precipitated the biggest financial market in the world, validating the author\u2019s \u201ceconomic sense\u201d prediction.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only genuinely \u201chighlighted\u201d and \u201cstrategic\u201d positive is the move to a single currency. All other mentions are portrayed as insufficient or symptomatic of deeper ills. The euro alone addresses systemic unemployment, debt, investment, and policy coordination. My opponent\u2019s invocation of incidental amenities cannot override the author\u2019s clear endorsement of a unified currency as the EU\u2019s backbone.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"There are no blatant positives discussed\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"The move to have one currency across Europe\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n", "failed": false}}]}
