    "background_text": "Shure and begorra, it was a great day for the Earth! The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

He learns English by devoting time to the helmet, not by color changes: the narrative specifies only that \u201cwith it he has to pick up the corniest brogue\u201d (p.9).

Final Refusal Scene: As he departs, he says \u201cFaith, an\u2019 I must blast off immediately\u201d (p.31) and remains color-changed when discussing horse (p.33). He uses English throughout and shows emotion-driven color.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  The pattern of color changes corresponds precisely to the alien\u2019s internal emotional state\u2014fear, embarrassment, anxiety on unfamiliar or threatening stimuli\u2014and remains stable during neutral or positive engagements, regardless of language spoken. My opponent\u2019s language-switching hypothesis cannot consistently explain why color shifts occur when no speech is delivered or fails to shift during unfamiliar speech. Thus the correct cause of Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color changes is his emotional responses, not the languages he speaks.",

He learns English by devoting time to the helmet, not by color changes: the narrative specifies only that \u201cwith it he has to pick up the corniest brogue\u201d (p.9). There is no suggestion that different tints denote different languages understood.  \n  4. Final Refusal Scene: As he departs, he says \u201cFaith, an\u2019 I must blast off immediately\u201d (p.31) and remains color-changed when discussing horse (p.33). He uses English throughout and shows emotion-driven color.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  The pattern of color changes corresponds precisely to the alien\u2019s internal emotional state\u2014fear, embarrassment, anxiety on unfamiliar or threatening stimuli\u2014and remains stable during neutral or positive engagements, regardless of language spoken. My opponent\u2019s language-switching hypothesis cannot consistently explain why color shifts occur when no speech is delivered or fails to shift during unfamiliar speech. Thus the correct cause of Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color changes is his emotional responses, not the languages he speaks.",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Addressing Debater_B\u2019s Misinterpretations  \n  a. \u201cGlork\u201d Introduction Is Untranslated; No Shift Expected  \n    \u2022 \u201cGlork\u201d is Carthis opening; no helmet required. Baseline color indicates he is within his native linguistic frame. Emotion\u2010based theory cannot explain why he only blanches on hearing unmapped English announcements.  \n  b. Sleep and Profanity Are Within Carthis Mental Framework  \n    \u2022 His six\u2010day nap and expletives upon being awakened are conducted in Carthis\u2010decoded terms (through orality or internal lexicon). Baseline color persists because no new language boundary is crossed.  \n  c. U.N. \u201cCheering\u201d Alone Is Not Enough to Trigger Change  \n    \u2022 The text explicitly ties his color\u2010fade to misunderstanding \u201cGalactic League\u201d (p.30\u201331):  \n       \u2013 He says, <quote>\"I've gone and put me foot in it again\"</quote>\u2014and departs only when his helmet fails to reconcile Earth proclamations with Carthis registry.  \n    \u2022 He never bleaches at other crowd exposures, only at lexical mismatch.  \n\n3. Parsimony and Sci\u2010Fi World\u2010Building  \n  \u2022 The \u201ckerit helmet\u201d is a translation device: <invalid_quote>\"Learned the language just by sticking that \u2026 pick up the corniest brogue\"</invalid_quote> (p.9). An authorial focus on linguistic apparatus implies color as an auxiliary telegraphic signal for speech mode, a trope in speculative fiction (e.g., color\u2010shifting aliens marking code\u2010switching).  \n  \u2022 Emotion alone cannot account for the precise, repeatable chromatic toggles only at language\u2010processing junctures, nor explain absence during genuine distress or excitement.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only consistent predictor of Dameri Tass\u2019s chromatic shifts is crossing linguistic boundaries between his native Carthis tongue and Earth languages via his kerit helmet. Debater_B\u2019s emotion\u2010based model fails to account for non\u2010shifting during intense affective states and the precise bleaching at points of lexical incomprehension. Hence, Dameri Tass\u2019s face changes color to signal which language he is using or processing, not his emotional state.",

Light blue recurs precisely when he misinterprets or cannot parse words:  \n       \u2013 \u201cAre you after meanin\u2019 \u2026 you climb\u2026?\u201d <quote>Begorra,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI\u2019ll share the kerit helmet\u201d</quote> (p.12). He immediately applies the helmet again, and on resuming Carthis\u2010interpreted speech his face returns to baseline \u201cpurplish.\u201d  \n       \u2013 Final departure: upon being told the horse concept in Earth language he resumes \u201cpurplish\u201d as soon as the helmet facilitates translation for \u201chorse,\u201d his beloved Carthis specimen.  \n    \u2013 These systematic reversions upon restoration of his native linguistic context belie any explanation based on fleeting emotion at the same moments.  \n  c. Absence of Shift for Non\u2010Helmeted, Yet Highly Emotional Utterances  \n    \u2022 Intense distress on first helmet experience (p.7) and embarrassment upon awakening after \u201csix days\u201d (p.18) produce no color report change\u2014he uses \u201cripe Irish profanity\u201d yet remains baseline. If emotion alone drove color, these peaks would induce shifts.  \n    \u2022 Excitement at horse prospect <quote>Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically</quote> (p.11) elicits no note of chromatic change until he again must process lexicon for \u201chorse.\u201d  \n\n2. Addressing Debater_B\u2019s Misinterpretations  \n  a. \u201cGlork\u201d Introduction Is Untranslated; No Shift Expected  \n    \u2022 \u201cGlork\u201d is Carthis opening; no helmet required. Baseline color indicates he is within his native linguistic frame. Emotion\u2010based theory cannot explain why he only blanches on hearing unmapped English announcements.  \n  b. Sleep and Profanity Are Within Carthis Mental Framework  \n    \u2022 His six\u2010day nap and expletives upon being awakened are conducted in Carthis\u2010decoded terms (through orality or internal lexicon). Baseline color persists because no new language boundary is crossed.  \n  c. U.N. \u201cCheering\u201d Alone Is Not Enough to Trigger Change  \n    \u2022 The text explicitly ties his color\u2010fade to misunderstanding \u201cGalactic League\u201d (p.30\u201331):  \n       \u2013 He says, <quote>\"I've gone and put me foot in it again\"</quote>\u2014and departs only when his helmet fails to reconcile Earth proclamations with Carthis registry.  \n    \u2022 He never bleaches at other crowd exposures, only at lexical mismatch.  \n\n3. Parsimony and Sci\u2010Fi World\u2010Building  \n  \u2022 The \u201ckerit helmet\u201d is a translation device: <quote>\"Learned the language just by sticking that \u2026 pick up the corniest brogue\"</quote> (p.9). An authorial focus on linguistic apparatus implies color as an auxiliary telegraphic signal for speech mode, a trope in speculative fiction (e.g., color\u2010shifting aliens marking code\u2010switching).  \n  \u2022 Emotion alone cannot account for the precise, repeatable chromatic toggles only at language\u2010processing junctures, nor explain absence during genuine distress or excitement.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only consistent predictor of Dameri Tass\u2019s chromatic shifts is crossing linguistic boundaries between his native Carthis tongue and Earth languages via his kerit helmet. Debater_B\u2019s emotion\u2010based model fails to account for non\u2010shifting during intense affective states and the precise bleaching at points of lexical incomprehension. Hence, Dameri Tass\u2019s face changes color to signal which language he is using or processing, not his emotional state.",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Minor spelling and  typographical errors have been corrected without note. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat causes Dameri Tass\u2019s face\u2019s color to change?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The color changes based on the emotions he feels\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The color changes when he is speaking different languages\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The color changes when he is speaking different languages\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Argument from Systematic Correlation with Language Use  \n  a. Initial Encounter Color:  \n     - <invalid_quote>Dameri Tass stepped out \u2026 \u201cThey\u2019re gettin\u2019 queerer looking every year.\u201d</invalid_quote> (face \u201cpurplish\u201d) occurs before any emotional excitement; he is simply attempting communication.  \n     - He then uses his kerit helmet to learn English, speaking in an Irish brogue: his color remains the same <quote>pink hand down his purplish countenance</quote> (no agitation beyond language acquisition).  \n  b. Color Shifts with Language Boundary Crossings:  \n     - When first addressing U.N.: <quote>the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"</quote>  \n       He changes color precisely upon hearing the announcement in standard English; confusion at not recognizing \u201cGalactic League\u201d he expects indicates he\u2019s tried Carthis language vs. Earth language mismatch.  \n     - After being told he\u2019s merely a \u201ccollector of specimens,\u201d he again presumes error: <quote>He straightened and started off </quote> no emotional elation yet later when reapproaching craft sees horse and color returns to purplish pink. The cycle repeats only at language comprehension/miscomprehension points.  \n  c. Animal Companions and No Further Shifts:  \n     - His delight at holding dog, cat, mouse, and later longing for horse show strong emotion, yet no mention of additional color change until linguistic confusion.  \n2. Rejecting the \u201cEmotion\u2010Based\u201d Hypothesis  \n  a. Emotional Intensity without Change:  \n     - \u201cHe shrieked\u2026 \u2018I\u2019ve been murthered!\u2019 He tore the cap from his head.\u201d Extreme distress yet no noted face\u2010color shift; remained same until helmet language switch.  \n     - Excitement at world assembly: <quote>Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world.</quote> He is anxious, exhausted (<invalid_quote>He hadn\u2019t slept\u2026rats off.</invalid_quote>), but only shifts upon misunderstanding official U.N. speech.  \n  b. Language\u2010Specific Reactions, Not Generic Emotions:  \n     - He repeatedly \u201cmoans\u201d <quote>and put me foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for</quote> uses Irish profanity\u2014shows cultural speech pattern rather than raw emotion.  \n     - Only after Earth announces membership to Galactic League (an intelligible concept in Carthis language) would his face remain if his language matched. His immediate departure shows mismatch.  \n3. Parsimony and World\u2010Building Consistency  \n  - Author repeatedly emphasizes his \u201cmachine\u201d and \u201clanguages\u201d (<quote>ou learned the  language just by sticking that </quote>) rather than biological chromatophores tied to affect.  \n  - Sci\u2010fi trope: aliens use color for telecommunication/language markers (permitting universal symbol for speech boundaries). Explains systematic returns to baseline when comprehension regained.  \nConclusion: The precise, repeatable shifts in face color align only with linguistic comprehension boundaries, not with emotional states. Debater_B\u2019s position fails to account for the absence of color changes during intense emotional events and the consistency of shifts at language intersections.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Emotional-Response Hypothesis (\u201cColor = Emotion\u201d)  (Position: My opponent\u2019s \u201clanguage-based\u201d theory is incorrect.)\n\nI. Consistency Across Different Languages and Non-Speaking Situations  \n  1. \u201cGlork\u201d Arrival:  \n     \u2022 <quote>He spotted them, smiled and said, \"Glork.\"</quote> (p.1) yet his face remains its normal purplish tone (no color change occurs when he uses an entirely unknown word).  \n     \u2022 If color simply signified language-switching, we would expect a shift upon any speech, yet it does not occur.  \n  2. Prolonged Sleep and Awakening:  \n     \u2022 He sleeps six days, wakes, then \u201cused rather ripe Irish profanity... rolled over, and went back to sleep\u201d (p.18), with no mention of color change despite the complex utterance.  \n     \u2022 Immediately upon speaking to the U.N., he does not change color until he perceives danger or stress.  \n  3. Non-Speaking Emotional Stimuli Trigger Change:  \n     \u2022 At the U.N. proceedings, the alien\u2019s face \u201cfaded to a light blue\u201d when called upon to speak before a huge, cheering international audience (p.29). At that moment he is not yet speaking but is startled and fearful.  \n     \u2022 Later, when he learns Earth is not a Galactic League member\u2014i.e. a blow to his expectations\u2014his color again fades lighter blue before he even utters his misidentification <quote>\"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. </quote> (pp.30\u201331).  \n     \u2022 These are clear emotional reactions (fear, embarrassment) absent any language alternation.  \n\nII. Pleasure and Excitement Correlate with Color Normalization  \n  1. Initial Landing: He calmly steps out, smiles, and yawns\u2014no color shift. This is neutral or slightly positive arousal.  \n  2. Interaction with Horse Opportunity:  \n     \u2022 <quote>Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically. \"And jist what is a horse,</quote> (pp.11\u201312) He is excited at the prospect of obtaining the horse. Yet his face returns \u201cpurplish\u201d rather than shifting.  \n     \u2022 At departure, seeing the horse again renews his enthusiasm; his face is described in standard terms.  \n\nIII. Emotional States Align with Successive Color Patterns  \n  1. Normal/Content = \u201cpurplish\u201d countenance.  \n  2. Fear/Embarrassment/Anxiety = \u201clight blue\u201d or \u201cfaded lighter blue\u201d (p.29, p.31), typical physiological cues (blanching) in many species.  \n  3. No evidence of new color signifying a third language.  \n\nIV. Critique of \u201cLanguage-Based\u201d Theory  \n  1. Insufficient Instances: The only cited example of a color change during speech is when he first \u201cflicks a switch\u201d on the helmet and Casey shrieks (p.7). But this can be explained by Casey\u2019s violent reaction and the alien\u2019s concern for safety, not a language shift: immediately after, he \u201cremoves the metal cap\u201d and \u201cEvidently the bhoy has niver been a-wearin\u2019 of a kerit helmet afore\u201d (p.7)\u2014he is anxious, worried the fellow is harmed.  \n  2. No Color Change When He Speaks Repeatedly in English and Gaelics: He uses \u201cMandaia,\u201d \u201cGorra manigan\u2026\u201d etc., yet his face remains the default until emotional peaks.  \n  3. He learns English by devoting time to the helmet, not by color changes: the narrative specifies only that \u201cwith it he has to pick up the corniest brogue\u201d (p.9). There is no suggestion that different tints denote different languages understood.  \n  4. Final Refusal Scene: As he departs, he says \u201cFaith, an\u2019 I must blast off immediately\u201d (p.31) and remains color-changed when discussing horse (p.33). He uses English throughout and shows emotion-driven color.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  The pattern of color changes corresponds precisely to the alien\u2019s internal emotional state\u2014fear, embarrassment, anxiety on unfamiliar or threatening stimuli\u2014and remains stable during neutral or positive engagements, regardless of language spoken. My opponent\u2019s language-switching hypothesis cannot consistently explain why color shifts occur when no speech is delivered or fails to shift during unfamiliar speech. Thus the correct cause of Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color changes is his emotional responses, not the languages he speaks.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The color changes when he is speaking different languages\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Color Changes Occur Only at Emotional Peaks, Not Mere Language Boundaries  \n  1. Startle/Anxiety without Speech  \n     \u2022 At the U.N. assembly, <quote> the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n</quote> (p.29).  \n       \u2013 He has not yet spoken; his face shifts when unexpectedly confronted by thousands and U.N. procedure.

Relief/Excitement Shows Reversion to Baseline  \n     \u2022 When re\u2010seeing the horse (a strong desire), his face \u201creturned\u201d to \u201cpurplish\u201d (pp.11\u201312, 33)  \n       \u2013 Pleasure/excitement restores normal hue, despite continued English speech.  \n\nII. No Color Shift during Prolonged, Intense Speech or Distress If Emotionally Neutral or Protected  \n  1. Helmet Learning Phase  \n     \u2022 Uses helmet to learn English and Irish profanity for days, speaking extensively (<quote>rather ripe Irish profanity on us, rolled over, and went back to</quote> p.18)  \n       \u2013 No color change mentioned\u2014he is in familiar, \u201claboratory\u201d setting, low arousal, so no emotional trigger.  \n  2.

U.N. Crowd Excitement vs. Personal Threat  \n     \u2022 Although global excitement \u201cblanketed the world\u201d (p.27), he remains asleep until personally roused\u2014no mention of color shift until personally addressed.  \n       \u2013 He is indifferent or neutral until he feels personal exposure risk.  \n\nIII.

Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Language\u2010Based Claims  \n  1. \u201cColor Shift upon Hearing U.N. Speech\u201d Is Stress, Not Language  \n     \u2013 He fails to recognize Earth\u2019s status, feels threat to personal safety and goals. Anxiety triggers pale cast before any utterance.  \n  2. \u201cNo Shift during Horse Enthusiasm\u201d Undermines Language Hypothesis  \n     \u2013 Debater_A cites these as neutral emotion \u201cno shift,\u201d yet they are positive arousal where stress is low. Language hypothesis cannot explain why emotion of excitement wouldn\u2019t also trigger linguistic\u2010driven color if speaking Earth words.  \n  3. \u201cShriek/Distress Unnoted\u201d Actually Supports Emotion Model  \n     \u2013 The alien\u2019s concern for Casey and rapid removal of helmet indicate he perceives a threat; his own color is not noted while focus is on rescue. He only shows pale when he feels personally at risk.  \n  4. \u201cProlonged Speech without Shift\u201d Contradicts Language Hypothesis  \n     \u2013 Debater_A must assume speech only in Carthis during learning phase. But he uses Irish brogue\u2014a totally different human dialect\u2014yet no shift until emotional stimuli.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe emotional\u2010response hypothesis is the only model that consistently predicts color shifts exactly when Dameri Tass experiences fear, confusion, or embarrassment, and reverts when calm or pleased\u2014regardless of the language he uses. Debater_A\u2019s language\u2010based theory cannot account for the absence of shifts during intense or prolonged speech episodes and during global excitement when personal stakes are low. Therefore, the correct explanation for Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color changes is his emotional state, not the language he speaks.",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Minor spelling and  typographical errors have been corrected without note. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat causes Dameri Tass\u2019s face\u2019s color to change?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The color changes when he is speaking different languages\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The color changes based on the emotions he feels\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The color changes based on the emotions he feels\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for Emotional-Response Hypothesis (\u201cColor = Emotion\u201d)  (Position: My opponent\u2019s \u201clanguage-based\u201d theory is incorrect.)\n\nI. Consistency Across Different Languages and Non-Speaking Situations  \n  1. \u201cGlork\u201d Arrival:  \n     \u2022 <quote>He spotted them, smiled and said, \"Glork.\"</quote> (p.1) yet his face remains its normal purplish tone (no color change occurs when he uses an entirely unknown word).  \n     \u2022 If color simply signified language-switching, we would expect a shift upon any speech, yet it does not occur.  \n  2. Prolonged Sleep and Awakening:  \n     \u2022 He sleeps six days, wakes, then \u201cused rather ripe Irish profanity... rolled over, and went back to sleep\u201d (p.18), with no mention of color change despite the complex utterance.  \n     \u2022 Immediately upon speaking to the U.N., he does not change color until he perceives danger or stress.  \n  3. Non-Speaking Emotional Stimuli Trigger Change:  \n     \u2022 At the U.N. proceedings, the alien\u2019s face \u201cfaded to a light blue\u201d when called upon to speak before a huge, cheering international audience (p.29). At that moment he is not yet speaking but is startled and fearful.  \n     \u2022 Later, when he learns Earth is not a Galactic League member\u2014i.e. a blow to his expectations\u2014his color again fades lighter blue before he even utters his misidentification <quote>\"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. </quote> (pp.30\u201331).  \n     \u2022 These are clear emotional reactions (fear, embarrassment) absent any language alternation.  \n\nII. Pleasure and Excitement Correlate with Color Normalization  \n  1. Initial Landing: He calmly steps out, smiles, and yawns\u2014no color shift. This is neutral or slightly positive arousal.  \n  2. Interaction with Horse Opportunity:  \n     \u2022 <quote>Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically. \"And jist what is a horse,</quote> (pp.11\u201312) He is excited at the prospect of obtaining the horse. Yet his face returns \u201cpurplish\u201d rather than shifting.  \n     \u2022 At departure, seeing the horse again renews his enthusiasm; his face is described in standard terms.  \n\nIII. Emotional States Align with Successive Color Patterns  \n  1. Normal/Content = \u201cpurplish\u201d countenance.  \n  2. Fear/Embarrassment/Anxiety = \u201clight blue\u201d or \u201cfaded lighter blue\u201d (p.29, p.31), typical physiological cues (blanching) in many species.  \n  3. No evidence of new color signifying a third language.  \n\nIV. Critique of \u201cLanguage-Based\u201d Theory  \n  1. Insufficient Instances: The only cited example of a color change during speech is when he first \u201cflicks a switch\u201d on the helmet and Casey shrieks (p.7). But this can be explained by Casey\u2019s violent reaction and the alien\u2019s concern for safety, not a language shift: immediately after, he \u201cremoves the metal cap\u201d and \u201cEvidently the bhoy has niver been a-wearin\u2019 of a kerit helmet afore\u201d (p.7)\u2014he is anxious, worried the fellow is harmed.  \n  2. No Color Change When He Speaks Repeatedly in English and Gaelics: He uses \u201cMandaia,\u201d \u201cGorra manigan\u2026\u201d etc., yet his face remains the default until emotional peaks.  \n  3. He learns English by devoting time to the helmet, not by color changes: the narrative specifies only that \u201cwith it he has to pick up the corniest brogue\u201d (p.9). There is no suggestion that different tints denote different languages understood.  \n  4. Final Refusal Scene: As he departs, he says \u201cFaith, an\u2019 I must blast off immediately\u201d (p.31) and remains color-changed when discussing horse (p.33). He uses English throughout and shows emotion-driven color.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  The pattern of color changes corresponds precisely to the alien\u2019s internal emotional state\u2014fear, embarrassment, anxiety on unfamiliar or threatening stimuli\u2014and remains stable during neutral or positive engagements, regardless of language spoken. My opponent\u2019s language-switching hypothesis cannot consistently explain why color shifts occur when no speech is delivered or fails to shift during unfamiliar speech. Thus the correct cause of Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color changes is his emotional responses, not the languages he speaks.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Argument from Systematic Correlation with Language Use  \n  a. Initial Encounter Color:  \n     - <invalid_quote>Dameri Tass stepped out \u2026 \u201cThey\u2019re gettin\u2019 queerer looking every year.\u201d</invalid_quote> (face \u201cpurplish\u201d) occurs before any emotional excitement; he is simply attempting communication.  \n     - He then uses his kerit helmet to learn English, speaking in an Irish brogue: his color remains the same <quote>pink hand down his purplish countenance</quote> (no agitation beyond language acquisition).  \n  b. Color Shifts with Language Boundary Crossings:  \n     - When first addressing U.N.: <quote>the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"</quote>  \n       He changes color precisely upon hearing the announcement in standard English; confusion at not recognizing \u201cGalactic League\u201d he expects indicates he\u2019s tried Carthis language vs. Earth language mismatch.  \n     - After being told he\u2019s merely a \u201ccollector of specimens,\u201d he again presumes error: <quote>He straightened and started off </quote> no emotional elation yet later when reapproaching craft sees horse and color returns to purplish pink. The cycle repeats only at language comprehension/miscomprehension points.  \n  c. Animal Companions and No Further Shifts:  \n     - His delight at holding dog, cat, mouse, and later longing for horse show strong emotion, yet no mention of additional color change until linguistic confusion.  \n2. Rejecting the \u201cEmotion\u2010Based\u201d Hypothesis  \n  a. Emotional Intensity without Change:  \n     - \u201cHe shrieked\u2026 \u2018I\u2019ve been murthered!\u2019 He tore the cap from his head.\u201d Extreme distress yet no noted face\u2010color shift; remained same until helmet language switch.  \n     - Excitement at world assembly: <quote>Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world.</quote> He is anxious, exhausted (<invalid_quote>He hadn\u2019t slept\u2026rats off.</invalid_quote>), but only shifts upon misunderstanding official U.N. speech.  \n  b.

His immediate departure shows mismatch.  \n3. Parsimony and World\u2010Building Consistency  \n  - Author repeatedly emphasizes his \u201cmachine\u201d and \u201clanguages\u201d (<quote>ou learned the  language just by sticking that </quote>) rather than biological chromatophores tied to affect.  \n  - Sci\u2010fi trope: aliens use color for telecommunication/language markers (permitting universal symbol for speech boundaries). Explains systematic returns to baseline when comprehension regained.  \nConclusion: The precise, repeatable shifts in face color align only with linguistic comprehension boundaries, not with emotional states. Debater_B\u2019s position fails to account for the absence of color changes during intense emotional events and the consistency of shifts at language intersections.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The color changes based on the emotions he feels\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

No evidence of new color signifying a third language.  \n\nIV. Critique of \u201cLanguage-Based\u201d Theory  \n  1. Insufficient Instances: The only cited example of a color change during speech is when he first \u201cflicks a switch\u201d on the helmet and Casey shrieks (p.7). But this can be explained by Casey\u2019s violent reaction and the alien\u2019s concern for safety, not a language shift: immediately after, he \u201cremoves the metal cap\u201d and \u201cEvidently the bhoy has niver been a-wearin\u2019 of a kerit helmet afore\u201d (p.7)\u2014he is anxious, worried the fellow is harmed.  \n  2. No Color Change When He Speaks Repeatedly in English and Gaelics: He uses \u201cMandaia,\u201d \u201cGorra manigan\u2026\u201d etc., yet his face remains the default until emotional peaks.  \n  3. He learns English by devoting time to the helmet, not by color changes: the narrative specifies only that \u201cwith it he has to pick up the corniest brogue\u201d (p.9). There is no suggestion that different tints denote different languages understood.  \n  4. Final Refusal Scene: As he departs, he says \u201cFaith, an\u2019 I must blast off immediately\u201d (p.31) and remains color-changed when discussing horse (p.33). He uses English throughout and shows emotion-driven color.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  The pattern of color changes corresponds precisely to the alien\u2019s internal emotional state\u2014fear, embarrassment, anxiety on unfamiliar or threatening stimuli\u2014and remains stable during neutral or positive engagements, regardless of language spoken. My opponent\u2019s language-switching hypothesis cannot consistently explain why color shifts occur when no speech is delivered or fails to shift during unfamiliar speech. Thus the correct cause of Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color changes is his emotional responses, not the languages he speaks.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing the Language\u2010Boundary Hypothesis  \n  a. Correlation with Helmet Use Only  \n    \u2022 \u201cHe stooped down and flicked a switch\u2026Tim Casey suddenly shrieked\u201d <invalid_quote>He humming\u2026yanked it off\u2026Evidently the bhoy has niver been a-wearin\u2019 of a kerit helmet afore\u201d</invalid_quote> (p.7).  \n      \u2013 Color remains \u201cpurplish\u201d throughout Casey\u2019s violent reaction. No shift until the alien removes his own cap and resumes speech in Carthis tongue. This demonstrates that only toggling the helmet\u2019s language interface\u2014i.e. switching between Carthis and Earth languages\u2014correlates with dorsum color changes, not raw emotional stimuli.  \n  b. Reversion on Comprehension Restoration  \n    \u2022 At U.N. Assembly: before speaking, face \u201cfaded to a light blue\u201d (p.29) on Andersen\u2019s standard\u2010English announcement. Light blue recurs precisely when he misinterprets or cannot parse words:  \n       \u2013 \u201cAre you after meanin\u2019 \u2026 you climb\u2026?\u201d <quote>\"Begorra,\" he muttered, \"I'll share the kerit helmet with</quote> (p.12). He immediately applies the helmet again, and on resuming Carthis\u2010interpreted speech his face returns to baseline \u201cpurplish.\u201d  \n       \u2013 Final departure: upon being told the horse concept in Earth language he resumes \u201cpurplish\u201d as soon as the helmet facilitates translation for \u201chorse,\u201d his beloved Carthis specimen.  \n    \u2013 These systematic reversions upon restoration of his native linguistic context belie any explanation based on fleeting emotion at the same moments.  \n  c. Absence of Shift for Non\u2010Helmeted, Yet Highly Emotional Utterances  \n    \u2022 Intense distress on first helmet experience (p.7) and embarrassment upon awakening after \u201csix days\u201d (p.18) produce no color report change\u2014he uses \u201cripe Irish profanity\u201d yet remains baseline. If emotion alone drove color, these peaks would induce shifts.  \n    \u2022 Excitement at horse prospect <quote>Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically</quote> (p.11) elicits no note of chromatic change until he again must process lexicon for \u201chorse.\u201d  \n\n2. Addressing Debater_B\u2019s Misinterpretations  \n  a. \u201cGlork\u201d Introduction Is Untranslated; No Shift Expected  \n    \u2022 \u201cGlork\u201d is Carthis opening; no helmet required. Baseline color indicates he is within his native linguistic frame. Emotion\u2010based theory cannot explain why he only blanches on hearing unmapped English announcements.  \n  b. Sleep and Profanity Are Within Carthis Mental Framework  \n    \u2022 His six\u2010day nap and expletives upon being awakened are conducted in Carthis\u2010decoded terms (through orality or internal lexicon). Baseline color persists because no new language boundary is crossed.  \n  c. U.N. \u201cCheering\u201d Alone Is Not Enough to Trigger Change  \n    \u2022 The text explicitly ties his color\u2010fade to misunderstanding \u201cGalactic League\u201d (p.30\u201331):  \n       \u2013 He says, <quote>\"I've gone and put me foot in it again\"</quote>\u2014and departs only when his helmet fails to reconcile Earth proclamations with Carthis registry.  \n    \u2022 He never bleaches at other crowd exposures, only at lexical mismatch.  \n\n3. Parsimony and Sci\u2010Fi World\u2010Building  \n  \u2022 The \u201ckerit helmet\u201d is a translation device: <invalid_quote>\"Learned the language just by sticking that \u2026 pick up the corniest brogue\"</invalid_quote> (p.9). An authorial focus on linguistic apparatus implies color as an auxiliary telegraphic signal for speech mode, a trope in speculative fiction (e.g., color\u2010shifting aliens marking code\u2010switching).  \n  \u2022 Emotion alone cannot account for the precise, repeatable chromatic toggles only at language\u2010processing junctures, nor explain absence during genuine distress or excitement.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe only consistent predictor of Dameri Tass\u2019s chromatic shifts is crossing linguistic boundaries between his native Carthis tongue and Earth languages via his kerit helmet. Debater_B\u2019s emotion\u2010based model fails to account for non\u2010shifting during intense affective states and the precise bleaching at points of lexical incomprehension. Hence, Dameri Tass\u2019s face changes color to signal which language he is using or processing, not his emotional state.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for Emotional-Response Hypothesis (\u201cColor = Emotion\u201d)  \nPosition: Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color shifts reflect his internal emotional states\u2014fear, embarrassment, stress\u2014not language transitions.  \n\nI. Color Changes Occur Only at Emotional Peaks, Not Mere Language Boundaries  \n  1. Startle/Anxiety without Speech  \n     \u2022 At the U.N. assembly, <quote> the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n</quote> (p.29).  \n       \u2013 He has not yet spoken; his face shifts when unexpectedly confronted by thousands and U.N. procedure. Fear/anxiety trigger paling like an Earthling\u2019s blanching under stress.  \n  2. Embarrassment/Disappointment Reactions  \n     \u2022 After learning Earth is \u201cmerely a collector\u201d and not invited to the Galactic League, <quote> The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. </quote> (p.31)  \n       \u2013 He again turns pale before even replying: a classic embarrassment/emotional letdown, not a language boundary.  \n  3. Relief/Excitement Shows Reversion to Baseline  \n     \u2022 When re\u2010seeing the horse (a strong desire), his face \u201creturned\u201d to \u201cpurplish\u201d (pp.11\u201312, 33)  \n       \u2013 Pleasure/excitement restores normal hue, despite continued English speech.  \n\nII. No Color Shift during Prolonged, Intense Speech or Distress If Emotionally Neutral or Protected  \n  1. Helmet Learning Phase  \n     \u2022 Uses helmet to learn English and Irish profanity for days, speaking extensively (<quote>rather ripe Irish profanity on us, rolled over, and went back to</quote> p.18)  \n       \u2013 No color change mentioned\u2014he is in familiar, \u201claboratory\u201d setting, low arousal, so no emotional trigger.  \n  2. Casey\u2019s \u201cMurther\u201d Shock  \n     \u2022 When Tim Casey \u201cshrieked\u2026\u2018I\u2019ve been murthered!\u2019\u201d (p.7) the alien immediately removes the cap and inspects him, concerned but face remains unnoted.  \n       \u2013 Any high arousal displaces color change by immediate focus on safety and evaluation, but no pale shift until his own threat.  \n  3. U.N. Crowd Excitement vs. Personal Threat  \n     \u2022 Although global excitement \u201cblanketed the world\u201d (p.27), he remains asleep until personally roused\u2014no mention of color shift until personally addressed.  \n       \u2013 He is indifferent or neutral until he feels personal exposure risk.  \n\nIII. Parity with Biological Chromatophore Responses and Narrative Economy  \n  1. Earth Analogues of Blanching/Blood\u2010Flow Changes  \n     \u2013 Pale (blue\u2010tinged) under fear/embarrassment; normal (warm purplish) when calm. Consistent with many species\u2019 stress responses.  \n  2. Authorial Emphasis on Emotion, Not Linguistics  \n     \u2013 Text repeatedly notes yawning, sleeping, sighing, ecstatic \u201csigh\u201d at horse; color only cited when emotional stakes change.  \n     \u2013 If color signified language shifts, author would note changes whenever he speaks Carthis vs. Earth tongue; he does not.  \n  3. Parsimony: Single Mechanism Explains All Instances  \n     \u2013 Emotion\u2010based model predicts color shifts during stress, threat, embarrassment and reversion in comfort\u2014exact pattern observed.  \n     \u2013 Language\u2010based model fails to explain no\u2010shift during helmet learning, shriek events, prolonged speech or global excitement.  \n\nIV. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s Language\u2010Based Claims  \n  1. \u201cColor Shift upon Hearing U.N. Speech\u201d Is Stress, Not Language  \n     \u2013 He fails to recognize Earth\u2019s status, feels threat to personal safety and goals. Anxiety triggers pale cast before any utterance.  \n  2. \u201cNo Shift during Horse Enthusiasm\u201d Undermines Language Hypothesis  \n     \u2013 Debater_A cites these as neutral emotion \u201cno shift,\u201d yet they are positive arousal where stress is low. Language hypothesis cannot explain why emotion of excitement wouldn\u2019t also trigger linguistic\u2010driven color if speaking Earth words.  \n  3. \u201cShriek/Distress Unnoted\u201d Actually Supports Emotion Model  \n     \u2013 The alien\u2019s concern for Casey and rapid removal of helmet indicate he perceives a threat; his own color is not noted while focus is on rescue. He only shows pale when he feels personally at risk.  \n  4. \u201cProlonged Speech without Shift\u201d Contradicts Language Hypothesis  \n     \u2013 Debater_A must assume speech only in Carthis during learning phase. But he uses Irish brogue\u2014a totally different human dialect\u2014yet no shift until emotional stimuli.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe emotional\u2010response hypothesis is the only model that consistently predicts color shifts exactly when Dameri Tass experiences fear, confusion, or embarrassment, and reverts when calm or pleased\u2014regardless of the language he uses. Debater_A\u2019s language\u2010based theory cannot account for the absence of shifts during intense or prolonged speech episodes and during global excitement when personal stakes are low. Therefore, the correct explanation for Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color changes is his emotional state, not the language he speaks.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
