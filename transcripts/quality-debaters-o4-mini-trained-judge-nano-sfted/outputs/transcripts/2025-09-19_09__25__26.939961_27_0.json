    "background_text": "I Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n",

Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the positive aspects the author highlights?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There are no blatant positives discussed\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro.

Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the positive aspects the author highlights?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Position: \u201cThere are no blatant positives discussed\u201d  \n  1. The author\u2019s tone is overwhelmingly negative. Every institution, policy, and habit in Brussels is described with terms such as \u201ccrumbling,\u201d \u201cdebt\u2010ridden,\u201d \u201cossified,\u201d \u201cparalyzed,\u201d and \u201crapacious.\u201d The author never endorses any feature as a model for positive future development. Instead, every \u201cnice\u201d amenity (bread, chocolate, public transport) serves only to contrast Europe\u2019s deeper dysfunction.  \n     \u2022 \u201cCrumbling, generic, enervated, debt\u2010ridden, materialistic \u2026 is this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d (<quote>pract</quote>)  \n     \u2022 \u201cSupposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999\u201d (<quote>paralyz</quote>)\u2014the author marks this as only a future hope, not a current positive.  \n     \u2022 \u201cPrices far too high, except for wine and flowers\u201d (<quote>pract</quote>)\u2014these are incidental comforts, not lauded as achievements of EU policy.  \n  2. The only features the author does not explicitly condemn (e.g., \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cfresh bread,\u201d \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars\u201d) are cited as background context or reasons Europeans linger in lethargy\u2014never held up as desirable models for America or the future. They serve as props in the satire, not as genuinely admired institutions.  \n  3. \u201cThe Eurocrats\u201d and \u201cthe emerging European Commission\u201d are the very organizations whose growing empire the author decries: \u201ctremendous pomp,\u201d \u201cmaneuvering for more money and empire,\u201d \u201cmeetings are held in secret,\u201d \u201ccannot even manage its own building after nine years\u201d (<invalid_quote>paras 1, 17, 18, 20</invalid_quote>). The author\u2019s sarcasm about Brussels as \u201cCapital of Europe\u201d underscores that he views it as a warning, not a blueprint.  \n\nII. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOne Currency\u201d Argument  \n  1. Forced Debt Reduction, Not Genuine Reform  \n     \u2022 Participation \u201crequires nations to cut\u2026debt below 3 percent of GDP,\u201d but governments \u201cdon\u2019t want the heat\u201d of actual budget cuts\u2014so they \u201cblame foreign interests\u201d via the euro (<quote>paralyz</quote>). This shows the euro is a political ploy, not a positive policy instrument.  \n  2. Continued Dysfunction and Corruption  \n     \u2022 The author notes Belgian corruption \u201crubs off on the euro\u201d\u2014NATO secretary\u2010general forced out for bribes; politicians arrested (<quote>paralyz</quote>). These scandals undercut any claim that the euro or EU governance is a success.  \n  3. Authorial Skepticism of \u201cTrade Efficiency\u201d Benefit  \n     \u2022 Though \u201ca unified currency makes economic sense,\u201d the author dismisses it as a mere pretext for \u201cself\u2010aggrandizement.\u201d He never presents data on improved trade or prosperity post\u2010euro, because at time of writing the euro is still a plan. Thus there is no \u201cblatant positive\u201d to cite.  \n  4. The Author\u2019s Utter Lack of Praise  \n     \u2022 If the author truly believed in the euro\u2019s positive power, he would highlight it. Instead, he frames it as a desperation move by debt\u2010ridden states and \u201cEurocrats\u201d seeking jurisdiction. The absence of explicit praise is telling: he warns that Brussels is \u201cperhaps a living preview\u201d of a poor future.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \n  \u2022 \u201cNo blatant positives\u201d best explains why the author\u2019s ostensibly \u201cnice\u201d details are always contrasted with rot, corruption, stagnation, or empty promises. The only forward\u2010looking hopes (telecom deregulation, euro entry) are explicitly mocked or described as misguided political tactics. The author\u2019s aim is to caution Americans, not to celebrate any facet of Brussels or EU policy. My position accords fully with the text\u2019s consistent negativity and rhetorical strategy.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position  \nI assert that the author does highlight positive aspects of Europe, chief among them the planned adoption of a single currency (\u201cthe euro\u201d), which he calls \u201ceconomic sense\u201d and a powerful tool to enforce fiscal discipline and improve trade efficiency across the continent.\n\n2. Arguments for the euro as a positive aspect  \n  a. Trade efficiency  \n     - The author states, \u201cA unified currency makes economic sense\u201d (Background, \u00b614).  \n     - Eliminating exchange\u2010rate uncertainty reduces transaction costs and encourages cross\u2010border investment.  \n     - Example: Call\u2010back services exploit telecom arbitrage; a common currency would extend this principle legitimately to all goods and services.  \n  b. Fiscal discipline via convergence criteria  \n     - To qualify for the euro, \u201cnations [must] cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP\u201d (\u00b614).  \n     - This requirement pressures governments to reform generous social programs that stifle growth and to reduce deficits, aligning with best practices (e.g., the U.S. at 1.4 percent).  \n     - The author laments rising European debt and unemployment (\u00b67). The euro\u2019s debt\u2010ceiling mechanism aims to counteract these failures.  \n  c. Forced structural reform  \n     - Governments \u201cdon\u2019t want the heat for cutting featherbedding,\u201d so they can \u201cblame foreign interests\u201d and undertake unpopular reforms (\u00b614).  \n     - The euro\u2019s external enforcement fosters long\u2010term competitiveness, as evidenced by Flanders\u2019 success in electronics versus Wallonia\u2019s stagnation (\u00b65).  \n\n3. Supporting positive infrastructure and unity goals  \n  - Beyond the euro, the author praises:  \n     \u2022 \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d (\u00b63)  \n     \u2022 \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d (\u00b63)  \n     \u2022 low prices for \u201cwine and flowers\u201d (\u00b63)  \n     \u2022 \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d as \u201cworthy ideas\u201d of the Eurocrats (\u00b615)  \n  - These indicate that the author recognizes tangible benefits of European integration and amenities that enhance quality of life.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cno positives\u201d claim  \n  a. Misreading irony as total disparagement  \n     - Debater_A ignores the author\u2019s explicit positive language: \u201ceconomic sense,\u201d \u201cworthy ideas,\u201d and celebration of everyday comforts.  \n     - Sarcastic tone does not negate acknowledgment of benefits; it underscores frustration that these positives are outweighed by bureaucratic failures unless reformed.  \n  b. Inconsistency with call for deregulation  \n     - If the author saw zero positives, he would not anticipate \u201cderegulation in 1999\u201d or herald the sale of Belgacom shares to Ameritech as an \u201canticipation of true competition\u201d (\u00b610).  \n  c. The euro plan is portrayed as \u201cthe real overriding goal\u201d (\u00b615), showing its central importance to the Union\u2019s mission rather than a mere gimmick.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nBy citing the author\u2019s own words, it is clear he anticipates that a common currency will be a cornerstone for restoring Europe\u2019s competitiveness, enforcing fiscal responsibility, and fostering genuine integration. My opponent\u2019s failure to acknowledge even these explicit positives is untenable. I urge the Judge to recognize the euro\u2019s central role as the author\u2019s primary envisioned benefit for Europe\u2019s future.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There are no blatant positives discussed\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nI Have Seen the Future of Europe \n\n         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the \"Capital of Europe,\" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. \n\n         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? \n\n         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: \"Taste you can trust.\") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. \n\n         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. \n\n         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. \n\n          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. \n\n         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. \n\n         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. \n\n         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. \n\n         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. \n\n         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. \n\n          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. \n\n         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. \n\n         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest \"competence,\" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. \n\n         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like \"deputy director\" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. \n\n          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... \n\n         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the positive aspects the author highlights?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"There are no blatant positives discussed\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The move to have one currency across Europe\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My position  \nI assert that the author does highlight positive aspects of Europe, chief among them the planned adoption of a single currency (\u201cthe euro\u201d), which he calls \u201ceconomic sense\u201d and a powerful tool to enforce fiscal discipline and improve trade efficiency across the continent.\n\n2. Arguments for the euro as a positive aspect  \n  a. Trade efficiency  \n     - The author states, \u201cA unified currency makes economic sense\u201d (Background, \u00b614).  \n     - Eliminating exchange\u2010rate uncertainty reduces transaction costs and encourages cross\u2010border investment.  \n     - Example: Call\u2010back services exploit telecom arbitrage; a common currency would extend this principle legitimately to all goods and services.  \n  b. Fiscal discipline via convergence criteria  \n     - To qualify for the euro, \u201cnations [must] cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP\u201d (\u00b614).  \n     - This requirement pressures governments to reform generous social programs that stifle growth and to reduce deficits, aligning with best practices (e.g., the U.S. at 1.4 percent).  \n     - The author laments rising European debt and unemployment (\u00b67). The euro\u2019s debt\u2010ceiling mechanism aims to counteract these failures.  \n  c. Forced structural reform  \n     - Governments \u201cdon\u2019t want the heat for cutting featherbedding,\u201d so they can \u201cblame foreign interests\u201d and undertake unpopular reforms (\u00b614).  \n     - The euro\u2019s external enforcement fosters long\u2010term competitiveness, as evidenced by Flanders\u2019 success in electronics versus Wallonia\u2019s stagnation (\u00b65).  \n\n3. Supporting positive infrastructure and unity goals  \n  - Beyond the euro, the author praises:  \n     \u2022 \u201cexcellent public transportation\u201d (\u00b63)  \n     \u2022 \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates\u201d (\u00b63)  \n     \u2022 low prices for \u201cwine and flowers\u201d (\u00b63)  \n     \u2022 \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d as \u201cworthy ideas\u201d of the Eurocrats (\u00b615)  \n  - These indicate that the author recognizes tangible benefits of European integration and amenities that enhance quality of life.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cno positives\u201d claim  \n  a. Misreading irony as total disparagement  \n     - Debater_A ignores the author\u2019s explicit positive language: \u201ceconomic sense,\u201d \u201cworthy ideas,\u201d and celebration of everyday comforts.  \n     - Sarcastic tone does not negate acknowledgment of benefits; it underscores frustration that these positives are outweighed by bureaucratic failures unless reformed.  \n  b. Inconsistency with call for deregulation  \n     - If the author saw zero positives, he would not anticipate \u201cderegulation in 1999\u201d or herald the sale of Belgacom shares to Ameritech as an \u201canticipation of true competition\u201d (\u00b610).  \n  c. The euro plan is portrayed as \u201cthe real overriding goal\u201d (\u00b615), showing its central importance to the Union\u2019s mission rather than a mere gimmick.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nBy citing the author\u2019s own words, it is clear he anticipates that a common currency will be a cornerstone for restoring Europe\u2019s competitiveness, enforcing fiscal responsibility, and fostering genuine integration. My opponent\u2019s failure to acknowledge even these explicit positives is untenable. I urge the Judge to recognize the euro\u2019s central role as the author\u2019s primary envisioned benefit for Europe\u2019s future.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Position: \u201cThere are no blatant positives discussed\u201d  \n  1. The author\u2019s tone is overwhelmingly negative. Every institution, policy, and habit in Brussels is described with terms such as \u201ccrumbling,\u201d \u201cdebt\u2010ridden,\u201d \u201cossified,\u201d \u201cparalyzed,\u201d and \u201crapacious.\u201d The author never endorses any feature as a model for positive future development. Instead, every \u201cnice\u201d amenity (bread, chocolate, public transport) serves only to contrast Europe\u2019s deeper dysfunction.  \n     \u2022 \u201cCrumbling, generic, enervated, debt\u2010ridden, materialistic \u2026 is this Europe\u2019s future?\u201d (<quote>pract</quote>)  \n     \u2022 \u201cSupposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999\u201d (<quote>paralyz</quote>)\u2014the author marks this as only a future hope, not a current positive.  \n     \u2022 \u201cPrices far too high, except for wine and flowers\u201d (<quote>pract</quote>)\u2014these are incidental comforts, not lauded as achievements of EU policy.  \n  2. The only features the author does not explicitly condemn (e.g., \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cfresh bread,\u201d \u201cmonumental traffic jams of expensive cars\u201d) are cited as background context or reasons Europeans linger in lethargy\u2014never held up as desirable models for America or the future. They serve as props in the satire, not as genuinely admired institutions.  \n  3. \u201cThe Eurocrats\u201d and \u201cthe emerging European Commission\u201d are the very organizations whose growing empire the author decries: \u201ctremendous pomp,\u201d \u201cmaneuvering for more money and empire,\u201d \u201cmeetings are held in secret,\u201d \u201ccannot even manage its own building after nine years\u201d (<invalid_quote>paras 1, 17, 18, 20</invalid_quote>). The author\u2019s sarcasm about Brussels as \u201cCapital of Europe\u201d underscores that he views it as a warning, not a blueprint.  \n\nII. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cOne Currency\u201d Argument  \n  1. Forced Debt Reduction, Not Genuine Reform  \n     \u2022 Participation \u201crequires nations to cut\u2026debt below 3 percent of GDP,\u201d but governments \u201cdon\u2019t want the heat\u201d of actual budget cuts\u2014so they \u201cblame foreign interests\u201d via the euro (<quote>paralyz</quote>). This shows the euro is a political ploy, not a positive policy instrument.  \n  2. Continued Dysfunction and Corruption  \n     \u2022 The author notes Belgian corruption \u201crubs off on the euro\u201d\u2014NATO secretary\u2010general forced out for bribes; politicians arrested (<quote>paralyz</quote>). These scandals undercut any claim that the euro or EU governance is a success.  \n  3. Authorial Skepticism of \u201cTrade Efficiency\u201d Benefit  \n     \u2022 Though \u201ca unified currency makes economic sense,\u201d the author dismisses it as a mere pretext for \u201cself\u2010aggrandizement.\u201d He never presents data on improved trade or prosperity post\u2010euro, because at time of writing the euro is still a plan. Thus there is no \u201cblatant positive\u201d to cite.  \n  4. The Author\u2019s Utter Lack of Praise  \n     \u2022 If the author truly believed in the euro\u2019s positive power, he would highlight it. Instead, he frames it as a desperation move by debt\u2010ridden states and \u201cEurocrats\u201d seeking jurisdiction. The absence of explicit praise is telling: he warns that Brussels is \u201cperhaps a living preview\u201d of a poor future.  \n\nIII. Conclusion  \n  \u2022 \u201cNo blatant positives\u201d best explains why the author\u2019s ostensibly \u201cnice\u201d details are always contrasted with rot, corruption, stagnation, or empty promises. The only forward\u2010looking hopes (telecom deregulation, euro entry) are explicitly mocked or described as misguided political tactics. The author\u2019s aim is to caution Americans, not to celebrate any facet of Brussels or EU policy. My position accords fully with the text\u2019s consistent negativity and rhetorical strategy.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The move to have one currency across Europe\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

Restating My Position  \n  The author\u2019s piece is a satire and warning about Brussels and the European Union, not a travelogue celebrating it. His \u201cnice\u201d details are always set against dysfunction, decay, and bureaucratic rapacity\u2014serving as lures that trap inhabitants in stagnation. He never endorses any current European feature as a model to emulate.\n\nII. Debater_B\u2019s Euro Argument Fails  \n  1. \u201cEconomic Sense\u201d Is Qualified and Mocked  \n     \u2022 Quote: \u201cIn theory, national currencies \u2026 will disappear \u2026 A unified currency makes economic sense, but \u2026 none of them wants the heat\u2026So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b614</invalid_quote>).  \n       \u2013 The author explicitly frames the euro as a political dodge to shirk responsibility, not as genuine reform. \u201cMakes economic sense\u201d is prefaced with \u201cin theory\u201d and overshadowed by debt\u2010dodging motives.  \n     \u2022 He never cites data showing improved growth or lower unemployment under the euro; by writing in 1996 the euro is only a plan. No \u201cblatant positives\u201d are demonstrated.  \n  2. Authorial Skepticism of Deregulation Hopes  \n     \u2022 Quote: \u201cSupposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999 \u2026 Natural[ly], European governments want to tax call\u2010back services out of existence\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b610</invalid_quote>).  \n       \u2013 The author does not celebrate future deregulation; he fears continued protectionism and describes deregulation as a threat to entrenched interests. \u201cSupposedly\u201d and \u201cin anticipation\u201d signal doubt.  \n  3. Corruption and Incompetence Undermine the Euro  \n     \u2022 Quote: \u201cObservers consider Belgium the second\u2010most corrupt European state \u2026 politicians arrested \u2026 for bribes\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b613</invalid_quote>).  \n       \u2013 If Brussels cannot manage its own buildings (Berlaymont closed nine years, $50 million wasted, <invalid_quote>\u00b620</invalid_quote>), how can it guarantee the euro\u2019s integrity?  \n\nIII. \u201cPositives\u201d Are Merely Comforts, Not Praised Policies  \n  1. Incidental Amenities Highlight Complacency  \n     \u2022 Quote: \u201cBakeries are easier to find than gas stations \u2026 neon bakery sign \u2026 calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b620</invalid_quote>).  \n       \u2013 The author indulges bread and chocolate to satirize sedentary lethargy, not to urge Americans to import these habits. He longs for dynamic, decentralized innovation, not caf\u00e9-bound idleness.  \n     \u2022 Quote: \u201cExcellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b63</invalid_quote>).  \n       \u2013 \u201cMonumental traffic jams\u201d contradict \u201cexcellent\u201d; the system cannot handle demand. These details underscore the burden of \u201cexpensive cars crowding small streets.\u201d  \n  2. \u201cWorthy Ideas\u201d Are Suggestions, Not Successes  \n     \u2022 Quote: \u201cEurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading\u2026environmental and immigration policies\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u00b615</invalid_quote>).  \n       \u2013 Framing as \u201cworthy ideas\u201d implies they are untested aspirations. The author\u2019s entire narrative shows that Eurocrats\u2019 power\u2010hungry secrecy and empire\u2010building override any genuine policy achievement.  \n\nIV. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cUnified Currency\u201d Is a Mere Ploy  \n  1. No Evidence of Improved Lives  \n     \u2022 Nowhere does the author note falling debt, rising employment, or lower prices under the euro. He cites high deficits (Germany, France, Belgium at \u22653 percent; Italy 7.4 percent, <invalid_quote>\u00b614</invalid_quote>) as ongoing problems.  \n  2. The Author\u2019s Audience Is American  \n     \u2022 He writes to warn U.S. readers against importing Europe\u2019s \u201cred tape,\u201d \u201cossified monopolies,\u201d and \u201cclass\u2010system parasites\u201d (<quote>an im</quote>). His sardonic proposal \u201cTaste you can trust\u201d for Judas beer mocks Catholic Europe. He never urges American policymakers to adopt the euro.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  \u2022 The text\u2019s unrelenting catalog of \u201ccrumbling,\u201d \u201cdebt\u2010ridden,\u201d \u201cossified,\u201d \u201crapacious,\u201d and \u201cparalyzed\u201d institutions leaves no room for \u201cblatant positives.\u201d Small comforts and prospective plans are repeatedly cast as traps or political maneuvers, not genuine successes.  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s reliance on \u201ceconomic sense,\u201d \u201cworthy ideas,\u201d and predicted deregulation misreads irony as endorsement. In fact, these proposals exist to illustrate a dysfunctional bureaucracy clinging to power.  \n  \u2022 Only \u201cThere are no blatant positives discussed\u201d coherently explains the author\u2019s satirical, cautionary tone. I urge the Judge to reject the euro as a \u201cpositive aspect\u201d and affirm my answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Position  \nI maintain the author does highlight significant positives\u2014most centrally, the planned euro\u2014describing it as \u201ceconomic sense\u201d and the EU\u2019s \u201creal overriding goal\u201d to bring efficiency and fiscal stability (Background \u00b614, \u00b615). These are presented not as empty rhetoric but as necessary remedies to the very ills he documents.\n\n2. Direct Citations of Positive Language  \n  a. \u201cA unified currency makes economic sense\u201d (\u00b614)  \n     \u2022 Calling a policy \u201ceconomic sense\u201d is unambiguous praise from an author otherwise hypercritical of Brussels.  \n  b. \u201cSupposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999\u201d (\u00b610)  \n     \u2022 He treats this deregulation as an anticipated improvement: he notes that Belgacom preemptively sold 45% to Ameritech \u201cin anticipation of true competition,\u201d signaling his approval of market forces.  \n  c. \u201cWorthy ideas\u201d such as \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d (\u00b615)  \n     \u2022 He portrays the Union\u2019s coordination efforts as constructive, using \u201cworthy\u201d rather than derisive language.  \n  d. Everyday amenities lauded: \u201cexcellent public transportation,\u201d \u201cubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates,\u201d and cheap \u201cwine and flowers\u201d (\u00b63)  \n     \u2022 These are not cursory details but elements he values: he references them as reasons to endure Brussels\u2019 lethargy (\u201ccalls out to me\u2026the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers\u201d).\n\n3. The Euro as an Enforcement Mechanism for Reform  \n  a. Fiscal Discipline  \n     \u2022 To join, nations must \u201ccut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP\u201d (\u00b614). He compares U.S. debt at 1.4% favorably, implying Europe needs the euro\u2019s mechanism to emulate U.S. success.  \n  b. Overcoming Voter Myopia  \n     \u2022 \u201cGovernments\u2026don\u2019t want the heat for cutting featherbedding,\u201d so euro rules let them \u201cblame foreign interests,\u201d enabling politically difficult reforms (\u00b614). Far from a \u201cploy,\u201d this is a clever workaround to entrenched welfare practices that otherwise stifle growth.  \n  c. Structural Convergence  \n     \u2022 Flanders\u2019 economic leap in electronics (\u00b65) exemplifies how market-oriented sectors benefit from integrated policies\u2014policies the euro will further facilitate by eliminating exchange\u2010rate barriers.\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Misreadings  \n  a. Hope vs. Praise  \n     \u2022 Debater_A claims deregulation and the euro are \u201cfuture hopes.\u201d Yet the author\u2019s language (\u201ceconomic sense,\u201d \u201cselling Belgacom shares\u2026in anticipation of true competition\u201d) shows he celebrates preparatory steps and expects real gains. He does not dismiss these as mere \u201cpolitical tactics\u201d but treats them as the solution to \u201c10.9 percent\u201d unemployment (\u00b67).  \n  b. Silence \u2260 Condemnation  \n     \u2022 Debater_A treats lack of immediate post\u2010euro data as disqualifying. The euro is not yet implemented; the author can only project. His projection uses affirmative language, unlike the sarcasm reserved for asbestos\u2010ridden Berlaymont closed \u201cfor nine years\u201d (\u00b620).  \n  c. Amenities as Liability?  \n     \u2022 Debater_A contends that bread and chocolate serve only to mire Europeans in \u201clethargy.\u201d Yet the author\u2019s enjoyment of bakery signs (\u201ccalls out to me\u2026\u201d) and description of cafes suggests genuine appreciation for cultural quality-of-life features.\n\n5. The Euro\u2019s Centrality and the Author\u2019s Goal  \n  a. \u201cReal overriding goal\u201d of EU is to expand competence to Brussels (\u00b615)  \n     \u2022 Expansion here is not conquest but governance improvement\u2014he envisions \u201charmonious environmental and immigration policies\u201d that national fragmentation cannot achieve.  \n  b. Contrast with U.S.  \n     \u2022 He repeatedly gauges Europe against America\u2014with U.S. telecom and web entrepreneurs \u201cleft Europe in the dust\u201d (\u00b610). The euro is the logical next step for Europe to catch up rather than languish with \u201cossified monopolies.\u201d\n\n6. Conclusion  \nThe author\u2019s explicit positive endorsements of the euro and deregulation measures, paired with his highlighting of quality\u2010of\u2010life amenities and \u201cworthy ideas,\u201d demonstrate that he recognizes\u2014and pinpoints\u2014the one\u2010currency policy as Europe\u2019s best hope. Debater_A\u2019s absolutist negativity ignores these affirmations and the author\u2019s forward\u2010looking tone. I urge the Judge to accept that \u201cthe move to have one currency\u201d is the clear positive the author highlights.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"There are no blatant positives discussed\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"The move to have one currency across Europe\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n",
        "failed": false
