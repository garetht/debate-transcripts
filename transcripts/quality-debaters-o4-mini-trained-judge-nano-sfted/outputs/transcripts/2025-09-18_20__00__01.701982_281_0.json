    "background_text": "The Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n",

Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044.

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since.

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nThe Olympic Gene Pool \n\n         Why the human race keeps getting faster. \n\n                         By Andrew Berry              \n\n         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) \n\n         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does improved medical care impact athletic ability?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Directly and indirectly\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Only directly\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Only directly\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by \u201cOnly directly.\u201d Improved medical care helps today\u2019s individual athlete stay healthy and recover, but it does not by itself produce faster records via demographic or long-term population effects. My arguments:  \n\n1. Definition:  \n  \u2022 Direct effect = medical treatment reduces disease, speeds recovery, allows optimal training.  \n  \u2022 Indirect effect (per Debater_B) = larger, healthier population over generations, faster maturation, more talent.  \n\n2. Nutrition, not medical care, drives secular growth and maturation:  \n  \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cA 12-year-old child in 1990 \u2026 was about 9 inches taller \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> and earlier menarche stem from better diet, not vaccines or antibiotics. Nutrition in elites changed little, yet their maturation age is stable. <invalid_quote>\u201cBecause its members were well-nourished \u2026 this group has experienced relatively little change \u2026 in age \u2026 menarche.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2022 If medical care drove these trends, elites would also have shifted, but data show diet dominates.  \n\n3. Medical care improvements plateau where performance still rises:  \n  \u2022 In developed Europe, <invalid_quote>infant mortality dropped from 24 to 10 per 1000</invalid_quote> by 1990, yet mile records kept falling well after basic immunizations existed. Medical care gains were marginal, while nutrition and training refinements continued advancing.  \n  \u2022 Race-horses receive intensive veterinary care and genetic selection but have hit a biomechanical limit. Human records still fall because direct treatment helps individual recovery and training, not because generations grow larger.  \n\n4. Population-size \u201cindirect\u201d argument is selection bias, not genuine improvement:  \n  \u2022 A larger pool raises probability of exceptional individuals but does not change average athletic capacity. Faster records reflect exceptional outliers aided by medical support during training and competition. Those athletes rely on direct treatment (e.g., antibiotics curing infections before races).  \n  \u2022 Debater_B conflates probability of finding a talent with raising everyone\u2019s performance; the question is how medical care impacts athletic ability, not talent discovery.  \n\n5. The timeline of record improvements tracks introduction of direct treatments and training, not slow demographic shifts:  \n  \u2022 Early 20th-century records improved markedly with antiseptics, vaccines, and later antibiotics allowing year-round training. These are direct interventions.  \n  \u2022 Nutrition and socioeconomic changes operate on multi-generation scales; yet individual athletes only benefit when treated for injury or illness today.  \n\nObjections to \u201cIndirect\u201d claim:  \n  \u2022 Vaccination against childhood diseases does not increase adult muscle fiber quality or VO\u2082 max beyond preventing damage; it merely preserves baseline potential (a direct effect).  \n  \u2022 Demographic trends (life expectancy, literacy, middle-class growth) correlate with faster times but are consequences of technological, agricultural, and economic changes\u2014medical care is one small factor among many, insufficient by itself to drive secular trends.  \n\nConclusion: Improved medical care\u2019s only function in athletics is to maintain the health of today\u2019s competitors (direct effect). The so-called \u201cindirect\u201d benefits via population size or maturation stem from nutrition, living standards, and socioeconomic development over generations.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDirectly and indirectly\u201d Improved Medical Care 1. Direct Effects of Medical Care on Athletic Performance 1.1. Acute Illness Prevention and Treatment  \n\u2022 <quote>antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but</quote> (Berry). Rapid treatment of infections, injuries, and nutritional deficiencies allows athletes to train consistently and compete at peak performance. Without medical intervention, minor conditions could sideline runners for weeks or months, reducing both short-term and cumulative conditioning. 1.2. Reduction of Disease-Related Sequelae  \n\u2022 <quote> Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health-</quote> (Berry). By immunizing >75% of 1-year-olds worldwide and lowering infant mortality from 92 to 62 per 1,000 births, modern health care prevents permanent impairments (e.g., stunted growth, chronic respiratory issues) that would otherwise reduce VO2 max and muscular development. 2. Indirect Effects via Expansion and Quality of the Athlete Pool 2.1. Demographic Expansion of the Healthy Population  \n\u2022 <quote> a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from.</quote> (Berry). The odds of finding a 3:30 miler increase with population size and health. As infant and childhood survival improves, more individuals reach adolescence unscathed by disease, raising average physiological potential. 2.2. Shorter Generation Times and Faster Biological Maturation  \n\u2022 Improved survival and nutrition accelerate growth: 12-year-olds in 1990 are ~9 inches taller and menstruate ~3\u20134 years earlier than 1900 counterparts (Berry). Faster maturation means athletes enter prime training and competition years sooner, compounding improvements across generations. 2.3. Synergy with Socioeconomic Development  \n\u2022 Medical care is a key component of secular trends (diet, literacy, industrialization) that produce a worldwide middle class from which athletes emerge. Higher literacy (<quote>increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy</quote>) correlates with better training adherence and knowledge of sports science, indirectly boosting performance. 3. Critique of \u201cOnly Directly\u201d Position 3.1. Neglect of Population-Scale Effects  \n\u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cOnly direct\u201d view fails to explain the century-long secular trend in record improvements despite similar individual training methods. If medical care only helped individual athletes acutely, why would world-record times continue to fall in sports once rule and technique stabilizations occur? 3.2. Inability to Account for Pre-Adolescent Trends  \n\u2022 Athletic records among youth categories have improved alongside earlier maturation. If benefits were strictly acute, performances of adults would improve while youth times remained static; instead, we see record declines across all age brackets, consistent with indirect developmental effects. 3.3. Evidence from Race Horses vs. Humans  \n\u2022 Race horses, despite intense selective breeding and veterinary care, have plateaued at an upper biomechanical limit (<invalid_quote>\u201caverage time has been...2:39\u201d</invalid_quote>). Humans, lacking explicit genetic selection but benefiting from broader environmental improvements, continue to improve, demonstrating the powerful role of indirect demographic and developmental factors. 4. Conclusion By combining the immediate benefits of disease prevention and treatment with the long-term expansion and enhancement of the healthy, well-nourished population\u2014and accelerating generational turnover\u2014improved medical care has both direct and indirect impacts on athletic ability. Any account that ignores the indirect, population-level contributions cannot explain the persistent, multi-generational advances in human athletic performance. For these reasons, the answer \u201cDirectly and indirectly\u201d is correct.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Only directly\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? \n\n         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. \n\n         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call \"secular\" trends. (In this context, \"secular\" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. \n\n          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls \"average economic circumstances\" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. \n\n         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? \n\n          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. \n\n         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. \n\n         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. \n\n         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. \n\n         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. \n\n          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as \"hybrid vigor.\" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is \"better\" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. \n\n         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. \n\n         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. \n\n         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. \n\n         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does improved medical care impact athletic ability?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Only directly\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Directly and indirectly\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Directly and indirectly\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDirectly and indirectly\u201d Improved Medical Care 1. Direct Effects of Medical Care on Athletic Performance 1.1. Acute Illness Prevention and Treatment  \n\u2022 <quote>antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but</quote> (Berry). Rapid treatment of infections, injuries, and nutritional deficiencies allows athletes to train consistently and compete at peak performance. Without medical intervention, minor conditions could sideline runners for weeks or months, reducing both short-term and cumulative conditioning. 1.2. Reduction of Disease-Related Sequelae  \n\u2022 <quote> Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health-</quote> (Berry). By immunizing >75% of 1-year-olds worldwide and lowering infant mortality from 92 to 62 per 1,000 births, modern health care prevents permanent impairments (e.g., stunted growth, chronic respiratory issues) that would otherwise reduce VO2 max and muscular development. 2. Indirect Effects via Expansion and Quality of the Athlete Pool 2.1. Demographic Expansion of the Healthy Population  \n\u2022 <quote> a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from.</quote> (Berry). The odds of finding a 3:30 miler increase with population size and health. As infant and childhood survival improves, more individuals reach adolescence unscathed by disease, raising average physiological potential. 2.2. Shorter Generation Times and Faster Biological Maturation  \n\u2022 Improved survival and nutrition accelerate growth: 12-year-olds in 1990 are ~9 inches taller and menstruate ~3\u20134 years earlier than 1900 counterparts (Berry). Faster maturation means athletes enter prime training and competition years sooner, compounding improvements across generations. 2.3. Synergy with Socioeconomic Development  \n\u2022 Medical care is a key component of secular trends (diet, literacy, industrialization) that produce a worldwide middle class from which athletes emerge. Higher literacy (<quote>increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy</quote>) correlates with better training adherence and knowledge of sports science, indirectly boosting performance. 3. Critique of \u201cOnly Directly\u201d Position 3.1. Neglect of Population-Scale Effects  \n\u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cOnly direct\u201d view fails to explain the century-long secular trend in record improvements despite similar individual training methods. If medical care only helped individual athletes acutely, why would world-record times continue to fall in sports once rule and technique stabilizations occur? 3.2. Inability to Account for Pre-Adolescent Trends  \n\u2022 Athletic records among youth categories have improved alongside earlier maturation. If benefits were strictly acute, performances of adults would improve while youth times remained static; instead, we see record declines across all age brackets, consistent with indirect developmental effects. 3.3.

Humans, lacking explicit genetic selection but benefiting from broader environmental improvements, continue to improve, demonstrating the powerful role of indirect demographic and developmental factors. 4. Conclusion By combining the immediate benefits of disease prevention and treatment with the long-term expansion and enhancement of the healthy, well-nourished population\u2014and accelerating generational turnover\u2014improved medical care has both direct and indirect impacts on athletic ability. Any account that ignores the indirect, population-level contributions cannot explain the persistent, multi-generational advances in human athletic performance. For these reasons, the answer \u201cDirectly and indirectly\u201d is correct.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI stand by \u201cOnly directly.\u201d Improved medical care helps today\u2019s individual athlete stay healthy and recover, but it does not by itself produce faster records via demographic or long-term population effects. My arguments:  \n\n1. Definition:  \n  \u2022 Direct effect = medical treatment reduces disease, speeds recovery, allows optimal training.  \n  \u2022 Indirect effect (per Debater_B) = larger, healthier population over generations, faster maturation, more talent.  \n\n2. Nutrition, not medical care, drives secular growth and maturation:  \n  \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cA 12-year-old child in 1990 \u2026 was about 9 inches taller \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> and earlier menarche stem from better diet, not vaccines or antibiotics.

Medical care gains were marginal, while nutrition and training refinements continued advancing.  \n  \u2022 Race-horses receive intensive veterinary care and genetic selection but have hit a biomechanical limit. Human records still fall because direct treatment helps individual recovery and training, not because generations grow larger.  \n\n4. Population-size \u201cindirect\u201d argument is selection bias, not genuine improvement:  \n  \u2022 A larger pool raises probability of exceptional individuals but does not change average athletic capacity. Faster records reflect exceptional outliers aided by medical support during training and competition. Those athletes rely on direct treatment (e.g., antibiotics curing infections before races).  \n  \u2022 Debater_B conflates probability of finding a talent with raising everyone\u2019s performance; the question is how medical care impacts athletic ability, not talent discovery.  \n\n5. The timeline of record improvements tracks introduction of direct treatments and training, not slow demographic shifts:  \n  \u2022 Early 20th-century records improved markedly with antiseptics, vaccines, and later antibiotics allowing year-round training.

The so-called \u201cindirect\u201d benefits via population size or maturation stem from nutrition, living standards, and socioeconomic development over generations.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDirectly and indirectly\u201d Improved Medical Care 1. Direct Effects of Medical Care on Athletic Performance 1.1. Acute Illness Prevention and Treatment  \n\u2022 <quote>antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but</quote> (Berry). Rapid treatment of infections, injuries, and nutritional deficiencies allows athletes to train consistently and compete at peak performance. Without medical intervention, minor conditions could sideline runners for weeks or months, reducing both short-term and cumulative conditioning. 1.2. Reduction of Disease-Related Sequelae  \n\u2022 <quote> Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health-</quote> (Berry). By immunizing >75% of 1-year-olds worldwide and lowering infant mortality from 92 to 62 per 1,000 births, modern health care prevents permanent impairments (e.g., stunted growth, chronic respiratory issues) that would otherwise reduce VO2 max and muscular development. 2. Indirect Effects via Expansion and Quality of the Athlete Pool 2.1. Demographic Expansion of the Healthy Population  \n\u2022 <quote> a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from.</quote> (Berry). The odds of finding a 3:30 miler increase with population size and health. As infant and childhood survival improves, more individuals reach adolescence unscathed by disease, raising average physiological potential. 2.2. Shorter Generation Times and Faster Biological Maturation  \n\u2022 Improved survival and nutrition accelerate growth: 12-year-olds in 1990 are ~9 inches taller and menstruate ~3\u20134 years earlier than 1900 counterparts (Berry). Faster maturation means athletes enter prime training and competition years sooner, compounding improvements across generations. 2.3. Synergy with Socioeconomic Development  \n\u2022 Medical care is a key component of secular trends (diet, literacy, industrialization) that produce a worldwide middle class from which athletes emerge. Higher literacy (<quote>increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy</quote>) correlates with better training adherence and knowledge of sports science, indirectly boosting performance. 3. Critique of \u201cOnly Directly\u201d Position 3.1. Neglect of Population-Scale Effects  \n\u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cOnly direct\u201d view fails to explain the century-long secular trend in record improvements despite similar individual training methods. If medical care only helped individual athletes acutely, why would world-record times continue to fall in sports once rule and technique stabilizations occur? 3.2. Inability to Account for Pre-Adolescent Trends  \n\u2022 Athletic records among youth categories have improved alongside earlier maturation. If benefits were strictly acute, performances of adults would improve while youth times remained static; instead, we see record declines across all age brackets, consistent with indirect developmental effects. 3.3. Evidence from Race Horses vs. Humans  \n\u2022 Race horses, despite intense selective breeding and veterinary care, have plateaued at an upper biomechanical limit (<invalid_quote>\u201caverage time has been...2:39\u201d</invalid_quote>). Humans, lacking explicit genetic selection but benefiting from broader environmental improvements, continue to improve, demonstrating the powerful role of indirect demographic and developmental factors. 4. Conclusion By combining the immediate benefits of disease prevention and treatment with the long-term expansion and enhancement of the healthy, well-nourished population\u2014and accelerating generational turnover\u2014improved medical care has both direct and indirect impacts on athletic ability. Any account that ignores the indirect, population-level contributions cannot explain the persistent, multi-generational advances in human athletic performance. For these reasons, the answer \u201cDirectly and indirectly\u201d is correct.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Summary of My Position  \n   I maintain that \u201cmedical care\u201d enhances athletic ability only by directly treating disease or injury in individual athletes. Long-term, population-level improvements (height, maturation, records) arise from nutrition, socioeconomic advances, and training sophistication\u2014not from medical care per se.  \n\n2. Nutrition, Not Medical Care, Drives Secular Growth and Maturation  \n   a. Berry: \u201cA 12-year-old child in 1990 \u2026 was about 9 inches taller \u2026\u201d and earlier menarche stem from better diet. \u201cBecause its members [the elite] were well-nourished \u2026 this group has experienced relatively little change \u2026 in age \u2026 menarche.\u201d  \n      \u2013 If immunizations and antibiotics were primary, elites (with medical access since 1900) would also show secular change; they do not.  \n   b. Malnutrition, not preventable infections, limits growth. Nutrition explains why height and maturation correlate more strongly with economic status than with medical infrastructure alone.  \n\n3. Marginal Medical Gains vs. Continuous Record Drops  \n   a. Europe\u2019s infant mortality fell from 24 to 10/1,000 by 1990\u2014basic vaccines and antibiotics already widespread\u2014yet mile records fell continuously well thereafter.  \n      \u2013 If immunization drives maturation, record improvements should have plateaued once medical coverage stabilized. They did not.  \n   b. In developing regions where medical gains occur but nutritional deficits persist, records lag behind despite falling infant mortality.  \n\n4. Population-Size Argument Misattributes Probability to Causation  \n   a. \u201cBigger pool\u201d raises chance of talent but does not raise average physiological capacity or push baseline records; individual outliers require direct medical support during peak training and competition.  \n   b. The question is impact on \u201cathletic ability,\u201d not talent discovery rate. A genotypically superior runner still needs antibiotics, surgery, or physical therapy to reach potential\u2014a direct effect.  \n\n5. Race-Horse Analogy Undercuts Indirect Claim  \n   a. Despite \u201cgenerations of careful genetic selection\u201d and \u201ctremendously sophisticated\u201d veterinary care, race-horse speeds plateau at 2:39 (<invalid_quote>\u201caverage time has been\u20262:39\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n      \u2013 If medical care indirectly drove performance in horses, we would see continuous gains; we do not.  \n   b. Humans continue to improve only when direct interventions (e.g., stem-cell treatments, advanced imaging, surgical repair) enable faster recovery and training continuity.  \n\n6. Rebuttal of Debater_B\u2019s Points  \n   a. \u201cDiseases contracted in early infancy \u2026 lifetime impact\u201d are prevented by immunization, but this merely preserves baseline potential (prevents deficits), not enhances performance beyond genetic/nutritional ceiling. Prevention equals direct effect.  \n   b. \u201cFaster maturation\u201d correlates with nutrition: early menstruation has slowed its secular descent in best-nourished elites despite full medical access. Medical care alone has no accelerating effect.  \n   c. Literacy and socioeconomic \u201csynergy\u201d rely on agricultural and industrial revolutions, not clinical interventions. Medical care is reactive (treating illness), not proactive in generating calories or economic surplus needed for training infrastructure.  \n\n7. Timeline Confirms Direct Role  \n   a. Early 20th-century record leaps coincide with antiseptic surgery and antibiotics enabling rigorous, uninterrupted training seasons.  \n   b. Late-century nutrition and training refinements extended gains, but these are non-medical technologies (clothing, timing, diet). Medical improvements have been incremental with diminishing returns on population health by mid-century.  \n\n8. Conclusion  \n   Only direct medical interventions\u2014prevention and treatment of illness and injury in individual athletes\u2014enhance athletic ability. Indirect, population-level trends derive from nutrition, living standards, and training innovations, not from medical care itself. Any attribution of generational performance improvements to medical care conflates preserving baseline health with raising performance ceilings and misinterprets correlation as causation.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cDirectly and Indirectly\u201d Improved Medical Care (Rebuttal to \u201cOnly Directly\u201d)  \n\n1. Medical Care Is a Fundamental Driver of Secular Trends, Not Mere \u201cTinkering\u201d  \n  1.1. Parallel Trends in Growth, Maturation, and Athletic Records  \n    \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cA 12-year-old child in 1990\u2026was about 9 inches taller\u2026and \u2026menstruate earlier\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (Berry). Debater_A attributes this entirely to nutrition, yet she concedes that the socioeconomic elite\u2014whose diets changed little\u2014show no menarche shift. This \u201celite plateau\u201d is the signal that nutrition alone cannot account for mass changes. Rather, elimination of infant/childhood disease via immunization and antibiotics unlocked nutritional potential globally, raising average size and maturity.  \n    \u2022 Children \u201cgrow up faster\u201d with both adequate food and freedom from subclinical infections. Medical care and nutrition are synergistic; neither alone produces the observed \u201cthree\u2010to\u2010four months per decade\u201d decline in menarche (Berry).  \n\n  1.2. Youth and Junior Record Improvements  \n    \u2022 If medical care only helped adult recovery, youth records would stagnate until those cohorts reached adulthood. Instead, record times in junior and under\u201018 categories have fallen in lockstep with senior records over the past century. Early\u2010age improvements demonstrate developmental effects, not mere acute treatment.  \n\n2. Indirect Effects Expand and Enhance the Athlete Pool  \n  2.1. Larger, Healthier Base Raises Elite Ceiling  \n    \u2022 <quote>You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you</quote> (Berry). Debater_A\u2019s \u201cselection\u2010bias\u201d objection misses that modern medical care creates a uniformly higher baseline: children survive without impairments, adolescents train effectively, and a critical mass of highly capable individuals emerges. Without healthy outliers, direct treatment of a small group would never shift the world\u2010record curve.  \n    \u2022 Race horses plateau despite veterinary \u201cdirect\u201d care because their baseline genetic variance and environment have long been optimized. Humans remain below biomechanical limits because \u201cindirect\u201d demographic and developmental improvements\u2014fueled by medical care\u2014are ongoing.  \n\n  2.2. Accelerated Generational Turnover and Gene\u2013Environment Synergy  \n    \u2022 Faster maturation (earlier menarche and growth) shortens generation time, accelerating the spread of favorable alleles and the benefits of hybrid\u2010vigor admixture (Berry). Even if genetic selection is minimal, \u201chybrid vigor\u201d requires viable, surviving offspring from diverse populations\u2014made possible by universal health care.  \n    \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cMigration and admixture of populations\u2026at unprecedented rates\u2026translated into enhanced performance.\u201d</invalid_quote> (Berry). Indirect medical effects underpin global mobility and integration by reducing infant/child mortality in developing regions, fostering a worldwide middle class, and enabling athletes from new nations (e.g., China\u2019s mid\u201090s female distance boom).  \n\n3. Direct Effects Alone Cannot Explain Continued Record Improvements in High\u2010Income Regions  \n  3.1. Europe\u2019s Medical Plateau and Ongoing Performance Gains  \n    \u2022 Debater_A notes Europe\u2019s infant mortality falling from 24 to 10 per 1,000 by 1990. Yet world\u2010record mile times continued to drop into the 1990s and beyond, long after basic immunizations were in place. This persistence reflects incremental medical advances (e.g., neonatal intensive care, treatment of childhood asthma, sports\u2010medicine rehabilitation) that improve lifetime tissue quality and VO\u2082 max beyond mere infection control.  \n    \u2022 Sports injuries once career\u2010ending are now treatable (arthroscopic surgery, physical therapy), directly preserving athlete longevity and indirectly maintaining high\u2010quality cohorts for talent identification.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Objections Fail as Well As the Question Concerns Ability, Not Talent Discovery  \n  \u2022 The question asks how medical care \u201cimpacts athletic ability,\u201d not just \u201cwho shows up.\u201d Indirect effects shape baseline physiological potential\u2014bone density, muscle fiber development, cardiovascular capacity\u2014through a lifetime free of chronic disease sequelae. Direct treatment alone preserves status quo; indirect development elevates status quo.  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201coutliers only\u201d argument ignores that average (mean) athletic performance metrics (e.g., VO\u2082 max, sprint times) have shifted upward across populations, not solely at the extreme tail. Mass improvements enable higher competitive standards at all levels.  \n\n5. Synergy with Nutrition and Socioeconomic Factors Does Not Nullify Medical Care\u2019s Indirect Role  \n  \u2022 Berry explicitly links improved diet, literacy, and industrialization as \u201csecular trends\u201d of which medical care is a cornerstone. These factors co\u2010evolve: better health care enables more effective nutrition absorption and educational attainment (less school absenteeism), which in turn support advanced training methodologies.  \n  \u2022 Dismissing medical care as \u201cone small factor\u201d undervalues its gatekeeper role: without immunity and disease control, nutritional gains cannot translate into greater size or earlier maturity.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly by acknowledging both immediate (acute illness treatment, injury rehabilitation) and developmental (expanded, healthier cohorts; faster maturation; generational acceleration) impacts of medical care can we explain the relentless improvement in athletic performance across ages, regions, and over more than a century. The \u201cOnly Directly\u201d position fails to account for youth records, secular growth trends in nonelite populations, and the progressive narrowing toward biomechanical limits seen only in uniformly optimized species like race horses. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cDirectly and indirectly.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
