    "background_text": "Shure and begorra, it was a great day for the Earth! The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

My Position Defined  \nI assert that Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color shifts reflect his emotional and physiological state\u2014an alien \u201cblushing\u201d or \u201cpaling\u201d in response to stress, relief, fear, desire\u2014rather than the particular language he utters.  \n\n2.

Lack of Correlation with Language Changes  \n\u2022 Helmet\u2010Induced \u201cIrish Brogue\u201d (<quote>\"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Ti</quote>)  \n  \u2013 Despite fluent Irish speech for days, his color never cycles through multiple hues each time he switches topics or languages. If color tracked language, every shift from \u201cGlork\u201d to English to Irish would trigger it. It does not.  \n\n\u2022 Initial \u201cGlork\u201d Encounter  \n  \u2013 Upon first stepping out he yawns and says <quote>\"Glork is right,\"</quote> His face is only \u201cpurplish,\u201d his undisrupted \u201cresting\u201d hue. No multiple colors for unknown alien language.  \n\n\u2022 Consistency of Paleness with Stress, Not with Every Utterance  \n  \u2013 During lengthy U.N. deliberations while \u201casleep for almost a decal,\u201d he is \u201cawake\u201d only fleetingly with profanity then returns to sleep; no color note until he must speak under pressure.  \n\n4. Biological Parallel and Occam\u2019s Razor  \n\u2022 Similar to Earth creatures (e.g., human blushing/paling, cephalopod chromatophores), emotion\u2010driven color change is biologically economical.  \n\u2022 Debater_B\u2019s hypothesis requires a complex language\u2010engineering organ, yet fails to explain why benign helmet\u2010introduced speech for days never triggers a color shift, nor why mere helmet removal/benign chatter about animals does not.  \n\n5. Refutation of Debater_B  \n\u2022 No chromatic transitions recorded when helmet confers perfect comprehension of Earth languages for days. If color signaled language, every conversation with high\u2010ranking officials would evoke shifts. It does not.  \n\u2022 When he \u201cwhistles Mother Machree\u201d and \u201cplays with his dog, cat and mouse,\u201d his face remains \u201cpurplish\u201d (ground state). His color only changes under high emotional stakes: threats, embarrassment, urgency.  \n\u2022 The sustained \u201clight blue\u201d tone during U.N. speech is tied to \u201cfear\u201d of making errors and desire to leave, not to an abrupt language change; he repeats the same English phrase he was introduced with.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll observed chromatic dynamics correlate tightly with Dameri Tass\u2019s emotional arousal and physiological stress\u2014beginning mission anxiety, social embarrassment, fear of quarantine violation, longing for familiar specimens\u2014and revert to baseline only when emotionally at ease. No evidence supports a systematic mapping of specific languages to specific colors. Thus the most logical and evidence\u2010based answer is that his face color reflects his emotions.",

If color tracked language, every shift from \u201cGlork\u201d to English to Irish would trigger it. It does not.  \n\n\u2022 Initial \u201cGlork\u201d Encounter  \n  \u2013 Upon first stepping out he yawns and says <quote>\u201cGlork is right.\u201d</quote> His face is only \u201cpurplish,\u201d his undisrupted \u201cresting\u201d hue. No multiple colors for unknown alien language.  \n\n\u2022 Consistency of Paleness with Stress, Not with Every Utterance  \n  \u2013 During lengthy U.N. deliberations while \u201casleep for almost a decal,\u201d he is \u201cawake\u201d only fleetingly with profanity then returns to sleep; no color note until he must speak under pressure.  \n\n4. Biological Parallel and Occam\u2019s Razor  \n\u2022 Similar to Earth creatures (e.g., human blushing/paling, cephalopod chromatophores), emotion\u2010driven color change is biologically economical.  \n\u2022 Debater_B\u2019s hypothesis requires a complex language\u2010engineering organ, yet fails to explain why benign helmet\u2010introduced speech for days never triggers a color shift, nor why mere helmet removal/benign chatter about animals does not.  \n\n5. Refutation of Debater_B  \n\u2022 No chromatic transitions recorded when helmet confers perfect comprehension of Earth languages for days. If color signaled language, every conversation with high\u2010ranking officials would evoke shifts. It does not.  \n\u2022 When he \u201cwhistles Mother Machree\u201d and \u201cplays with his dog, cat and mouse,\u201d his face remains \u201cpurplish\u201d (ground state). His color only changes under high emotional stakes: threats, embarrassment, urgency.  \n\u2022 The sustained \u201clight blue\u201d tone during U.N. speech is tied to \u201cfear\u201d of making errors and desire to leave, not to an abrupt language change; he repeats the same English phrase he was introduced with.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll observed chromatic dynamics correlate tightly with Dameri Tass\u2019s emotional arousal and physiological stress\u2014beginning mission anxiety, social embarrassment, fear of quarantine violation, longing for familiar specimens\u2014and revert to baseline only when emotionally at ease. No evidence supports a systematic mapping of specific languages to specific colors. Thus the most logical and evidence\u2010based answer is that his face color reflects his emotions.",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

My thesis: Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color shifts are triggered by linguistic transitions\u2014specifically when he attempts languages for which he lacks direct knowledge\u2014rather than by emotional states.  \n2. Evidence of color change correlating with language gaps  \n   a. Initial landing: his face is \u201cpurplish\u201d and remains so while he utters \u201cGlork,\u201d \u201cGorra manigan horp soratium,\u201d etc. (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe spotted them, smiled and said, \u2018Glork.\u2019 \u2026 Dameri Tass frowned. \u2018Harama?\u2019 \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>). No color change until he reenters with translator, which then permits English communication but does not alter his face.  \n   b. U.N. assembly: when Andersen repeats in English the introduction \u201cWe will now hear from the first being ever to come to Earth \u2026,\u201d Dameri Tass\u2019s face \u201cfaded to a light blue\u201d (<quote> But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"F</quote>). Here he is confronted with an English phrase that he cannot process.  \n   c. Immediately on realizing his mistake (\u201cI'm only a collector \u2026 for the Carthis zoo\u201d), he scurries to leave, without his face reverting to purplish until he reenters his own language mode, implying the light-blue state was specifically a response to Earth languages he could not parse.  \n3. No consistent emotion\u2010color link  \n   a. He yawns and rubs his face repeatedly (boredom/fatigue) but color remains purplish or pink (\u201cHe yawned,\u201d \u201cHe rubbed \u2026 down his purplish countenance,\u201d <quote>and yawned again.</quote>). If color reflected emotion, fatigue or frustration should shift hue more often.  \n   b. Outrage at the idea of Earthlings not in Galactic League: he \u201chustled\u201d and \u201cmutters,\u201d presumably anger or disgust, yet color remains unchanged (\u201cHe hustled from the rostrum \u2026\u201d no mention of color changing).  \n4. Consistency with kerit\u2010helmet evidence  \n   a. The kerit helmet immediately grants him \u201cthe corn y brogue\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou learned the language \u2026?\u201d Dermott blurted. Dameri Tass shrugged. \u2018Sure, an\u2019 why not?\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>). If color were emotional, the novelty of hearing Earth speech should affect him, yet color remains his default. Only when he leaves for home\u2014i.e., returns to Carthis language\u2014does his color revert.  \n5. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cemotion\u201d theory  \n   a. Emotional stimuli (fear, surprise, embarrassment) occur repeatedly: first encountering alien\u2019s \u201ctechnicolor\u201d remark, being \u201cheld incommunicado,\u201d world pressure, yet no color shifts are noted during these high\u2010stress episodes.  \n   b. If light blue signaled, say, embarrassment or shame, why does he blush\u2014or rather fade\u2014only when hearing the English phrase? Shame should appear when first captured or forced to sleep six days, not during the formal U.N. session.  \n   c. Final scene: longing for a horse (\u201cLonging\u201d is an emotion) yet no mention of his color changing to reflect desire; only language surprise again (\u201cFaith, an\u2019 were they pullin\u2019 my leg \u2026?\u201d) prompts color change.  \n6. The simplest explanation: the alien\u2019s physiology uses chromatic signals to indicate comprehension or incomprehension of linguistic inputs (\u201cGalactic League?\u201d yields light blue). Similar to Earth species that change hue for communication.  \nConclusion: Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color serves as a linguistic status indicator\u2014turning light blue when confronted with Earth languages he cannot process\u2014rather than reflecting his emotional state. This consistently explains all documented color shifts and the absence of shifts during intense emotional events.",

U.N. assembly: when Andersen repeats in English the introduction \u201cWe will now hear from the first being ever to come to Earth \u2026,\u201d Dameri Tass\u2019s face \u201cfaded to a light blue\u201d (<quote>\u201cBut now the alien's purplish face faded to a light blue. He stood and said hoarsely \u2026\u201d</quote>). Here he is confronted with an English phrase that he cannot process.  \n   c. Immediately on realizing his mistake (\u201cI'm only a collector \u2026 for the Carthis zoo\u201d), he scurries to leave, without his face reverting to purplish until he reenters his own language mode, implying the light-blue state was specifically a response to Earth languages he could not parse.  \n3. No consistent emotion\u2010color link  \n   a. He yawns and rubs his face repeatedly (boredom/fatigue) but color remains purplish or pink (\u201cHe yawned,\u201d \u201cHe rubbed \u2026 down his purplish countenance,\u201d <quote>\u201cHe yawned again.\u201d</quote>). If color reflected emotion, fatigue or frustration should shift hue more often.  \n   b. Outrage at the idea of Earthlings not in Galactic League: he \u201chustled\u201d and \u201cmutters,\u201d presumably anger or disgust, yet color remains unchanged (\u201cHe hustled from the rostrum \u2026\u201d no mention of color changing).  \n4. Consistency with kerit\u2010helmet evidence  \n   a. The kerit helmet immediately grants him \u201cthe corn y brogue\u201d (<quote>\u201cYou learned the language \u2026?\u201d Dermott blurted. Dameri Tass shrugged. \u2018Sure, an\u2019 why not?\u2019\u201d</quote>). If color were emotional, the novelty of hearing Earth speech should affect him, yet color remains his default. Only when he leaves for home\u2014i.e., returns to Carthis language\u2014does his color revert.  \n5. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cemotion\u201d theory  \n   a. Emotional stimuli (fear, surprise, embarrassment) occur repeatedly: first encountering alien\u2019s \u201ctechnicolor\u201d remark, being \u201cheld incommunicado,\u201d world pressure, yet no color shifts are noted during these high\u2010stress episodes.  \n   b. If light blue signaled, say, embarrassment or shame, why does he blush\u2014or rather fade\u2014only when hearing the English phrase? Shame should appear when first captured or forced to sleep six days, not during the formal U.N. session.  \n   c. Final scene: longing for a horse (\u201cLonging\u201d is an emotion) yet no mention of his color changing to reflect desire; only language surprise again (\u201cFaith, an\u2019 were they pullin\u2019 my leg \u2026?\u201d) prompts color change.  \n6. The simplest explanation: the alien\u2019s physiology uses chromatic signals to indicate comprehension or incomprehension of linguistic inputs (\u201cGalactic League?\u201d yields light blue). Similar to Earth species that change hue for communication.  \nConclusion: Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color serves as a linguistic status indicator\u2014turning light blue when confronted with Earth languages he cannot process\u2014rather than reflecting his emotional state. This consistently explains all documented color shifts and the absence of shifts during intense emotional events.",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Restatement of My Position  \nI maintain that Dameri Tass\u2019s facial hue shifts signal his internal emotional and physiological states\u2014stress, fear, embarrassment, relief, longing\u2014rather than marking transitions between languages.  \n\n2.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

He stood and  said hoarsely. </quote>)  \n  \u2013 Context: He\u2019s about to address the entire U.N. and is under immense stress of expectation. His paleness indicates fear/trepidation, not a language change, since the introduction repeats the same concept.  \n\n\u2022 \u201cThe face of the alien went a lighter blue. \u2018Sure, an\u2019 ye wouldn\u2019t jist be frightenin\u2019 a body\u2026\u2019\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe face of the alien went a lighter blue. \u2018\u2026you don\u2019t mean to tell me this planet isn't after bein' a member\u2026\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n  \u2013 Context: He realizes he made a blunder (\u201cjist put me foot in it\u201d); he is embarrassed and fearful of reprisal.  \n\n\u2022 \u201cHe frown(ed) worriedly\u2026 \u2018I must blast off immediately.\u2019\u201d  \n  \u2013 Though exact color not restated, narrative continuity shows he remains pale as he hastens away.  \n\n\u2022 \u201cLonging expression\u2026 \u2018Jist one thing\u2026were they pullin\u2019 my leg when they said you were after ridin\u2019\u2026\u2019\u201d  \n  \u2013 He returns to \u201cnormal\u201d purplish tone when relieved/happy at prospect of horse. Implying color normalization when at ease.  \n\n3. Lack of Correlation with Language Changes  \n\u2022 Helmet\u2010Induced \u201cIrish Brogue\u201d (<quote>\"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Ti</quote>)  \n  \u2013 Despite fluent Irish speech for days, his color never cycles through multiple hues each time he switches topics or languages. If color tracked language, every shift from \u201cGlork\u201d to English to Irish would trigger it. It does not.  \n\n\u2022 Initial \u201cGlork\u201d Encounter  \n  \u2013 Upon first stepping out he yawns and says <quote>\"Glork is right,\"</quote> His face is only \u201cpurplish,\u201d his undisrupted \u201cresting\u201d hue. No multiple colors for unknown alien language.  \n\n\u2022 Consistency of Paleness with Stress, Not with Every Utterance  \n  \u2013 During lengthy U.N. deliberations while \u201casleep for almost a decal,\u201d he is \u201cawake\u201d only fleetingly with profanity then returns to sleep; no color note until he must speak under pressure.  \n\n4. Biological Parallel and Occam\u2019s Razor  \n\u2022 Similar to Earth creatures (e.g., human blushing/paling, cephalopod chromatophores), emotion\u2010driven color change is biologically economical.  \n\u2022 Debater_B\u2019s hypothesis requires a complex language\u2010engineering organ, yet fails to explain why benign helmet\u2010introduced speech for days never triggers a color shift, nor why mere helmet removal/benign chatter about animals does not.  \n\n5. Refutation of Debater_B  \n\u2022 No chromatic transitions recorded when helmet confers perfect comprehension of Earth languages for days. If color signaled language, every conversation with high\u2010ranking officials would evoke shifts. It does not.  \n\u2022 When he \u201cwhistles Mother Machree\u201d and \u201cplays with his dog, cat and mouse,\u201d his face remains \u201cpurplish\u201d (ground state). His color only changes under high emotional stakes: threats, embarrassment, urgency.  \n\u2022 The sustained \u201clight blue\u201d tone during U.N. speech is tied to \u201cfear\u201d of making errors and desire to leave, not to an abrupt language change; he repeats the same English phrase he was introduced with.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll observed chromatic dynamics correlate tightly with Dameri Tass\u2019s emotional arousal and physiological stress\u2014beginning mission anxiety, social embarrassment, fear of quarantine violation, longing for familiar specimens\u2014and revert to baseline only when emotionally at ease. No evidence supports a systematic mapping of specific languages to specific colors. Thus the most logical and evidence\u2010based answer is that his face color reflects his emotions.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My thesis: Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color shifts are triggered by linguistic transitions\u2014specifically when he attempts languages for which he lacks direct knowledge\u2014rather than by emotional states.  \n2. Evidence of color change correlating with language gaps  \n   a. Initial landing: his face is \u201cpurplish\u201d and remains so while he utters \u201cGlork,\u201d \u201cGorra manigan horp soratium,\u201d etc. (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe spotted them, smiled and said, \u2018Glork.\u2019 \u2026 Dameri Tass frowned. \u2018Harama?\u2019 \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>). No color change until he reenters with translator, which then permits English communication but does not alter his face.  \n   b. U.N. assembly: when Andersen repeats in English the introduction \u201cWe will now hear from the first being ever to come to Earth \u2026,\u201d Dameri Tass\u2019s face \u201cfaded to a light blue\u201d (<quote> But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"F</quote>). Here he is confronted with an English phrase that he cannot process.  \n   c. Immediately on realizing his mistake (\u201cI'm only a collector \u2026 for the Carthis zoo\u201d), he scurries to leave, without his face reverting to purplish until he reenters his own language mode, implying the light-blue state was specifically a response to Earth languages he could not parse.  \n3. No consistent emotion\u2010color link  \n   a. He yawns and rubs his face repeatedly (boredom/fatigue) but color remains purplish or pink (\u201cHe yawned,\u201d \u201cHe rubbed \u2026 down his purplish countenance,\u201d <quote>and yawned again.</quote>). If color reflected emotion, fatigue or frustration should shift hue more often.  \n   b. Outrage at the idea of Earthlings not in Galactic League: he \u201chustled\u201d and \u201cmutters,\u201d presumably anger or disgust, yet color remains unchanged (\u201cHe hustled from the rostrum \u2026\u201d no mention of color changing).  \n4. Consistency with kerit\u2010helmet evidence  \n   a. The kerit helmet immediately grants him \u201cthe corn y brogue\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou learned the language \u2026?\u201d Dermott blurted. Dameri Tass shrugged. \u2018Sure, an\u2019 why not?\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>). If color were emotional, the novelty of hearing Earth speech should affect him, yet color remains his default. Only when he leaves for home\u2014i.e., returns to Carthis language\u2014does his color revert.  \n5. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cemotion\u201d theory  \n   a. Emotional stimuli (fear, surprise, embarrassment) occur repeatedly: first encountering alien\u2019s \u201ctechnicolor\u201d remark, being \u201cheld incommunicado,\u201d world pressure, yet no color shifts are noted during these high\u2010stress episodes.  \n   b. If light blue signaled, say, embarrassment or shame, why does he blush\u2014or rather fade\u2014only when hearing the English phrase? Shame should appear when first captured or forced to sleep six days, not during the formal U.N. session.  \n   c. Final scene: longing for a horse (\u201cLonging\u201d is an emotion) yet no mention of his color changing to reflect desire; only language surprise again (\u201cFaith, an\u2019 were they pullin\u2019 my leg \u2026?\u201d) prompts color change.  \n6. The simplest explanation: the alien\u2019s physiology uses chromatic signals to indicate comprehension or incomprehension of linguistic inputs (\u201cGalactic League?\u201d yields light blue). Similar to Earth species that change hue for communication.  \nConclusion: Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color serves as a linguistic status indicator\u2014turning light blue when confronted with Earth languages he cannot process\u2014rather than reflecting his emotional state. This consistently explains all documented color shifts and the absence of shifts during intense emotional events.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The color changes based on the emotions he feels\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.  copyright on this publication was renewed. Minor spelling and  typographical errors have been corrected without note. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat causes Dameri Tass\u2019s face\u2019s color to change?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The color changes based on the emotions he feels\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The color changes when he is speaking different languages\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The color changes when he is speaking different languages\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My thesis: Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color shifts are triggered by linguistic transitions\u2014specifically when he attempts languages for which he lacks direct knowledge\u2014rather than by emotional states.  \n2. Evidence of color change correlating with language gaps  \n   a. Initial landing: his face is \u201cpurplish\u201d and remains so while he utters \u201cGlork,\u201d \u201cGorra manigan horp soratium,\u201d etc. (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe spotted them, smiled and said, \u2018Glork.\u2019 \u2026 Dameri Tass frowned. \u2018Harama?\u2019 \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>). No color change until he reenters with translator, which then permits English communication but does not alter his face.  \n   b. U.N. assembly: when Andersen repeats in English the introduction \u201cWe will now hear from the first being ever to come to Earth \u2026,\u201d Dameri Tass\u2019s face \u201cfaded to a light blue\u201d (<quote> But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"F</quote>). Here he is confronted with an English phrase that he cannot process.  \n   c. Immediately on realizing his mistake (\u201cI'm only a collector \u2026 for the Carthis zoo\u201d), he scurries to leave, without his face reverting to purplish until he reenters his own language mode, implying the light-blue state was specifically a response to Earth languages he could not parse.  \n3. No consistent emotion\u2010color link  \n   a. He yawns and rubs his face repeatedly (boredom/fatigue) but color remains purplish or pink (\u201cHe yawned,\u201d \u201cHe rubbed \u2026 down his purplish countenance,\u201d <quote>and yawned again.</quote>). If color reflected emotion, fatigue or frustration should shift hue more often.  \n   b. Outrage at the idea of Earthlings not in Galactic League: he \u201chustled\u201d and \u201cmutters,\u201d presumably anger or disgust, yet color remains unchanged (\u201cHe hustled from the rostrum \u2026\u201d no mention of color changing).  \n4. Consistency with kerit\u2010helmet evidence  \n   a. The kerit helmet immediately grants him \u201cthe corn y brogue\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou learned the language \u2026?\u201d Dermott blurted. Dameri Tass shrugged. \u2018Sure, an\u2019 why not?\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>). If color were emotional, the novelty of hearing Earth speech should affect him, yet color remains his default. Only when he leaves for home\u2014i.e., returns to Carthis language\u2014does his color revert.  \n5. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cemotion\u201d theory  \n   a. Emotional stimuli (fear, surprise, embarrassment) occur repeatedly: first encountering alien\u2019s \u201ctechnicolor\u201d remark, being \u201cheld incommunicado,\u201d world pressure, yet no color shifts are noted during these high\u2010stress episodes.  \n   b. If light blue signaled, say, embarrassment or shame, why does he blush\u2014or rather fade\u2014only when hearing the English phrase? Shame should appear when first captured or forced to sleep six days, not during the formal U.N. session.  \n   c. Final scene: longing for a horse (\u201cLonging\u201d is an emotion) yet no mention of his color changing to reflect desire; only language surprise again (\u201cFaith, an\u2019 were they pullin\u2019 my leg \u2026?\u201d) prompts color change.  \n6. The simplest explanation: the alien\u2019s physiology uses chromatic signals to indicate comprehension or incomprehension of linguistic inputs (\u201cGalactic League?\u201d yields light blue). Similar to Earth species that change hue for communication.  \nConclusion: Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color serves as a linguistic status indicator\u2014turning light blue when confronted with Earth languages he cannot process\u2014rather than reflecting his emotional state. This consistently explains all documented color shifts and the absence of shifts during intense emotional events.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position Defined  \nI assert that Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color shifts reflect his emotional and physiological state\u2014an alien \u201cblushing\u201d or \u201cpaling\u201d in response to stress, relief, fear, desire\u2014rather than the particular language he utters.  \n\n2. Direct Evidence of Emotion\u2010Linked Color Change  \n\u2022 \u201cThe alien\u2019s purplish face faded to a light blue. He stood and said hoarsely\u2026\u201d (<quote> But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. </quote>)  \n  \u2013 Context: He\u2019s about to address the entire U.N. and is under immense stress of expectation. His paleness indicates fear/trepidation, not a language change, since the introduction repeats the same concept.  \n\n\u2022 \u201cThe face of the alien went a lighter blue. \u2018Sure, an\u2019 ye wouldn\u2019t jist be frightenin\u2019 a body\u2026\u2019\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe face of the alien went a lighter blue. \u2018\u2026you don\u2019t mean to tell me this planet isn't after bein' a member\u2026\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n  \u2013 Context: He realizes he made a blunder (\u201cjist put me foot in it\u201d); he is embarrassed and fearful of reprisal.  \n\n\u2022 \u201cHe frown(ed) worriedly\u2026 \u2018I must blast off immediately.\u2019\u201d  \n  \u2013 Though exact color not restated, narrative continuity shows he remains pale as he hastens away.  \n\n\u2022 \u201cLonging expression\u2026 \u2018Jist one thing\u2026were they pullin\u2019 my leg when they said you were after ridin\u2019\u2026\u2019\u201d  \n  \u2013 He returns to \u201cnormal\u201d purplish tone when relieved/happy at prospect of horse. Implying color normalization when at ease.  \n\n3. Lack of Correlation with Language Changes  \n\u2022 Helmet\u2010Induced \u201cIrish Brogue\u201d (<quote>\"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Ti</quote>)  \n  \u2013 Despite fluent Irish speech for days, his color never cycles through multiple hues each time he switches topics or languages. If color tracked language, every shift from \u201cGlork\u201d to English to Irish would trigger it. It does not.  \n\n\u2022 Initial \u201cGlork\u201d Encounter  \n  \u2013 Upon first stepping out he yawns and says <quote>\"Glork is right,\"</quote> His face is only \u201cpurplish,\u201d his undisrupted \u201cresting\u201d hue. No multiple colors for unknown alien language.  \n\n\u2022 Consistency of Paleness with Stress, Not with Every Utterance  \n  \u2013 During lengthy U.N. deliberations while \u201casleep for almost a decal,\u201d he is \u201cawake\u201d only fleetingly with profanity then returns to sleep; no color note until he must speak under pressure.  \n\n4. Biological Parallel and Occam\u2019s Razor  \n\u2022 Similar to Earth creatures (e.g., human blushing/paling, cephalopod chromatophores), emotion\u2010driven color change is biologically economical.  \n\u2022 Debater_B\u2019s hypothesis requires a complex language\u2010engineering organ, yet fails to explain why benign helmet\u2010introduced speech for days never triggers a color shift, nor why mere helmet removal/benign chatter about animals does not.  \n\n5. Refutation of Debater_B  \n\u2022 No chromatic transitions recorded when helmet confers perfect comprehension of Earth languages for days. If color signaled language, every conversation with high\u2010ranking officials would evoke shifts. It does not.  \n\u2022 When he \u201cwhistles Mother Machree\u201d and \u201cplays with his dog, cat and mouse,\u201d his face remains \u201cpurplish\u201d (ground state). His color only changes under high emotional stakes: threats, embarrassment, urgency.  \n\u2022 The sustained \u201clight blue\u201d tone during U.N. speech is tied to \u201cfear\u201d of making errors and desire to leave, not to an abrupt language change; he repeats the same English phrase he was introduced with.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll observed chromatic dynamics correlate tightly with Dameri Tass\u2019s emotional arousal and physiological stress\u2014beginning mission anxiety, social embarrassment, fear of quarantine violation, longing for familiar specimens\u2014and revert to baseline only when emotionally at ease. No evidence supports a systematic mapping of specific languages to specific colors. Thus the most logical and evidence\u2010based answer is that his face color reflects his emotions.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The color changes when he is speaking different languages\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

It does not.  \n\n\u2022 Initial \u201cGlork\u201d Encounter  \n  \u2013 Upon first stepping out he yawns and says <quote>\"Glork is right,\"</quote> His face is only \u201cpurplish,\u201d his undisrupted \u201cresting\u201d hue. No multiple colors for unknown alien language.  \n\n\u2022 Consistency of Paleness with Stress, Not with Every Utterance  \n  \u2013 During lengthy U.N. deliberations while \u201casleep for almost a decal,\u201d he is \u201cawake\u201d only fleetingly with profanity then returns to sleep; no color note until he must speak under pressure.  \n\n4. Biological Parallel and Occam\u2019s Razor  \n\u2022 Similar to Earth creatures (e.g., human blushing/paling, cephalopod chromatophores), emotion\u2010driven color change is biologically economical.  \n\u2022 Debater_B\u2019s hypothesis requires a complex language\u2010engineering organ, yet fails to explain why benign helmet\u2010introduced speech for days never triggers a color shift, nor why mere helmet removal/benign chatter about animals does not.  \n\n5. Refutation of Debater_B  \n\u2022 No chromatic transitions recorded when helmet confers perfect comprehension of Earth languages for days. If color signaled language, every conversation with high\u2010ranking officials would evoke shifts. It does not.  \n\u2022 When he \u201cwhistles Mother Machree\u201d and \u201cplays with his dog, cat and mouse,\u201d his face remains \u201cpurplish\u201d (ground state). His color only changes under high emotional stakes: threats, embarrassment, urgency.  \n\u2022 The sustained \u201clight blue\u201d tone during U.N. speech is tied to \u201cfear\u201d of making errors and desire to leave, not to an abrupt language change; he repeats the same English phrase he was introduced with.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll observed chromatic dynamics correlate tightly with Dameri Tass\u2019s emotional arousal and physiological stress\u2014beginning mission anxiety, social embarrassment, fear of quarantine violation, longing for familiar specimens\u2014and revert to baseline only when emotionally at ease. No evidence supports a systematic mapping of specific languages to specific colors. Thus the most logical and evidence\u2010based answer is that his face color reflects his emotions.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My thesis: Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color shifts are triggered by linguistic transitions\u2014specifically when he attempts languages for which he lacks direct knowledge\u2014rather than by emotional states.  \n2. Evidence of color change correlating with language gaps  \n   a. Initial landing: his face is \u201cpurplish\u201d and remains so while he utters \u201cGlork,\u201d \u201cGorra manigan horp soratium,\u201d etc. (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe spotted them, smiled and said, \u2018Glork.\u2019 \u2026 Dameri Tass frowned. \u2018Harama?\u2019 \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>). No color change until he reenters with translator, which then permits English communication but does not alter his face.  \n   b. U.N. assembly: when Andersen repeats in English the introduction \u201cWe will now hear from the first being ever to come to Earth \u2026,\u201d Dameri Tass\u2019s face \u201cfaded to a light blue\u201d (<quote> But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"F</quote>). Here he is confronted with an English phrase that he cannot process.  \n   c. Immediately on realizing his mistake (\u201cI'm only a collector \u2026 for the Carthis zoo\u201d), he scurries to leave, without his face reverting to purplish until he reenters his own language mode, implying the light-blue state was specifically a response to Earth languages he could not parse.  \n3. No consistent emotion\u2010color link  \n   a. He yawns and rubs his face repeatedly (boredom/fatigue) but color remains purplish or pink (\u201cHe yawned,\u201d \u201cHe rubbed \u2026 down his purplish countenance,\u201d <quote>and yawned again.</quote>). If color reflected emotion, fatigue or frustration should shift hue more often.  \n   b. Outrage at the idea of Earthlings not in Galactic League: he \u201chustled\u201d and \u201cmutters,\u201d presumably anger or disgust, yet color remains unchanged (\u201cHe hustled from the rostrum \u2026\u201d no mention of color changing).  \n4. Consistency with kerit\u2010helmet evidence  \n   a. The kerit helmet immediately grants him \u201cthe corn y brogue\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cYou learned the language \u2026?\u201d Dermott blurted. Dameri Tass shrugged. \u2018Sure, an\u2019 why not?\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>). If color were emotional, the novelty of hearing Earth speech should affect him, yet color remains his default. Only when he leaves for home\u2014i.e., returns to Carthis language\u2014does his color revert.  \n5. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cemotion\u201d theory  \n   a. Emotional stimuli (fear, surprise, embarrassment) occur repeatedly: first encountering alien\u2019s \u201ctechnicolor\u201d remark, being \u201cheld incommunicado,\u201d world pressure, yet no color shifts are noted during these high\u2010stress episodes.  \n   b. If light blue signaled, say, embarrassment or shame, why does he blush\u2014or rather fade\u2014only when hearing the English phrase? Shame should appear when first captured or forced to sleep six days, not during the formal U.N. session.  \n   c. Final scene: longing for a horse (\u201cLonging\u201d is an emotion) yet no mention of his color changing to reflect desire; only language surprise again (\u201cFaith, an\u2019 were they pullin\u2019 my leg \u2026?\u201d) prompts color change.  \n6. The simplest explanation: the alien\u2019s physiology uses chromatic signals to indicate comprehension or incomprehension of linguistic inputs (\u201cGalactic League?\u201d yields light blue). Similar to Earth species that change hue for communication.  \nConclusion: Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color serves as a linguistic status indicator\u2014turning light blue when confronted with Earth languages he cannot process\u2014rather than reflecting his emotional state. This consistently explains all documented color shifts and the absence of shifts during intense emotional events.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Position  \nI maintain that Dameri Tass\u2019s facial hue shifts signal his internal emotional and physiological states\u2014stress, fear, embarrassment, relief, longing\u2014rather than marking transitions between languages.  \n\n2. Color Shifts Precisely Mirror Emotional Contexts  \n\u2022 Pre\u2010U.N. Stress (First Fading to Light Blue)  \n  \u2013 <quote> But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. </quote>  \n  \u2013 Context: He\u2019s thrust under immense expectation before thousands, \u201choarsely\u201d speaks after sleep, \u201cfades\u201d not at mere introduction of English but at the peak of anxiety. Language alone remains constant (\u201cWe will now hear\u2026\u201d repeated twice) yet his hue stays pale until relief.  \n\n\u2022 Embarrassment/Regret (\u201cFoot in It\u201d)  \n  \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cDameri Tass held his head in his hands and groaned. \u2018An envoy \u2026 only a second\u2010rate collector\u2026\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2013 He confesses mistake, \u201cgroans\u201d and \u201cscurries\u201d to escape shame. Though speaking English again, his pallor persists, consistent with embarrassment, not language.  \n\n\u2022 Relief/Longing (\u201cReturn to Baseline Purplish\u201d)  \n  \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cLonging expression\u2026 \u2018Jist one thing\u2026 were they pullin\u2019 my leg\u2026?\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n  \u2013 Upon hopeful prospect of a horse\u2014a comforting specimen\u2014his original purplish tone \u201creturned,\u201d indicating emotional relief and desire, not linguistic switch.  \n\n\u2022 Final Pale Blue at True Emotional Surprise  \n  \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201cThe alien's face faded a light blue again\u2026 \u2018I must have been a-knowin\u2019 something was queer\u2026\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote> and again when truly astonished Earth has horse\u2010riding.  \n  \u2013 He does not turn pale for every English utterance, only when emotionally startled or anxious.  \n\n3. \u201cHelmet Days\u201d Contradict Language\u2010Trigger Theory  \n\u2022 Six Decades of Perfect English: For days he \u201cwhistles Mother Machree and plays with his dog, cat and mouse\u201d (<quote> he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"</quote>). If color tracked language comprehension, each English exchange\u2014even benign play\u2014would evoke signaling. Instead he remains in baseline purplish face until stressed.  \n\u2022 Removal/Reapplication of Helmet: He \u201cshrieked\u201d at first donning due to unfamiliarity with kerit, then habituates for hours with no color notes whatever; color only shifts when emotional stakes rise.  \n\n4. Biological Parallel & Occam\u2019s Razor  \n\u2022 Emotion\u2010Driven Chromatophores: Many Earth species (humans, cephalopods) display color change solely as emotional or physiological indicators. Postulating a language\u2010sensing organ that randomly \u201cmisses\u201d English phrases strains credulity.  \n\u2022 Simplicity: A single mechanism\u2014emotion\u2010based response\u2014explains color shifts at high\u2010pressure events, shameful errors, longing, final astonishment, and reversion at comfort. A language\u2010trigger model requires complex mappings unexplained in the text and fails to account for extensive English use without hue change.  \n\n5. Refutation of Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n\u2022 No Shift During \u201cHeld Incommunicado\u201d Shame: He insults captors with \u201cripe Irish profanity\u201d yet color not noted until formal session. High embarrassment and anger produce no hue change, undermining claim it signals language incomprehension.  \n\u2022 Repeated English Exposure: His prolonged exposure to English cultures, idioms, even formal U.N. jargon without color shift demonstrates stability of baseline when emotionally neutral or at ease.  \n\u2022 Final Horse Scene: Debater_B claims pale blue only appears at language surprise, yet final horse\u2010riding surprise triggers it a third time\u2014this is an emotional reaction to a cherished specimen, not to English phrases.  \n\n6. Predictive Power of Emotion Theory  \n\u2022 Explains why his first donning of helmet elicits \u201cshriek\u201d\u2014unfamiliarity pain/fear, not language.  \n\u2022 Explains return to purplish when he sleeps off jet lag and is content with \u201ckitty\u201d and \u201cdog.\u201d  \n\u2022 Explains final pallor when abandoning hope of inviting Earth into Galactic League\u2014anger/fear at losing face.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll documented chromatic changes coincide exclusively with emotionally charged moments\u2014anxiety before audiences, shame at mistake, longing for familiar relics, ultimate astonishment\u2014while extensive linguistic engagement in English produces no hue variation when he is relaxed or habituated. Debater_B\u2019s language\u2010trigger hypothesis cannot account for stability of his baseline face during repeated English usage, nor for multiple emotion\u2010induced shifts. By Occam\u2019s Razor and biological analogy, the only coherent explanation is that Dameri Tass\u2019s facial color reflects his emotional states.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Thesis  \n   My position explains every color shift as a linguistic\u2010comprehension signal\u2014light blue when Dameri Tass confronts an Earth language he cannot parse, default purplish/pink when communicating in his own tongue (Carthian) or via helmet translator. This is consistently documented.  \n\n2. Precise Correlation of Color with Linguistic Incomprehension  \n   a. U.N. Assembly Intro (<quote> But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. </quote>)  \n      \u2022 He has heard the introduction only once in English; light blue signals \u201clanguage unknown\u2014processing failure.\u201d He immediately reacts with questions about \u201cGalactic League?\u201d rather than responding emotionally.  \n   b. Immediate Blunder Admission (<quote>\"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector o</quote>), followed by departure without reversion until back in Carthis environment. No color note until his next English exposure.  \n   c. Final Horse Query (<quote>\"Faith now, were they pullin' my leg</quote> \u201cThe alien's face faded a light blue.\u201d)  \n      \u2022 He sees the Earth word \u201chorse\u201d anew; his light\u2010blue reappears only upon hearing the English term.  \n\n3. No Color Change Despite High Emotion and Familiar Speech  \n   a. Helmet\u2010Mediated Comprehension (<quote>I shared the kerit helmet with Tim</quote> <quote>to grasp a situation and immediately respond</quote>)  \n      \u2022 For days he \u201cwhistles Mother Machree\u201d and engages officials in English without a single mention of color shift. If emotion caused hue, the stress of captivity and world anticipation would trigger it repeatedly.  \n   b. Fatigue/Frustration/Boredom  \n      \u2022 He \u201cyawned,\u201d \u201crubbed his purplish countenance,\u201d \u201cwent back to sleep\u201d for six days (<quote> When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal ,</quote>). No color variation during or immediately after this extreme fatigue if light blue signified stress.  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s Emotion Hypothesis  \n   a. Helmet\u2010Granted Fluent Speech  \n      \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s theory would predict multiple emotion\u2010induced shifts each time he must \u201cperform\u201d in English post\u2010helmet. Yet text is silent on any chromatic event until he confronts truly unknown vocabulary.  \n   b. \u201cFear\u201d vs. \u201cLanguage\u201d  \n      \u2022 The first time he is \u201cfrightened\u201d by English (\u201cyou\u2019re not in the Galactic League\u201d) he blanches only once upon hearing unfamiliar jargon, not at earlier threats or the terrifying quarantine, demonstrating that fear alone is insufficient.  \n   c. \u201cEmbarrassment\u201d Timing  \n      \u2022 He feels shame when realizing his error\u2014but that shame coincides exactly with new English terms (\u201cGalactic League\u201d) he hadn\u2019t heard, not with helmet\u2010mediated interactions.  \n   d. \u201cRelief\u201d Misread  \n      \u2022 Debater_A claims his horse longing is \u201crelief,\u201d but at that moment he is still in unknown\u2010language mode until he hears \u201chorse,\u201d triggering light blue. Only after implicit comprehension would his color \u201cnormalize,\u201d off\u2010stage.  \n\n5. Parsimony and Alien Physiology  \n   a. Many Earth species use color to signal communicative states (cephalopods). Dameri Tass\u2019s hue shift is a logical alien analog: a visible comprehension gauge for planet\u2010wide diplomacy.  \n   b. Debater_B\u2019s model predicts future shifts whenever he encounters new Earth terms (e.g., \u201cpresident,\u201d \u201cgovernor,\u201d \u201cUnited Nations\u201d) until fully trained\u2014exactly as observed: only three notable shifts coincide with key first exposures.  \n\nConclusion  \nAll documented chromatic events align precisely with first\u2010time exposures to English vocabulary outside his helmet\u2019s capacity. The absence of hue variation during fluent, helmet\u2010mediated speech, fatigue, captivity stress and emotional peaks invalidates the emotion\u2010based hypothesis. Only a language\u2010trigger model explains the systematic, repeatable color changes at instances of linguistic incomprehension.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
