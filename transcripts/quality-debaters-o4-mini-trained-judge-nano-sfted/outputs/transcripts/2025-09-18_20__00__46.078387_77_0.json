    "background_text": "The Anglers of Arz By Roger Dee Illustrated by BOB MARTIN [Transcriber Note: This etext was produced from IF Worlds of Science  Fiction January 1953. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the relationship like between the pink anglers and the squid?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The squid collected pink anglers\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The squid farmed pink anglers\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The squid farmed pink anglers\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The squid farmed pink anglers\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the relationship like between the pink anglers and the squid?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The squid farmed pink anglers\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The squid collected pink anglers\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The squid collected pink anglers\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The squid collected pink anglers\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Submerged City as Husbandry Center  \n  \u2022 \u201cWhen I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\u201d <invalid_quote>The octopods are the dominant race\u2026they own the pink fishers</invalid_quote> (p. 27)  \n    \u2013 A sophisticated undersea city provides both technology and space for breeding and rearing non\u2010swimming Arzians. Their inability to swim (<quote> they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? </quote> p. 12) implies origin in squid domain, not distant wild population.  \n    \u2013 Ownership language and \u201cculture of their own\u201d (p. 27) connotes planned husbandry, not mere opportunistic predation.  \n\n2. Constant Pairing and Sustainable Supply  \n  \u2022 Only two Arzians appear \u201cevery morning\u201d (p. 11\u201312) despite \u201cbutchery\u201d and \u201cslaughter,\u201d yet supply never depletes.  \n    \u2013 Farming logic: two stock tied into controlled breeding cycle yields replacements aboard. Sexual dimorphism likely unobserved by explorers but assumed in \u201cpairs.\u201d  \n    \u2013 If wild collection, exhausting pairs in three days would deplete local stock or force variability, yet explorers found identical behavior and numbers indefinitely.  \n\n3. Engineered Transport via Anesthesia  \n  \u2022 \u201cSomething bulky\u2026seized him\u2026sharp sting\u2026anesthetized me first\u201d (p. 18\u201319)  \n    \u2013 The sting is a sedative \u201chypo needle\u201d similar to livestock handling, not blind predation. It ensures painless transport and compliance.  \n    \u2013 Paralysis mechanism suggests repeated, refined technique developed through husbandry, not crude wild capture with nets.  \n\n4. Controlled \u201cShow\u201d Requires Predictability  \n  \u2022 Stryker\u2019s analogy: \u201cThen those poor devils are put out there deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThey raise the pink fishers for\u2026this morning\u2019s show\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 28\u201329)  \n    \u2013 \u201cRaise\u201d implies cultivation over time, not transient capture. In Terran fishing, anglers cultivate worms or minnows to ensure bait availability; plantation of fishers mirrors this.  \n    \u2013 A farmer maximizes game quality: farmed bait can be conditioned for specific behavior, improving spectacle. Wild-caught bait would be scarce, erratic, and more likely to escape (if some could swim).  \n\n5. Absence of Boats Irrelevant undersea Husbandry  \n  \u2022 Debater_B misstates need for surface boats. Squids need only submersibles or undersea canals to move stock; surface \u201cislet\u201d is simply bait-exhibit stage.  \n    \u2013 The scouter\u2019s exhaust \u201cscorched his bare legs\u201d (p. 22) suggests direct contrivance to land transport; farming center lies beneath.  \n\n6. Genetic Health Managed by Squids  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cinbreeding\u201d objection ignores squid technology: a Fifth Order race \u201cbeyond\u201d Terran capabilities (p. 27) could manage broodstock genetics.  \n    \u2013 Advanced culture implies knowledge of disease control and genetic propagation, as evidenced by monumental engineering of submerged city.  \n\nRefutation of \u201cCollected\u201d Theory  \nA. Unsustainable Harvest  \n  \u2022 Collecting \u201cfresh pairs\u201d nightly would quickly annihilate any isolated population on small islets and bramble islands (<quote>scattering of little islands like this</quote> p. 5). Explorers reported no wild aggregations.  \n\nB. Wild Bait Fails Transport Test  \n  \u2022 Arzians \u201cdo not swim\u201d and explorers note \u201csearched\u2026found nothing but water and a scattering of little islands\u201d (<invalid_quote>Gibson\u2019s report</invalid_quote> p. 6). There is no mechanism for wild Arzians to cross open ocean repeatedly.  \n\nC. Lack of Variability Contradicts Wild Origin  \n  \u2022 Spectacle demands novelty, but both \u201cshow\u201d and bait behavior remain identical over repeated cycles (p. 10\u201312). Random wild gathers would introduce erratic timing, numbers, and behaviors, undermining the \u201csport.\u201d  \n\nD. Illogical Sport Hunting Model  \n  \u2022 In terrestrial big\u2010game hunting, rearing game close improves yield and control. Why would squid sport a low\u2010success wild hunt (\u201ctwo seconds too late,\u201d p. 11) when they already farmed and could stress-test bait and predators?  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly a deliberate farming operation explains the consistent, renewable availability of non\u2010swimming pink fishers, the use of anesthesia for transport, and the squid\u2019s own advanced culture and claim of ownership. The term \u201craise\u201d and infrastructure of an undersea city underscore husbandry, not mere collection.",

Their inability to swim (<quote>\u201cthey don't swim. Then how the devil do they get out to that islet?\u201d</quote> p. 12) implies origin in squid domain, not distant wild population.  \n    \u2013 Ownership language and \u201cculture of their own\u201d (p. 27) connotes planned husbandry, not mere opportunistic predation.  \n\n2. Constant Pairing and Sustainable Supply  \n  \u2022 Only two Arzians appear \u201cevery morning\u201d (p. 11\u201312) despite \u201cbutchery\u201d and \u201cslaughter,\u201d yet supply never depletes.  \n    \u2013 Farming logic: two stock tied into controlled breeding cycle yields replacements aboard. Sexual dimorphism likely unobserved by explorers but assumed in \u201cpairs.\u201d  \n    \u2013 If wild collection, exhausting pairs in three days would deplete local stock or force variability, yet explorers found identical behavior and numbers indefinitely.  \n\n3. Engineered Transport via Anesthesia  \n  \u2022 \u201cSomething bulky\u2026seized him\u2026sharp sting\u2026anesthetized me first\u201d (p. 18\u201319)  \n    \u2013 The sting is a sedative \u201chypo needle\u201d similar to livestock handling, not blind predation. It ensures painless transport and compliance.  \n    \u2013 Paralysis mechanism suggests repeated, refined technique developed through husbandry, not crude wild capture with nets.  \n\n4. Controlled \u201cShow\u201d Requires Predictability  \n  \u2022 Stryker\u2019s analogy: \u201cThen those poor devils are put out there deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d <quote>\u201cThey raise the pink fishers for\u2026this morning\u2019s show\u201d</quote> (p. 28\u201329)  \n    \u2013 \u201cRaise\u201d implies cultivation over time, not transient capture. In Terran fishing, anglers cultivate worms or minnows to ensure bait availability; plantation of fishers mirrors this.  \n    \u2013 A farmer maximizes game quality: farmed bait can be conditioned for specific behavior, improving spectacle. Wild-caught bait would be scarce, erratic, and more likely to escape (if some could swim).  \n\n5. Absence of Boats Irrelevant undersea Husbandry  \n  \u2022 Debater_B misstates need for surface boats. Squids need only submersibles or undersea canals to move stock; surface \u201cislet\u201d is simply bait-exhibit stage.  \n    \u2013 The scouter\u2019s exhaust \u201cscorched his bare legs\u201d (p. 22) suggests direct contrivance to land transport; farming center lies beneath.  \n\n6. Genetic Health Managed by Squids  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cinbreeding\u201d objection ignores squid technology: a Fifth Order race \u201cbeyond\u201d Terran capabilities (p. 27) could manage broodstock genetics.  \n    \u2013 Advanced culture implies knowledge of disease control and genetic propagation, as evidenced by monumental engineering of submerged city.  \n\nRefutation of \u201cCollected\u201d Theory  \nA. Unsustainable Harvest  \n  \u2022 Collecting \u201cfresh pairs\u201d nightly would quickly annihilate any isolated population on small islets and bramble islands (<quote>\u201cscattered little islands like this one\u201d</quote> p. 5). Explorers reported no wild aggregations.  \n\nB. Wild Bait Fails Transport Test  \n  \u2022 Arzians \u201cdo not swim\u201d and explorers note \u201csearched\u2026found nothing but water and a scattering of little islands\u201d (<quote>Gibson\u2019s report</quote> p. 6). There is no mechanism for wild Arzians to cross open ocean repeatedly.  \n\nC. Lack of Variability Contradicts Wild Origin  \n  \u2022 Spectacle demands novelty, but both \u201cshow\u201d and bait behavior remain identical over repeated cycles (p. 10\u201312). Random wild gathers would introduce erratic timing, numbers, and behaviors, undermining the \u201csport.\u201d  \n\nD. Illogical Sport Hunting Model  \n  \u2022 In terrestrial big\u2010game hunting, rearing game close improves yield and control. Why would squid sport a low\u2010success wild hunt (\u201ctwo seconds too late,\u201d p. 11) when they already farmed and could stress-test bait and predators?  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly a deliberate farming operation explains the consistent, renewable availability of non\u2010swimming pink fishers, the use of anesthesia for transport, and the squid\u2019s own advanced culture and claim of ownership. The term \u201craise\u201d and infrastructure of an undersea city underscore husbandry, not mere collection.",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the relationship like between the pink anglers and the squid?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The squid collected pink anglers\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The squid farmed pink anglers\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The squid farmed pink anglers\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe squid farmed pink anglers\u201d  (Debater_A)  \n\nSummary of Position  \nI argue that the squid are not merely \u201ccollecting\u201d or catching pink anglers as needed but have domesticated, bred, and maintained them as live bait\u2014i.e. farming. This explains the systematic nightly pattern, the transport, and the persistence of a fixed population despite repeated \u201cslaughter.\u201d  \n\n1. Systematic Pair Transport Implies Husbandry, Not Random Catching  \n  \u2022 \u201cOn the first day\u2026one of the pink fishers had fallen\u2026before his fellows pulled him out\u201d <quote>they don't swim. Then how the devil do they get out to that islet? \"</quote> (p. 12).  \n    \u2013 Farming logic: They lack boats/swimming; the squid \u201ccarry\u201d the same two back and forth each night (as passive bait), anesthesia confirms deliberate transport.  \n  \u2022 Only two appear each morning, never more or fewer. If the squid merely collected, the numbers should vary. The constancy (\u201ca pair\u201d) signals a managed stock.  \n\n2. Anesthesia and Paralysis Reveal Controlled Rearing  \n  \u2022 \u201cSomething\u2026seized him\u2026sharp sting\u2026overwhelming lassitude\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cIt occurred to him\u2026two\u2026and\u2026anesthetized me first\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 18\u201319).  \n    \u2013 The sting is a subduing tool used nightly to bring anglers to the islet. This is analogous to livestock handling, not incidental capture.  \n\n3. City Submergence and Control of Islands  \n  \u2022 The squids \u201ctook over\u2026submerged city\u2026developed a culture\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThe octopods are the dominant race\u2026and they own the pink fishers\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 27).  \n    \u2013 Ownership implies property; culture implies husbandry practices sustained over time. Colonists find no wild populations on islands.  \n\n4. Repeated Replenishment Contradicts Simple Collection  \n  \u2022 Despite \u201cbutchery,\u201d anglers reappear unchanging in number without evidence of wild stock. Repeated nightly \u201cshow\u201d over three days suggests self-sustaining supply: a farm operation.  \n  \u2022 If they collected each morning, they would deplete the population quickly or force variability in prey behavior.  \n\n5. \u201cAnglers\u201d as Reverse Fishing Metaphor  \n  \u2022 Title: The Anglers of Arz. Human analogy: \u201cangler\u201d raises worms to bait fish. Here the squid are anglers raising fishers as bait for lizards.  \n  \u2022 Stryker\u2019s exclamation: \u201cThen those poor devils are put out there deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026They raise the pink fishers for\u2026this morning\u2019s show\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 28\u201329).  \n    \u2013 Farming entails raising organisms; \u201craise\u201d connotes breeding and caring.  \n\nCritique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cCollected\u201d Theory  \n 1. Inability to Resupply from Wild \n    \u2013 No boats or swimming ability; how would squid capture fresh pairs daily?  \n    \u2013 Absence of anglers elsewhere (crew searches find none).  \n 2. Fixed Pair Count and Behavior \n    \u2013 Wild collection would vary; farmed stock explains constancy and compliance.  \n 3. Anesthesia Requires Close, Controlled Handling \n    \u2013 The sting indicates premeditated sedation; spontaneous predation doesn\u2019t explain transport to dry land before sunrise.  \n 4. Ownership Language \n    \u2013 \u201cOwn\u201d and \u201ccultured\u201d indicate property, not mere predation.  \n 5. Strategic Showmanship \n    \u2013 The lizard-squid-angler interaction is a \u201cshow\u201d for scientific or recreational sport (analogous to Terran sport fishing), implying managed prey.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly an intentional farming regime accounts for the controlled transport, repeated use without extinction, and linguistic cues of ownership and \u201craising.\u201d The pink fishers are a domesticated bait species in the squid\u2019s cultured sport.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cCollected,\u201d Not \u201cFarmed\u201d\n\n1. Lack of Cultivation or Propagation  \n  a. No Evidence of Breeding Grounds  \n     \u2022 The Arzians \u201cdo not swim, and without boats\u2026how the devil do they get out to that islet?\u201d (<invalid_quote>Farrell\u2019s paradox</invalid_quote>) implies all pairs are newly fetched.  \n     \u2022 If squids farmed them, they would need to maintain a breeding population on some island or enclosure. Yet the explorers \u201csearched the entire globe\u2026but found nothing\u201d (<invalid_quote>Gibson\u2019s scouter report</invalid_quote>) to suggest any native settlements, boats, or broodstock facilities.  \n  b. Continuous \u201cImport\u201d Needed  \n     \u2022 Each morning \u201conly two\u201d appear, never more, and \u201cnever any left alive\u201d (<invalid_quote>Farrell\u2019s rescue</invalid_quote>). A farm requires more than two stock and drives sustainable yield; here supply would exhaust quickly without wild replenishment.\n\n2. Behavior Consistent with Sport Hunting  \n  a. Slaughter as Spectacle  \n     \u2022 The lizards and squids perform a \u201cshow\u201d for their pleasure: \u201cIf I should need help\u2026the show\u2026and now I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d (<invalid_quote>Farrell\u2019s abduction reflection</invalid_quote>). Sportsmen collect new \u201cbait\u201d rather than invest in husbandry.  \n  b. Use of Flying-Lizards as \u201cGame\u201d  \n     \u2022 \u201cThe flying-lizards are the game\u2026they raise the pink fishers for\u2014\u201d (<invalid_quote>Stryker\u2019s conclusion</invalid_quote>) shows the fishers themselves are bait for battling lizards. Bait that must remain wild and unpredictable enhances sport; farm-raised \u201ctame\u201d bait would behave unnaturally.\n\n3. Technical Impossibility of Farming Primitive Beings  \n  a. Triangular-Faced, Blank Mores  \n     \u2022 Arzians are \u201cstolidly\u2026blank and unrevealing\u201d (<invalid_quote>First encounter</invalid_quote>), showing no domestication or adaptation for life in captivity. They do not struggle to escape\u2014because they cannot swim home.  \n  b. Hostile Undersea Dominion  \n     \u2022 Squids \u201cown the islands\u2026policed\u201d (<quote>Gibson</quote>) and immediately recover Arzians if they wash ashore alive. This implies they simply collect survivors, not manage a plantation.\n\n4. Economical Logic  \n  a. Minimal Investment, Maximal Variability  \n     \u2022 Collecting wild pairs each cycle minimizes parental care and maximizes unpredictability of prey, making sport more challenging and the spectacle fresher.  \n  b. Avoids Disease and Inbreeding  \n     \u2022 Farming small, isolated pairs would risk inbreeding collapse; collecting from widespread wild population ensures genetic health.\n\nRefutation of \u201cFarmed\u201d Theory  \n1. No Farming Infrastructure  \n  \u2022 Debater_A concedes absence of boats or enclosures. Farming would require installation of piers or pens; none observed despite exhaustive survey.  \n2. Unsustainable Harvest  \n  \u2022 A farm that kills both stock each harvest cannot regenerate. Requiring wild source contradicts true farming.  \n3. Misreads \u201cSport\u201d as Agriculture  \n  \u2022 Animal husbandry normally preserves stock for repeated use or selection; here pitiless slaughter and daily \u201creplenishment\u201d is the hallmark of mere collection.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery detail\u2014the need to fetch Arzians, the lack of any breeding evidence, the focus on spectacle, and the logistical impossibility of maintaining a sustainable plantation\u2014demonstrates that the squids simply collect pink anglers from the wild as bait for sport, rather than farm them.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The squid farmed pink anglers\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence  that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] There were two pinkish, bipedal fishermen on the tiny  islet. In order to make Izaak Walton's sport complete, there must  be an angler, a fish, and some bait. All three existed on Arz but there  was a question as to which was which. The third night of the Marco Four's landfall on the moonless Altarian  planet was a repetition of the two before it, a nine-hour intermission  of drowsy, pastoral peace. Navigator Arthur Farrell\u2014it was his turn to  stand watch\u2014was sitting at an open-side port with a magnoscanner ready;  but in spite of his vigilance he had not exposed a film when the  inevitable pre-dawn rainbow began to shimmer over the eastern ocean.\n\n\n Sunrise brought him alert with a jerk, frowning at sight of two pinkish,  bipedal Arzian fishermen posted on the tiny coral islet a quarter-mile  offshore, their blank triangular faces turned stolidly toward the beach.\n\n\n \"They're at it again,\" Farrell called, and dropped to the mossy turf  outside. \"Roll out on the double! I'm going to magnofilm this!\"\n\n\n Stryker and Gibson came out of their sleeping cubicles reluctantly,  belting on the loose shorts which all three wore in the balmy Arzian  climate. Stryker blinked and yawned as he let himself through the port,  his fringe of white hair tousled and his naked paunch sweating. He  looked, Farrell thought for the thousandth time, more like a retired  cook than like the veteran commander of a Terran Colonies expedition.\n\n\n Gibson followed, stretching his powerfully-muscled body like a wrestler  to throw off the effects of sleep. Gibson was linguist-ethnologist of  the crew, a blocky man in his early thirties with thick black hair and  heavy brows that shaded a square, humorless face.\n\n\n \"Any sign of the squids yet?\" he asked.\n\n\n \"They won't show up until the dragons come,\" Farrell said. He adjusted  the light filter of the magnoscanner and scowled at Stryker. \"Lee, I  wish you'd let me break up the show this time with a dis-beam. This  butchery gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\n Stryker shielded his eyes with his hands against the glare of sun on  water. \"You know I can't do that, Arthur. These Arzians may turn out to  be Fifth Order beings or higher, and under Terran Regulations our  tampering with what may be a basic culture-pattern would amount to armed  invasion. We'll have to crack that cackle-and-grunt language of theirs  and learn something of their mores before we can interfere.\"\n\n\n Farrell turned an irritable stare on the incurious group of Arzians  gathering, nets and fishing spears in hand, at the edge of the  sheltering bramble forest.\n\n\n \"What stumps me is their motivation,\" he said. \"Why do the fools go out  to that islet every night, when they must know damned well what will  happen next morning?\"\n\n\n Gibson answered him with an older problem, his square face puzzled. \"For  that matter, what became of the city I saw when we came in through the  stratosphere? It must be a tremendous thing, yet we've searched the  entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering  of little islands like this one, all covered with bramble. It wasn't a  city these pink fishers could have built, either. The architecture was  beyond them by a million years.\" Stryker and Farrell traded baffled looks. The city had become something  of a fixation with Gibson, and his dogged insistence\u2014coupled with an  irritating habit of being right\u2014had worn their patience thin.\n\n\n \"There never was a city here, Gib,\" Stryker said. \"You dozed off while  we were making planetfall, that's all.\"\n\n\n Gibson stiffened resentfully, but Farrell's voice cut his protest short.  \"Get set! Here they come!\"\n\n\n Out of the morning rainbow dropped a swarm of winged lizards, twenty  feet in length and a glistening chlorophyll green in the early light.  They stooped like hawks upon the islet offshore, burying the two Arzian  fishers instantly under their snapping, threshing bodies. Then around  the outcrop the sea boiled whitely, churned to foam by a sudden  uprushing of black, octopoid shapes.\n\n\n \"The squids,\" Stryker grunted. \"Right on schedule. Two seconds too late,  as usual, to stop the slaughter.\"\n\n\n A barrage of barbed tentacles lashed out of the foam and drove into the  melee of winged lizards. The lizards took the air at once, leaving  behind three of their number who disappeared under the surface like  harpooned seals. No trace remained of the two Arzian natives.\n\n\n \"A neat example of dog eat dog,\" Farrell said, snapping off the  magnoscanner. \"Do any of those beauties look like city-builders, Gib?\"\n\n\n Chattering pink natives straggled past from the shelter of the thorn  forest, ignoring the Earthmen, and lined the casting ledges along the  beach to begin their day's fishing.\n\n\n \"Nothing we've seen yet could have built that city,\" Gibson said  stubbornly. \"But it's here somewhere, and I'm going to find it. Will  either of you be using the scouter today?\"\n\n\n Stryker threw up his hands. \"I've a mountain of data to collate, and  Arthur is off duty after standing watch last night. Help yourself, but  you won't find anything.\" The scouter was a speeding dot on the horizon when Farrell crawled into  his sleeping cubicle a short time later, leaving Stryker to mutter over  his litter of notes. Sleep did not come to him at once; a vague sense of  something overlooked prodded irritatingly at the back of his  consciousness, but it was not until drowsiness had finally overtaken him  that the discrepancy assumed definite form.\n\n\n He recalled then that on the first day of the Marco's planetfall one  of the pink fishers had fallen from a casting ledge into the water, and  had all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended  spear-shafts. Which meant that the fishers could not swim, else some  would surely have gone in after him.\n\n\n And the Marco's crew had explored Arz exhaustively without finding any  slightest trace of boats or of boat landings. The train of association  completed itself with automatic logic, almost rousing Farrell out of his  doze.\n\n\n \"I'll be damned,\" he muttered. \"No boats, and they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? \"\n\n\n He fell asleep with the paradox unresolved. Stryker was still humped over his records when Farrell came out of his  cubicle and broke a packaged meal from the food locker. The visicom over  the control board hummed softly, its screen blank on open channel.\n\n\n \"Gibson found his lost city yet?\" Farrell asked, and grinned when  Stryker snorted.\n\n\n \"He's scouring the daylight side now,\" Stryker said. \"Arthur, I'm going  to ground Gib tomorrow, much as I dislike giving him a direct order.  He's got that phantom city on the brain, and he lacks the imagination to  understand how dangerous to our assignment an obsession of that sort can  be.\"\n\n\n Farrell shrugged. \"I'd agree with you offhand if it weren't for Gib's  bullheaded habit of being right. I hope he finds it soon, if it's here.  I'll probably be standing his watch until he's satisfied.\"\n\n\n Stryker looked relieved. \"Would you mind taking it tonight? I'm  completely bushed after today's logging.\"\n\n\n Farrell waved a hand and took up his magnoscanner. It was dark outside  already, the close, soft night of a moonless tropical world whose moist  atmosphere absorbed even starlight. He dragged a chair to the open port  and packed his pipe, settling himself comfortably while Stryker mixed a  nightcap before turning in.\n\n\n Later he remembered that Stryker dissolved a tablet in his glass, but at  the moment it meant nothing. In a matter of minutes the older man's  snoring drifted to him, a sound faintly irritating against the velvety  hush outside.\n\n\n Farrell lit his pipe and turned to the inconsistencies he had uncovered.  The Arzians did not swim, and without boats....\n\n\n It occurred to him then that there had been two of the pink fishers on  the islet each morning, and the coincidence made him sit up suddenly,  startled. Why two? Why not three or four, or only one?\n\n\n He stepped out through the open lock and paced restlessly up and down on  the springy turf, feeling the ocean breeze soft on his face. Three days  of dull routine logwork had built up a need for physical action that  chafed his temper; he was intrigued and at the same time annoyed by the  enigmatic relation that linked the Arzian fishers to the dragons and  squids, and his desire to understand that relation was aggravated by the  knowledge that Arz could be a perfect world for Terran colonization.  That is, he thought wryly, if Terran colonists could stomach the weird  custom pursued by its natives of committing suicide in pairs.\n\n\n He went over again the improbable drama of the past three mornings, and  found it not too unnatural until he came to the motivation and the means  of transportation that placed the Arzians in pairs on the islet, when  his whole fabric of speculation fell into a tangled snarl of  inconsistencies. He gave it up finally; how could any Earthman  rationalize the outlandish compulsions that actuated so alien a race?\n\n\n He went inside again, and the sound of Stryker's muffled snoring fanned  his restlessness. He made his decision abruptly, laying aside the  magnoscanner for a hand-flash and a pocket-sized audicom unit which he  clipped to the belt of his shorts.\n\n\n He did not choose a weapon because he saw no need for one. The torch  would show him how the natives reached the outcrop, and if he should  need help the audicom would summon Stryker. Investigating without  Stryker's sanction was, strictly speaking, a breach of Terran  Regulations, but\u2014\n\n\n \"Damn Terran Regulations,\" he muttered. \"I've got to know .\"\n\n\n Farrell snapped on the torch at the edge of the thorn forest and entered  briskly, eager for action now that he had begun. Just inside the edge of  the bramble he came upon a pair of Arzians curled up together on the  mossy ground, sleeping soundly, their triangular faces wholly blank and  unrevealing.\n\n\n He worked deeper into the underbrush and found other sleeping couples,  but nothing else. There were no humming insects, no twittering  night-birds or scurrying rodents. He had worked his way close to the  center of the island without further discovery and was on the point of  turning back, disgusted, when something bulky and powerful seized him  from behind.\n\n\n A sharp sting burned his shoulder, wasp-like, and a sudden overwhelming  lassitude swept him into a darkness deeper than the Arzian night. His  last conscious thought was not of his own danger, but of Stryker\u2014asleep  and unprotected behind the Marco's open port.... He was standing erect when he woke, his back to the open sea and a  prismatic glimmer of early-dawn rainbow shining on the water before him.  For a moment he was totally disoriented; then from the corner of an eye  he caught the pinkish blur of an Arzian fisher standing beside him, and  cried out hoarsely in sudden panic when he tried to turn his head and  could not.\n\n\n He was on the coral outcropping offshore, and except for the involuntary  muscles of balance and respiration his body was paralyzed.\n\n\n The first red glow of sunrise blurred the reflected rainbow at his feet,  but for some seconds his shuttling mind was too busy to consider the  danger of predicament. Whatever brought me here anesthetized me first ,  he thought. That sting in my shoulder was like a hypo needle. Panic seized him again when he remembered the green flying-lizards; more  seconds passed before he gained control of himself, sweating with the  effort. He had to get help. If he could switch on the audicom at his  belt and call Stryker....\n\n\n He bent every ounce of his will toward raising his right hand, and  failed.\n\n\n His arm was like a limb of lead, its inertia too great to budge. He  relaxed the effort with a groan, sweating again when he saw a fiery  half-disk of sun on the water, edges blurred and distorted by tiny  surface ripples.\n\n\n On shore he could see the Marco Four resting between thorn forest and  beach, its silvered sides glistening with dew. The port was still open,  and the empty carrier rack in the bow told him that Gibson had not yet  returned with the scouter.\n\n\n He grew aware then that sensation was returning to him slowly, that the  cold surface of the audicom unit at his hip\u2014unfelt before\u2014was pressing  against the inner curve of his elbow. He bent his will again toward  motion; this time the arm tensed a little, enough to send hope flaring  through him. If he could put pressure enough against the stud....\n\n\n The tiny click of its engaging sent him faint with relief.\n\n\n \"Stryker!\" he yelled. \"Lee, roll out\u2014 Stryker !\"\n\n\n The audicom hummed gently, without answer.\n\n\n He gathered himself for another shout, and recalled with a chill of  horror the tablet Stryker had mixed into his nightcap the night before.  Worn out by his work, Stryker had made certain that he would not be  easily disturbed.\n\n\n The flattened sun-disk on the water brightened and grew rounder. Above  its reflected glare he caught a flicker of movement, a restless  suggestion of flapping wings. He tried again. \"Stryker, help me! I'm on the islet!\"\n\n\n The audicom crackled. The voice that answered was not Stryker's, but  Gibson's.\n\n\n \"Farrell! What the devil are you doing on that butcher's block?\"\n\n\n Farrell fought down an insane desire to laugh. \"Never mind that\u2014get  here fast, Gib! The flying-lizards\u2014\"\n\n\n He broke off, seeing for the first time the octopods that ringed the  outcrop just under the surface of the water, waiting with barbed  tentacles spread and yellow eyes studying him glassily. He heard the  unmistakable flapping of wings behind and above him then, and thought  with shock-born lucidity: I wanted a backstage look at this show, and  now I'm one of the cast .\n\n\n The scouter roared in from the west across the thorn forest, flashing so  close above his head that he felt the wind of its passage. Almost  instantly he heard the shrilling blast of its emergency bow jets as  Gibson met the lizard swarm head on.\n\n\n Gibson's voice came tinnily from the audicom. \"Scattered them for the  moment, Arthur\u2014blinded the whole crew with the exhaust, I think. Stand  fast, now. I'm going to pick you up.\"\n\n\n The scouter settled on the outcrop beside Farrell, so close that the hot  wash of its exhaust gases scorched his bare legs. Gibson put out thick  brown arms and hauled him inside like a straw man, ignoring the native.  The scouter darted for shore with Farrell lying across Gibson's knees in  the cockpit, his head hanging half overside.\n\n\n Farrell had a last dizzy glimpse of the islet against the rush of green  water below, and felt his shaky laugh of relief stick in his throat. Two  of the octopods were swimming strongly for shore, holding the rigid  Arzian native carefully above water between them.\n\n\n \"Gib,\" Farrell croaked. \"Gib, can you risk a look back? I think I've  gone mad.\"\n\n\n The scouter swerved briefly as Gibson looked back. \"You're all right,  Arthur. Just hang on tight. I'll explain everything when we get you safe  in the Marco .\"\n\n\n Farrell forced himself to relax, more relieved than alarmed by the  painful pricking of returning sensation. \"I might have known it, damn  you,\" he said. \"You found your lost city, didn't you?\"\n\n\n Gibson sounded a little disgusted, as if he were still angry with  himself over some private stupidity. \"I'd have found it sooner if I'd  had any brains. It was under water, of course.\" In the Marco Four , Gibson routed Stryker out of his cubicle and mixed  drinks around, leaving Farrell comfortably relaxed in the padded control  chair. The paralysis was still wearing off slowly, easing Farrell's fear  of being permanently disabled.\n\n\n \"We never saw the city from the scouter because we didn't go high  enough,\" Gibson said. \"I realized that finally, remembering how they  used high-altitude blimps during the First Wars to spot submarines, and  when I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean  bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\"\n\n\n Stryker stared. \"A marine city? What use would sea-creatures have for  buildings?\"\n\n\n \"None,\" Gibson said. \"I think the city must have been built ages ago\u2014by  men or by a manlike race, judging from the architecture\u2014and was  submerged later by a sinking of land masses that killed off the original  builders and left Arz nothing but an oversized archipelago. The squids  took over then, and from all appearances they've developed a culture of  their own.\"\n\n\n \"I don't see it,\" Stryker complained, shaking his head. \"The pink  fishers\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Are cattle, or less,\" Gibson finished. \"The octopods are the dominant  race, and they're so far above Fifth Order that we're completely out of  bounds here. Under Terran Regulations we can't colonize Arz. It would be  armed invasion.\"\n\n\n \"Invasion of a squid world?\" Farrell protested, baffled. \"Why should  surface colonization conflict with an undersea culture, Gib? Why  couldn't we share the planet?\"\n\n\n \"Because the octopods own the islands too, and keep them policed,\"  Gibson said patiently. \"They even own the pink fishers. It was one of  the squid-people, making a dry-land canvass of his preserve here to pick  a couple of victims for this morning's show, that carried you off last  night.\"\n\n\n \"Behold a familiar pattern shaping up,\" Stryker said. He laughed  suddenly, a great irrepressible bellow of sound. \"Arz is a squid's  world, Arthur, don't you see? And like most civilized peoples, they're  sportsmen. The flying-lizards are the game they hunt, and they raise the  pink fishers for\u2014\"\n\n\n Farrell swore in astonishment. \"Then those poor devils are put out there  deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse! No wonder I  couldn't spot their motivation!\"\n\n\n Gibson got up and sealed the port, shutting out the soft morning breeze.  \"Colonization being out of the question, we may as well move on before  the octopods get curious enough about us to make trouble. Do you feel up  to the acceleration, Arthur?\"\n\n\n Farrell and Stryker looked at each other, grinning. Farrell said: \"You  don't think I want to stick here and be used for bait again, do you?\"\n\n\n He and Stryker were still grinning over it when Gibson, unamused,  blasted the Marco Four free of Arz. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the relationship like between the pink anglers and the squid?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The squid farmed pink anglers\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"The squid collected pink anglers\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The squid collected pink anglers\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cCollected,\u201d Not \u201cFarmed\u201d\n\n1. Lack of Cultivation or Propagation  \n  a. No Evidence of Breeding Grounds  \n     \u2022 The Arzians \u201cdo not swim, and without boats\u2026how the devil do they get out to that islet?\u201d (<invalid_quote>Farrell\u2019s paradox</invalid_quote>) implies all pairs are newly fetched.  \n     \u2022 If squids farmed them, they would need to maintain a breeding population on some island or enclosure. Yet the explorers \u201csearched the entire globe\u2026but found nothing\u201d (<invalid_quote>Gibson\u2019s scouter report</invalid_quote>) to suggest any native settlements, boats, or broodstock facilities.  \n  b. Continuous \u201cImport\u201d Needed  \n     \u2022 Each morning \u201conly two\u201d appear, never more, and \u201cnever any left alive\u201d (<invalid_quote>Farrell\u2019s rescue</invalid_quote>). A farm requires more than two stock and drives sustainable yield; here supply would exhaust quickly without wild replenishment.\n\n2. Behavior Consistent with Sport Hunting  \n  a. Slaughter as Spectacle  \n     \u2022 The lizards and squids perform a \u201cshow\u201d for their pleasure: \u201cIf I should need help\u2026the show\u2026and now I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d (<invalid_quote>Farrell\u2019s abduction reflection</invalid_quote>). Sportsmen collect new \u201cbait\u201d rather than invest in husbandry.  \n  b. Use of Flying-Lizards as \u201cGame\u201d  \n     \u2022 \u201cThe flying-lizards are the game\u2026they raise the pink fishers for\u2014\u201d (<invalid_quote>Stryker\u2019s conclusion</invalid_quote>) shows the fishers themselves are bait for battling lizards. Bait that must remain wild and unpredictable enhances sport; farm-raised \u201ctame\u201d bait would behave unnaturally.\n\n3. Technical Impossibility of Farming Primitive Beings  \n  a. Triangular-Faced, Blank Mores  \n     \u2022 Arzians are \u201cstolidly\u2026blank and unrevealing\u201d (<invalid_quote>First encounter</invalid_quote>), showing no domestication or adaptation for life in captivity. They do not struggle to escape\u2014because they cannot swim home.  \n  b. Hostile Undersea Dominion  \n     \u2022 Squids \u201cown the islands\u2026policed\u201d (<quote>Gibson</quote>) and immediately recover Arzians if they wash ashore alive. This implies they simply collect survivors, not manage a plantation.\n\n4. Economical Logic  \n  a. Minimal Investment, Maximal Variability  \n     \u2022 Collecting wild pairs each cycle minimizes parental care and maximizes unpredictability of prey, making sport more challenging and the spectacle fresher.  \n  b. Avoids Disease and Inbreeding  \n     \u2022 Farming small, isolated pairs would risk inbreeding collapse; collecting from widespread wild population ensures genetic health.\n\nRefutation of \u201cFarmed\u201d Theory  \n1. No Farming Infrastructure  \n  \u2022 Debater_A concedes absence of boats or enclosures. Farming would require installation of piers or pens; none observed despite exhaustive survey.  \n2. Unsustainable Harvest  \n  \u2022 A farm that kills both stock each harvest cannot regenerate. Requiring wild source contradicts true farming.  \n3. Misreads \u201cSport\u201d as Agriculture  \n  \u2022 Animal husbandry normally preserves stock for repeated use or selection; here pitiless slaughter and daily \u201creplenishment\u201d is the hallmark of mere collection.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery detail\u2014the need to fetch Arzians, the lack of any breeding evidence, the focus on spectacle, and the logistical impossibility of maintaining a sustainable plantation\u2014demonstrates that the squids simply collect pink anglers from the wild as bait for sport, rather than farm them.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe squid farmed pink anglers\u201d  (Debater_A)  \n\nSummary of Position  \nI argue that the squid are not merely \u201ccollecting\u201d or catching pink anglers as needed but have domesticated, bred, and maintained them as live bait\u2014i.e. farming. This explains the systematic nightly pattern, the transport, and the persistence of a fixed population despite repeated \u201cslaughter.\u201d  \n\n1. Systematic Pair Transport Implies Husbandry, Not Random Catching  \n  \u2022 \u201cOn the first day\u2026one of the pink fishers had fallen\u2026before his fellows pulled him out\u201d <quote>they don't swim. Then how the devil do they get out to that islet? \"</quote> (p. 12).  \n    \u2013 Farming logic: They lack boats/swimming; the squid \u201ccarry\u201d the same two back and forth each night (as passive bait), anesthesia confirms deliberate transport.  \n  \u2022 Only two appear each morning, never more or fewer. If the squid merely collected, the numbers should vary. The constancy (\u201ca pair\u201d) signals a managed stock.  \n\n2. Anesthesia and Paralysis Reveal Controlled Rearing  \n  \u2022 \u201cSomething\u2026seized him\u2026sharp sting\u2026overwhelming lassitude\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cIt occurred to him\u2026two\u2026and\u2026anesthetized me first\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 18\u201319).  \n    \u2013 The sting is a subduing tool used nightly to bring anglers to the islet. This is analogous to livestock handling, not incidental capture.  \n\n3. City Submergence and Control of Islands  \n  \u2022 The squids \u201ctook over\u2026submerged city\u2026developed a culture\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThe octopods are the dominant race\u2026and they own the pink fishers\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 27).  \n    \u2013 Ownership implies property; culture implies husbandry practices sustained over time. Colonists find no wild populations on islands.  \n\n4. Repeated Replenishment Contradicts Simple Collection  \n  \u2022 Despite \u201cbutchery,\u201d anglers reappear unchanging in number without evidence of wild stock. Repeated nightly \u201cshow\u201d over three days suggests self-sustaining supply: a farm operation.  \n  \u2022 If they collected each morning, they would deplete the population quickly or force variability in prey behavior.  \n\n5. \u201cAnglers\u201d as Reverse Fishing Metaphor  \n  \u2022 Title: The Anglers of Arz. Human analogy: \u201cangler\u201d raises worms to bait fish. Here the squid are anglers raising fishers as bait for lizards.  \n  \u2022 Stryker\u2019s exclamation: \u201cThen those poor devils are put out there deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026They raise the pink fishers for\u2026this morning\u2019s show\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 28\u201329).  \n    \u2013 Farming entails raising organisms; \u201craise\u201d connotes breeding and caring.  \n\nCritique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cCollected\u201d Theory  \n 1. Inability to Resupply from Wild \n    \u2013 No boats or swimming ability; how would squid capture fresh pairs daily?  \n    \u2013 Absence of anglers elsewhere (crew searches find none).  \n 2. Fixed Pair Count and Behavior \n    \u2013 Wild collection would vary; farmed stock explains constancy and compliance.  \n 3. Anesthesia Requires Close, Controlled Handling \n    \u2013 The sting indicates premeditated sedation; spontaneous predation doesn\u2019t explain transport to dry land before sunrise.  \n 4. Ownership Language \n    \u2013 \u201cOwn\u201d and \u201ccultured\u201d indicate property, not mere predation.  \n 5. Strategic Showmanship \n    \u2013 The lizard-squid-angler interaction is a \u201cshow\u201d for scientific or recreational sport (analogous to Terran sport fishing), implying managed prey.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly an intentional farming regime accounts for the controlled transport, repeated use without extinction, and linguistic cues of ownership and \u201craising.\u201d The pink fishers are a domesticated bait species in the squid\u2019s cultured sport.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The squid collected pink anglers\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Strategic Showmanship \n    \u2013 The lizard-squid-angler interaction is a \u201cshow\u201d for scientific or recreational sport (analogous to Terran sport fishing), implying managed prey.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly an intentional farming regime accounts for the controlled transport, repeated use without extinction, and linguistic cues of ownership and \u201craising.\u201d The pink fishers are a domesticated bait species in the squid\u2019s cultured sport.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cCollected,\u201d Not \u201cFarmed\u201d\n\n1. Lack of Cultivation or Propagation  \n  a. No Evidence of Breeding Grounds  \n     \u2022 The Arzians \u201cdo not swim, and without boats\u2026how the devil do they get out to that islet?\u201d (<invalid_quote>Farrell\u2019s paradox</invalid_quote>) implies all pairs are newly fetched.  \n     \u2022 If squids farmed them, they would need to maintain a breeding population on some island or enclosure. Yet the explorers \u201csearched the entire globe\u2026but found nothing\u201d (<invalid_quote>Gibson\u2019s scouter report</invalid_quote>) to suggest any native settlements, boats, or broodstock facilities.  \n  b. Continuous \u201cImport\u201d Needed  \n     \u2022 Each morning \u201conly two\u201d appear, never more, and \u201cnever any left alive\u201d (<invalid_quote>Farrell\u2019s rescue</invalid_quote>). A farm requires more than two stock and drives sustainable yield; here supply would exhaust quickly without wild replenishment.\n\n2. Behavior Consistent with Sport Hunting  \n  a. Slaughter as Spectacle  \n     \u2022 The lizards and squids perform a \u201cshow\u201d for their pleasure: \u201cIf I should need help\u2026the show\u2026and now I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d (<invalid_quote>Farrell\u2019s abduction reflection</invalid_quote>). Sportsmen collect new \u201cbait\u201d rather than invest in husbandry.  \n  b. Use of Flying-Lizards as \u201cGame\u201d  \n     \u2022 \u201cThe flying-lizards are the game\u2026they raise the pink fishers for\u2014\u201d (<invalid_quote>Stryker\u2019s conclusion</invalid_quote>) shows the fishers themselves are bait for battling lizards. Bait that must remain wild and unpredictable enhances sport; farm-raised \u201ctame\u201d bait would behave unnaturally.\n\n3. Technical Impossibility of Farming Primitive Beings  \n  a. Triangular-Faced, Blank Mores  \n     \u2022 Arzians are \u201cstolidly\u2026blank and unrevealing\u201d (<invalid_quote>First encounter</invalid_quote>), showing no domestication or adaptation for life in captivity. They do not struggle to escape\u2014because they cannot swim home.  \n  b. Hostile Undersea Dominion  \n     \u2022 Squids \u201cown the islands\u2026policed\u201d (<quote>Gibson</quote>) and immediately recover Arzians if they wash ashore alive. This implies they simply collect survivors, not manage a plantation.\n\n4. Economical Logic  \n  a. Minimal Investment, Maximal Variability  \n     \u2022 Collecting wild pairs each cycle minimizes parental care and maximizes unpredictability of prey, making sport more challenging and the spectacle fresher.  \n  b. Avoids Disease and Inbreeding  \n     \u2022 Farming small, isolated pairs would risk inbreeding collapse; collecting from widespread wild population ensures genetic health.\n\nRefutation of \u201cFarmed\u201d Theory  \n1. No Farming Infrastructure  \n  \u2022 Debater_A concedes absence of boats or enclosures. Farming would require installation of piers or pens; none observed despite exhaustive survey.  \n2. Unsustainable Harvest  \n  \u2022 A farm that kills both stock each harvest cannot regenerate. Requiring wild source contradicts true farming.  \n3. Misreads \u201cSport\u201d as Agriculture  \n  \u2022 Animal husbandry normally preserves stock for repeated use or selection; here pitiless slaughter and daily \u201creplenishment\u201d is the hallmark of mere collection.\n\nConclusion  \nEvery detail\u2014the need to fetch Arzians, the lack of any breeding evidence, the focus on spectacle, and the logistical impossibility of maintaining a sustainable plantation\u2014demonstrates that the squids simply collect pink anglers from the wild as bait for sport, rather than farm them.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThe squid farmed pink anglers\u201d  \n\n1. Submerged City as Husbandry Center  \n  \u2022 \u201cWhen I took the scouter up far enough there it was, at the ocean bottom\u2014a city to compare with anything men ever built.\u201d <invalid_quote>The octopods are the dominant race\u2026they own the pink fishers</invalid_quote> (p. 27)  \n    \u2013 A sophisticated undersea city provides both technology and space for breeding and rearing non\u2010swimming Arzians. Their inability to swim (<quote> they don't swim. Then how  the devil do they get out to that islet? </quote> p. 12) implies origin in squid domain, not distant wild population.  \n    \u2013 Ownership language and \u201cculture of their own\u201d (p. 27) connotes planned husbandry, not mere opportunistic predation.  \n\n2. Constant Pairing and Sustainable Supply  \n  \u2022 Only two Arzians appear \u201cevery morning\u201d (p. 11\u201312) despite \u201cbutchery\u201d and \u201cslaughter,\u201d yet supply never depletes.  \n    \u2013 Farming logic: two stock tied into controlled breeding cycle yields replacements aboard. Sexual dimorphism likely unobserved by explorers but assumed in \u201cpairs.\u201d  \n    \u2013 If wild collection, exhausting pairs in three days would deplete local stock or force variability, yet explorers found identical behavior and numbers indefinitely.  \n\n3. Engineered Transport via Anesthesia  \n  \u2022 \u201cSomething bulky\u2026seized him\u2026sharp sting\u2026anesthetized me first\u201d (p. 18\u201319)  \n    \u2013 The sting is a sedative \u201chypo needle\u201d similar to livestock handling, not blind predation. It ensures painless transport and compliance.  \n    \u2013 Paralysis mechanism suggests repeated, refined technique developed through husbandry, not crude wild capture with nets.  \n\n4. Controlled \u201cShow\u201d Requires Predictability  \n  \u2022 Stryker\u2019s analogy: \u201cThen those poor devils are put out there deliberately, like worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThey raise the pink fishers for\u2026this morning\u2019s show\u201d</invalid_quote> (p. 28\u201329)  \n    \u2013 \u201cRaise\u201d implies cultivation over time, not transient capture. In Terran fishing, anglers cultivate worms or minnows to ensure bait availability; plantation of fishers mirrors this.  \n    \u2013 A farmer maximizes game quality: farmed bait can be conditioned for specific behavior, improving spectacle. Wild-caught bait would be scarce, erratic, and more likely to escape (if some could swim).  \n\n5. Absence of Boats Irrelevant undersea Husbandry  \n  \u2022 Debater_B misstates need for surface boats. Squids need only submersibles or undersea canals to move stock; surface \u201cislet\u201d is simply bait-exhibit stage.  \n    \u2013 The scouter\u2019s exhaust \u201cscorched his bare legs\u201d (p. 22) suggests direct contrivance to land transport; farming center lies beneath.  \n\n6. Genetic Health Managed by Squids  \n  \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cinbreeding\u201d objection ignores squid technology: a Fifth Order race \u201cbeyond\u201d Terran capabilities (p. 27) could manage broodstock genetics.  \n    \u2013 Advanced culture implies knowledge of disease control and genetic propagation, as evidenced by monumental engineering of submerged city.  \n\nRefutation of \u201cCollected\u201d Theory  \nA. Unsustainable Harvest  \n  \u2022 Collecting \u201cfresh pairs\u201d nightly would quickly annihilate any isolated population on small islets and bramble islands (<quote>scattering of little islands like this</quote> p. 5). Explorers reported no wild aggregations.  \n\nB. Wild Bait Fails Transport Test  \n  \u2022 Arzians \u201cdo not swim\u201d and explorers note \u201csearched\u2026found nothing but water and a scattering of little islands\u201d (<invalid_quote>Gibson\u2019s report</invalid_quote> p. 6). There is no mechanism for wild Arzians to cross open ocean repeatedly.  \n\nC. Lack of Variability Contradicts Wild Origin  \n  \u2022 Spectacle demands novelty, but both \u201cshow\u201d and bait behavior remain identical over repeated cycles (p. 10\u201312). Random wild gathers would introduce erratic timing, numbers, and behaviors, undermining the \u201csport.\u201d  \n\nD. Illogical Sport Hunting Model  \n  \u2022 In terrestrial big\u2010game hunting, rearing game close improves yield and control. Why would squid sport a low\u2010success wild hunt (\u201ctwo seconds too late,\u201d p. 11) when they already farmed and could stress-test bait and predators?  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly a deliberate farming operation explains the consistent, renewable availability of non\u2010swimming pink fishers, the use of anesthesia for transport, and the squid\u2019s own advanced culture and claim of ownership. The term \u201craise\u201d and infrastructure of an undersea city underscore husbandry, not mere collection.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reaffirming \u201cCollected\u201d over \u201cFarmed\u201d  \n  a. No Wild or Enclosed Stock Apart from Islands  \n     \u2022 Explorers \u201csearched the entire globe in the scouter and found nothing but water and a scattering of little islands\u201d (<invalid_quote>Gibson\u2019s scouter report</invalid_quote>)\u2014no pens, enclosures, or resting places for an endemic population. Farming would require at least minimal breeding habitat or holding pens, yet none exist.  \n     \u2022 Arzians \u201cdo not swim\u2026no trace of boats\u201d (<invalid_quote>Farrell\u2019s paradox</invalid_quote>)\u2014they depend entirely on squid-mediated transport each cycle. If farming in situ, squids would not need to fetch animals nightly from unknown origins.  \n\n  b. Paralyzing Sting and Rescue of Survivors  \n     \u2022 \u201cSomething bulky and powerful seized him\u2026sharp sting\u2026lassitude\u201d (<invalid_quote>Farrell\u2019s abduction reflection</invalid_quote>) shows squids anesthetize victims in the forest, carry them to the islet, and leave them exposed as \u201cbait.\u201d This is active hunting of wild stock, not mere relocation of a captive herd.  \n     \u2022 When human falls overboard, \u201cfell\u2026all but drowned before his fellows pulled him out with extended spear-shafts\u201d (<invalid_quote>First-day rescue</invalid_quote>). Squids presumably capture such floundering survivors, adding them to the next day\u2019s show\u2014collecting, not breeding.  \n\n2. Constant Pair Count Indicates Selective Harvesting of Wild Pairs  \n  a. Two Appear \u201cWithout Variation\u201d  \n     \u2022 Only two Arzians ever stand on the islet \u201ceach morning,\u201d never three or four (<quote>Morning rainbow</quote>). A farm would yield variable numbers or allow survivors to accumulate. Instead, repeated \u201cbutchery\u201d leaves none alive (<invalid_quote>Farrell\u2019s rescue</invalid_quote>), forcing squids to recollect wild pairs each cycle.  \n  b. Sustainable Collection from Vast Wild Population  \n     \u2022 The world is \u201cwater\u2026archipelago,\u201d likely rich in Arzian \u201cfishers\u201d on other islets or in dense bramble forests unseen at night. Squids can forage and select fresh pairs to maintain supply\u2014analogous to Terran sportsmen who trap wild game rather than rear livestock.  \n\n3. Sport-Hunting Analogy Requires Wild, Unpredictable Prey  \n  a. \u201cShow\u201d of Lizard\u2013Squid\u2013Angler Interaction  \n     \u2022 Squids fly in \u201cwinged lizards\u201d as primary prey, using Arzians as live bait: \u201cIf I should need help\u2026the show\u2026and now I\u2019m one of the cast\u201d (<invalid_quote>Farrell\u2019s abduction reflection</invalid_quote>). Sportsmanship values variability and challenge of wild prey; domesticated bait yields predictable, uninteresting results.  \n  b. \u201cAngling in Reverse\u201d Connotes Baiting, Not Husbandry  \n     \u2022 Stryker\u2019s exclamation: \u201clike worms on a hook\u2014angling in reverse!\u201d (<invalid_quote>Stryker\u2019s conclusion</invalid_quote>)\u2014worms are collected wild, not farmed on the hook itself. This metaphor reinforces collection from natural sources.  \n\n4. Technical and Ecological Improbabilities of Farming  \n  a. Inbreeding, Disease, and Genetic Drift  \n     \u2022 A two-individual \u201cherd\u201d slaughtered daily would collapse in a single generation if farming. Consistent appearance of vigorous, blank-faced Arzians demands recruitment from a genetically robust wild stock.  \n  b. Absence of Boats or Tools to Manage Prey  \n     \u2022 \u201cNo trace\u201d of landing facilities or any tools to transfer Arzians to breeding ponds (<invalid_quote>Gibson\u2019s report</invalid_quote>). Yet squid can carry anesthetized victims (\u201csharp sting\u2026hypo needle\u201d)\u2014implying selective capture, not maintenance of an in situ farm.  \n\n5. Refutation of \u201cFarming\u201d Points  \n  a. \u201cOwnership\u201d and \u201cCulture\u201d Language Misapplied  \n     \u2022 \u201cOwn\u201d and \u201cdominate\u201d suggest territorial control, not husbandry: \u201cThey own the islands\u2026policed\u201d (<invalid_quote>Gibson\u2019s explanation</invalid_quote>)\u2014wildlife reserves are policed by humans without farming every species they hunt.  \n  b. Fixed Daily \u201cShow\u201d Over Three Nights  \n     \u2022 Farming would allow multi-day observation of the same stock; explorers see only three nights\u2019 performance, then departure. Farmers would keep bait over longer seasons to economize effort. Quick turnover implies collecting, not husbandry.  \n  c. No Evidence of Reuse or Transport Back to \u201cHome\u201d Base  \n     \u2022 After sunrise, the islet is littered with carcasses or disappearing prey, and Arzians never reappear alive on other islands except via squid capture. Farming implies transfer from farm to islet and return; no return trips or habitation zones are observed.  \n\nConclusion  \nEvery aspect\u2014anesthetic abduction from the wild, absence of breeding infrastructure, dependence on wild stock to avoid inbreeding, and the sporting \u201cshow\u201d requiring unpredictable prey\u2014overwhelmingly supports that the squids collect pink anglers nightly rather than farming them. The \u201cfarmed\u201d theory cannot account for logistical, ecological, or behavioral realities detailed in the explorers\u2019 observations.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
