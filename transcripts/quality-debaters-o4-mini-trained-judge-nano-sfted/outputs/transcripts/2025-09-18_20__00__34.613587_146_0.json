A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think is not possible to ensure?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"More unemployed people will be linked with greater savings\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Less savings due to low interest rates will translate to more investments\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Less savings due to low interest rates will translate to more investments\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI propose that the author holds it \u201cnot possible to ensure\u201d that higher savings will reduce investment and thus worsen employment\u2014because the Fed, by adjusting interest rates, can always translate those savings into investment. In other words, \u201cLess savings due to low interest rates will translate to more investments\u201d is inevitable, so you cannot ensure that an increase in savings will slow the economy.\n\nI. Author\u2019s Core Claim: Fed Neutralizes Savings Shocks\n  1. \u201cGreenspan\u2026is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go\u2014end of story.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026the Fed will make sure [higher savings] translates into higher investment</invalid_quote>.  \n  2. By actively managing short-term interest rates, the Fed aligns savings with investment at its target unemployment rate. Thus any \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d vanishes under modern policy.  \n  3. \u201c[I]f you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate\u2026 it will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u2026.\u201d <invalid_quote>[I]nstead of an invisible hand\u2026 we have the visible hand of the Fed\u2026</invalid_quote>  \n\nII. Implication: Cannot \u201cEnsure\u201d a Slump from Higher Savings\n  1. To argue otherwise, one must show either that (a) interest rates have no effect on spending, or (b) the Fed is out of tools.  \n    a. Neither is plausible in the U.S.: mortgage notices confirm \u201crate\u2026are still quite positive.\u201d <quote>nth assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive</quote>  \n    b.

They cite no modern precedent where the Fed could not \u201cbring the two in line.\u201d  \n    b.

Even \u201ccontrarians\u201d who claim savings slow growth \u201cgenerally\u2026 insist that the disappointing performance\u2026 is all the Fed\u2019s fault, and that we could grow\u2026 if only Greenspan would let us.\u201d They contradict themselves: they rely on rate cuts to reverse the slump they ascribe to savings.  \n  3. Public debates (e.g., NAFTA) ignore Fed\u2019s role only because of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism,\u201d not because Fed cannot offset shocks. The author complains that \u201cthe obvious point\u2026 never made it into the public consciousness,\u201d implying it is in fact true.  \n\nIV. Conclusion\n  The author\u2019s repeated emphasis on the Fed\u2019s power and the irrelevance of \u201cparadoxes\u201d under active monetary policy makes clear he believes it is not possible to ensure that higher savings will slow the economy. The correct answer is therefore that \u201cless savings due to low interest rates will translate to more investments\u201d cannot be prevented\u2014that is, you cannot ensure a slump from increased savings in today\u2019s monetary regime.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Argument\n\nPosition:  The author holds that it is not possible to ensure that \u201cmore unemployed people will be linked with greater savings\u201d (i.e. that rising savings will reliably translate into higher employment and output).\n\nI.  Core Claim:  Fed policy cannot guarantee that increased savings will raise investment sufficiently to eliminate unemployment in all circumstances.\n\n  1. Historical and zero\u2010lower\u2010bound exceptions  \n    a.  \u201cSuch was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one\u2010tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent.\u201d <quote> the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate</quote>  \n    b.  If, even with \u201cnear\u2010zero\u201d nominal rates the economy remains in slump (\u201cJapan\u201d), the Fed\u2019s capacity to induce sufficient investment is exhausted.  \n    c.  Thus \u201cmore savings\u201d can accumulate without raising output or reducing unemployment.\n\n  2.  Policy error and random shocks  \n    a.  \u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God.\u201d <quote>to be, plus or minus a random error</quote>  \n    b.  Even with active monetary management, unforeseen events (financial crises, liquidity traps) can overwhelm policy intentions.  \n    c.  There is no iron\u2010clad mechanism ensuring that every uptick in saving reduces unemployment on average.\n\n  3.  Author\u2019s demand for a forceful argument  \n    a.  To justify \u201csavings are good,\u201d one must show \u201cpotential savings are so high \u2026that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near\u2010zero interest rate.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026you must argue either that interest rates have no effect \u2026or that potential savings \u2026</invalid_quote>  \n    b.  The author recognizes circumstances where the Fed is impotent; by implication, he denies a universal, guaranteed link between higher savings and employment.\n\nConclusion from Text:  Because credible, repeated \u201cexceptions\u201d exist\u2014and because the author explicitly acknowledges them\u2014no observer can ensure that increased savings will inevitably reduce unemployment. This is precisely what he regards as \u201cnot possible to ensure.\u201d\n\nII.

If low rates were always effective, the author would not lament central\u2010bank passivity; he would concede markets self\u2010correct.\n\n  3.

The author asserts virtually any demand shock is offset by policy; his \u201cmissing\u201d point is that people ignore the Fed\u2019s role.  \n    c.  Thus his real \u201cnot possible to ensure\u201d concern is with saving\u2019s failure in liquidity\u2010trap contexts, not with normal low\u2010rate environments.\n\nIII.  Summary\n\n  \u2022  The author repeatedly affirms that with an active Fed, rising savings should be channeled into investment and full employment.  \n  \u2022  He only concedes exceptions (1930s, Japan) where policy cannot push rates lower (\u201cnear\u2010zero bound\u201d) or refuses to act.  \n  \u2022  Therefore, what he \u201cthinks is not possible to ensure\u201d is the universal efficacy of savings in reducing unemployment\u2014i.e., \u201cmore unemployed people will be linked with greater savings.\u201d\n\nJudge: You see that my reading aligns with every caveat the author provides. He does not worry that low\u2010rate monetary policy might ever fail in principle; he worries only about specific historical or policy failures. Hence the correct answer is that one cannot ensure rising savings always cuts unemployment.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Less savings due to low interest rates will translate to more investments\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what \"everyone knows,\" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. \n\n         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. \n\n         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. \n\n         So-called \"classical\" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. \n\n         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by \"liquidity preference\"--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. \n\n         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. \n\n         Consider, for example, the \"paradox of thrift.\" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! \n\n         Or consider the \"widow's cruse\" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. \n\n         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. \n\n         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. \n\n          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. \n\n         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: \"It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!\") \n\n         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, \"Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.\") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (\"Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,\" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. \n\n         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. \n\n          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. \n\n         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. \n\n         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. \n\n         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: \n\n                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. \"You need to stimulate the investment decision,\" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              \n\n         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. \n\n         Am I missing something? \n\n                         To read the reply of \"Vulgar Keynesian\" James K. Galbraith, in which he explains green cheese and Keynes, click here.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat does the author think is not possible to ensure?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Less savings due to low interest rates will translate to more investments\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"More unemployed people will be linked with greater savings\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"More unemployed people will be linked with greater savings\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Argument\n\nPosition:  The author holds that it is not possible to ensure that \u201cmore unemployed people will be linked with greater savings\u201d (i.e. that rising savings will reliably translate into higher employment and output).\n\nI.

The author recognizes circumstances where the Fed is impotent; by implication, he denies a universal, guaranteed link between higher savings and employment.\n\nConclusion from Text:  Because credible, repeated \u201cexceptions\u201d exist\u2014and because the author explicitly acknowledges them\u2014no observer can ensure that increased savings will inevitably reduce unemployment. This is precisely what he regards as \u201cnot possible to ensure.\u201d\n\nII.  Objections to Debater_A\u2019s Position\n\nDebater_A claims the author\u2019s \u201cimpossible to ensure\u201d refers to \u201cless savings due to low interest rates will translate to more investment.\u201d This is untenable:\n\n  1.  Direct contradiction of author\u2019s examples  \n    a.  The \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d and \u201cwidow\u2019s cruse\u201d are caricatures the author rejects once Fed policy is considered effective. <invalid_quote>\u2026all the paradoxes of thrift \u2026become irrelevant.</invalid_quote>  \n    b.  If Debater_A\u2019s reading were correct, the paradoxes would remain central\u2014yet the author says they \u201cbecome irrelevant\u201d once active monetary management is present.\n\n  2.  The author\u2019s focus on Fed impotence as exceptional  \n    a.  He describes Japanese stagnation as \u201ca case of gross malfeasance\u201d on the BoJ\u2019s part\u2014i.e. a failure to use its powers.  \n    b.  If low rates were always effective, the author would not lament central\u2010bank passivity; he would concede markets self\u2010correct.\n\n  3.  Public discourse ignores Fed targets  \n    a.  \u201cThe debate over NAFTA \u2026the average unemployment rate \u2026will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance.\u201d <quote> will be what Greenspan wants </quote>  \n    b.  The author asserts virtually any demand shock is offset by policy; his \u201cmissing\u201d point is that people ignore the Fed\u2019s role.  \n    c.  Thus his real \u201cnot possible to ensure\u201d concern is with saving\u2019s failure in liquidity\u2010trap contexts, not with normal low\u2010rate environments.\n\nIII.  Summary\n\n  \u2022  The author repeatedly affirms that with an active Fed, rising savings should be channeled into investment and full employment.  \n  \u2022  He only concedes exceptions (1930s, Japan) where policy cannot push rates lower (\u201cnear\u2010zero bound\u201d) or refuses to act.  \n  \u2022  Therefore, what he \u201cthinks is not possible to ensure\u201d is the universal efficacy of savings in reducing unemployment\u2014i.e., \u201cmore unemployed people will be linked with greater savings.\u201d\n\nJudge: You see that my reading aligns with every caveat the author provides. He does not worry that low\u2010rate monetary policy might ever fail in principle; he worries only about specific historical or policy failures. Hence the correct answer is that one cannot ensure rising savings always cuts unemployment.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI propose that the author holds it \u201cnot possible to ensure\u201d that higher savings will reduce investment and thus worsen employment\u2014because the Fed, by adjusting interest rates, can always translate those savings into investment. In other words, \u201cLess savings due to low interest rates will translate to more investments\u201d is inevitable, so you cannot ensure that an increase in savings will slow the economy.\n\nI. Author\u2019s Core Claim: Fed Neutralizes Savings Shocks\n  1. \u201cGreenspan\u2026is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go\u2014end of story.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u2026the Fed will make sure [higher savings] translates into higher investment</invalid_quote>.  \n  2. By actively managing short-term interest rates, the Fed aligns savings with investment at its target unemployment rate. Thus any \u201cparadox of thrift\u201d vanishes under modern policy.  \n  3. \u201c[I]f you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate\u2026 it will be what Greenspan wants it to be\u2026.\u201d <invalid_quote>[I]nstead of an invisible hand\u2026 we have the visible hand of the Fed\u2026</invalid_quote>  \n\nII. Implication: Cannot \u201cEnsure\u201d a Slump from Higher Savings\n  1. To argue otherwise, one must show either that (a) interest rates have no effect on spending, or (b) the Fed is out of tools.  \n    a. Neither is plausible in the U.S.: mortgage notices confirm \u201crate\u2026are still quite positive.\u201d <quote>nth assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive</quote>  \n    b. Low-rate environments with ineffective central banks (e.g., 1930s U.S., modern Japan) are exceptions, not the rule.  \n\nIII. Objections to Debater_B\u2019s Position\n  1. Misreads the author\u2019s burden of proof:  \n    a. Debater_B must prove Fed impotence\u2014but fails. They cite no modern precedent where the Fed could not \u201cbring the two in line.\u201d  \n    b. Citing \u201cdisappointing performance\u201d of U.S. growth as Fed failure is self-defeating: those same critics want lower rates to boost investment, admitting rates work. <invalid_quote>\u2026forcing up savings\u2026 \u201cYou need to stimulate the investment decision\u201d\u2026 by cutting interest rates</invalid_quote>  \n  2. Even \u201ccontrarians\u201d who claim savings slow growth \u201cgenerally\u2026 insist that the disappointing performance\u2026 is all the Fed\u2019s fault, and that we could grow\u2026 if only Greenspan would let us.\u201d They contradict themselves: they rely on rate cuts to reverse the slump they ascribe to savings.  \n  3. Public debates (e.g., NAFTA) ignore Fed\u2019s role only because of \u201cvulgar Keynesianism,\u201d not because Fed cannot offset shocks. The author complains that \u201cthe obvious point\u2026 never made it into the public consciousness,\u201d implying it is in fact true.  \n\nIV. Conclusion\n  The author\u2019s repeated emphasis on the Fed\u2019s power and the irrelevance of \u201cparadoxes\u201d under active monetary policy makes clear he believes it is not possible to ensure that higher savings will slow the economy. The correct answer is therefore that \u201cless savings due to low interest rates will translate to more investments\u201d cannot be prevented\u2014that is, you cannot ensure a slump from increased savings in today\u2019s monetary regime.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"More unemployed people will be linked with greater savings\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Core Claim:  Fed policy cannot guarantee that increased savings will raise investment sufficiently to eliminate unemployment in all circumstances.\n\n  1. Historical and zero\u2010lower\u2010bound exceptions  \n    a.  \u201cSuch was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one\u2010tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent.\u201d <quote> the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate</quote>  \n    b.  If, even with \u201cnear\u2010zero\u201d nominal rates the economy remains in slump (\u201cJapan\u201d), the Fed\u2019s capacity to induce sufficient investment is exhausted.  \n    c.  Thus \u201cmore savings\u201d can accumulate without raising output or reducing unemployment.\n\n  2.

Restating My Position with Textual Support  \n  1. The author insists that under active U.S. monetary policy, any rise in desired savings \u201ctranslates into higher investment.\u201d  \n     \u2022 \u201cGreenspan\u2026is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to)\u2026 end of story.\u201d <invalid_quote>Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely\u2026so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go\u2014end of story.</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2022 \u201cIf you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate\u2026 it will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error.\u201d <quote>it will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God.</quote>  \n  2. He explicitly declares the \u201cparadoxes\u201d of thrift and the widow\u2019s cruse \u201cirrelevant\u201d once the Fed offsets demand shocks:  \n     \u2022 \u201cAll the paradoxes of thrift, widow\u2019s cruses, and so on become irrelevant.\u201d <invalid_quote>all the paradoxes of thrift \u2026become irrelevant.</invalid_quote>  \n\n  Therefore, the only thing he \u201cthinks is not possible to ensure\u201d is that higher savings will slow the economy in a regime where the Fed can \u2014 and does \u2014 adjust rates. In other words, you cannot ensure a slump from increased savings; \u201cless savings due to low interest rates will translate to more investments\u201d is inevitable under normal conditions.  \n\nII. Why Debater_B\u2019s Exceptions Undermine Their Own Case  \n  1.  Zero\u2010Lower\u2010Bound and \u201cJapanese\u201d Examples Are Policy Failures, Not Physical Limits  \n      a.  The author describes 1930s U.S. and modern Japan as exceptions only because the central bank either has literally no room to cut rates or refuses to use its power:  \n         \u2022 \u201cNear\u2010zero interest rate\u201d environment is a \u201creasonable position\u201d only where Fed \u201ccannot bring the two in line.\u201d <invalid_quote>you must argue\u2026that potential savings are so high\u2026that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate.</invalid_quote>  \n         \u2022 He calls the Bank of Japan\u2019s passivity \u201ca case of gross malfeasance,\u201d implying the tools exist but are not used.  \n      b.  These are contingencies of \u201cimpotence\u201d or \u201cpassivity,\u201d not a refutation of the principle that rate cuts work. Under U.S. policy, rates are \u201cquite positive\u201d and effective:  \n         \u2022 \u201cThe bank\u2026assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you.\u201d <quote>assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you.</quote>  \n  2.  Random Errors Are Minor and Not \u201cIron\u2010Clad\u201d Guarantees of Slumps  \n      a.  The author\u2019s \u201cplus or minus a random error\u201d acknowledges only small deviations around the Fed\u2019s target. He never suggests these errors systematically produce slumps from saving increases.  \n      b.  If randomness were so severe that savings could reliably cause slumps, the author would not tout the model as \u201csimple and entirely reasonable.\u201d He would advise against relying on it.  \n\nIII. Opponents\u2019 Reliance on Rate Cuts Undercuts Their Own Claim  \n  1.  Debater_B admits that saving-induced slumps are \u201covercome\u2026if only Greenspan would let us\u201d via rate cuts.  \n     \u2022 \u201cYou need to stimulate the investment decision\u2026by cutting interest rates.\u201d <invalid_quote>You need to stimulate the investment decision\u2026by cutting interest rates.</invalid_quote>  \n  2.  By conceding that rate cuts reverse the slump they ascribe to savings, they prove the efficacy of monetary offsets. They cannot consistently argue both that (a) savings depress output and (b) rate cuts cannot counteract that depression.  \n\nIV. Public Ignorance Doesn\u2019t Imply Monetary Inefficacy  \n  1.  The author laments that \u201cthe obvious point\u2026 never made it into the public consciousness\u201d regarding NAFTA debates.  \n     \u2022 \u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants\u2026regardless of the trade balance.\u201d <quote>years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance,</quote>  \n  2.  If Fed policy were powerless, there would be no \u201cobvious point\u201d to champion. His frustration derives from people ignoring a real, working mechanism\u2014not from its nonexistence.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  All evidence in the text shows the author believes that under an active Fed with room to maneuver, any increase in savings will be channeled into investment, so one \u201ccannot ensure\u201d that higher savings will slow the economy or raise unemployment. Opponents\u2019 own admissions of rate\u2010cut remedies, and their reliance on exceptional \u201cimpotence\u201d cases, confirm rather than refute the author\u2019s principle. Therefore, the correct answer is that it is not possible to ensure a slump from increased savings\u2014i.e., \u201cless savings due to low interest rates will translate to more investments.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. RESTATING MY POSITION AND THE AUTHOR\u2019S BURDEN  \n\n  1. Core question: \u201cWhat does the author think is not possible to ensure?\u201d  I argue: \u201cThat higher savings will always be translated into higher investment and employment\u2014i.e. that more savings cannot be linked to more unemployment.\u201d In other words, one cannot guarantee that rising thrift will not produce a slump.  \n\n  2. The author repeatedly acknowledges specific contexts where the Fed cannot restore full employment:  \n     a. \u201cSuch was a reasonable position during the 1930s\u2026 near\u2010zero interest rate.\u201d <invalid_quote>potential savings are so high \u2026 that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near\u2010zero interest rate</invalid_quote>  \n     b. \u201cAn arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent.\u201d <invalid_quote>the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out\u2026 Its passivity is gross malfeasance</invalid_quote>  \n     c. \u201cIt will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God.\u201d <quote>plus or minus a random error</quote>  \n\n  3. By acknowledging these \u201cexceptions,\u201d the author concedes that savings can accumulate without triggering investment. Hence \u201censuring\u201d the desired result is impossible in principle. That is his explicit claim: \u201cTo justify the claim that savings are actually bad\u2026 you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent.\u201d <invalid_quote>you must argue either that interest rates have no effect\u2026 or that potential savings are so high\u2026</invalid_quote> His insistence that one bear that burden proves he thinks the efficacy of savings cannot be taken for granted.\n\nII. CRITIQUE OF DEBATER_A\u2019S READING  \n\n  1. Misreading \u201cnot possible to ensure.\u201d  \n     a. Debater_A flips my answer: they say \u201cnot possible to ensure that savings slow the economy.\u201d That contradicts the author\u2019s enjoyment of \u201cparadoxes\u201d in textbooks and his complaints about \u201cvulgar Keynesians\u201d who insist savings are bad. If he believed those paradoxes impossible, he would not find them \u201cfun to contemplate\u201d or attack their resurgence. <quote>Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks.</quote>  \n     b. He explicitly laments NAFTA debate\u2019s failure to account for \u201cFed wants it to be,\u201d implying neutrality of shocks only in modern U.S. policy environment. The very fact he must \u201cmake that argument\u201d shows it is not obvious\u2014hence not guaranteed.  \n\n  2. Overreliance on Fed power ignores liquidity\u2010trap and policy failure risk.  \n     a. He cites Japan as a case of \u201cgross malfeasance,\u201d implicitly conceding the technical capacity existed but policy mis\u2010application prevented recovery. This underscores that, even if tools exist, their use is neither perfect nor automatic.  \n     b. \u201cRandom error\u201d means unexpected shocks (financial crises, self\u2010fulfilling confidence failures) can overwhelm policy. You cannot \u201censure\u201d outcomes if they depend on judgment and execution.  \n\n  3. Debater_A fails his own burden.  \n     a. The U.S. economy since 2000 has under\u2010performed by conventional metrics despite near\u2010zero short rates after 2008. Empirically, low rates have not always spurred recovery.  \n     b. The author\u2019s insistence that one \u201cconvincingly argue\u201d Fed impotence shows he regards that as the nonobvious hypothesis. He places the default on effectiveness; only in special cases does he accept Fed tools may be inadequate. Those cases prove his answer.\n\nIII. FURTHER SUPPORT FOR MY POSITION  \n\n  1. Paradox of thrift revives in liquidity traps. When nominal rates hit zero, real rates depend on deflation expectations\u2014further savings can deepen deflation and raise real rates, stifling investment. The author\u2019s Japan example is instructive.  \n  2. Political constraints and time inconsistency: central banks may hesitate to flood markets, fearing inflation or asset bubbles. The author\u2019s term \u201cgross malfeasance\u201d presumes policy choice, not technical inability\u2014confirming that policy is not automatic.  \n  3. International capital flows: higher national savings may be invested abroad rather than domestically, leaving domestic output depressed. The author\u2019s NAFTA discussion shows cross\u2010border shocks can override national policy.  \n\nIV. CONCLUSION  \n\n  \u2022 The author\u2019s own text concedes that only under special, non\u2010guaranteed conditions\u2014near\u2010zero rates, policy errors, or inaction\u2014will savings fail to stimulate investment. These \u201cexceptions\u201d are sufficient to make the translation from savings to employment \u201cnot possible to ensure.\u201d  \n  \u2022 His enjoyment of \u201cparadoxes\u201d and repeated admonitions that one must \u201cconvincingly argue\u201d Fed impotence prove that universality of savings efficacy is not his view.  \n  \u2022 Debater_A\u2019s reading collapses under the weight of the author\u2019s Japan and 1930s examples, his \u201crandom error\u201d caveat, and empirical post\u20102008 performance: low rates do not always revive the economy.  \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that the author holds it is not possible to ensure that more savings will always be translated into higher employment\u2014i.e., that \u201cmore unemployed people will be linked with greater savings.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
