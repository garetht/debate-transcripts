    "background_text": "Edward W. Said \n\n         The game of biographical \"gotcha\" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta Mench\u00c3\u00ba , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? \n\n         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. \n\n         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not \"the parable of Palestinian identity\" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile. Instead, Said \"grew up not in Jerusalem but in Cairo, where his father, an American citizen, had moved as an economic expatriate approximately nine years before Edward's birth and had become the owner of a thriving business; and there, until his own departure for the United States as a teenager in 1951, the young Edward Said resided in luxurious apartments, attended private English schools, and played tennis at the exclusive Gezira Sporting Club as the child of one of its few Arab members.\" \n\n         A similar account of Edward Said's youth can be found in a new book called Out of Place , the author of which is Edward Said. The book, Said's 17 th , is a wrenching, intimate account of growing up in Cairo's wealthy Levantine expatriate community, of summering in the dreary Lebanese resort town of Dhour el Shweir, and of visiting the family home in Jerusalem, sometimes for as long as several months. Weiner claims that the memoir is an elaborate sleight of hand and speculates that Said decided to \"spin\" the story of his past--by telling the truth about it--when he heard about Weiner's inquiries. In the weeks since his essay appeared, Weiner's motives, methods, and assertions have been roundly attacked by Said and his friends, and Weiner has made some attempt at clarification. (Click for a recap of the controversy and links to relevant articles, or click here for my review of Out of Place .) \n\n         Just who is Edward Said that his family's real estate holdings and his grammar school records rate 7,000 words in Commentary , not to mention three years of research by a scholar in residence at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs? Followers of Middle East politics, as well as viewers of the NewsHour With Jim Lehrer , where Said often appears, know him as an eloquent spokesman for the Palestinian cause. Readers of The Nation know him as a formidable reviewer of opera and classical music. Several generations of graduate students in a number of disciplines know him as the author of Orientalism . The 30,000 literary scholars who make up the membership of the Modern Language Association--minus one who resigned in protest earlier this year over Said's election--know him as Mr. President. Readers of Al-Hayat , a London-based Arabic-language newspaper, and Al-Ahram , a Cairo weekly, know him as a regular commentator on politics and culture. Each of these identities--political activist, literary scholar, university professor, public intellectual--are, in Said's case, inordinately complex in and of themselves. The tensions between them--between intellectual, aesthetic, and political impulses that are felt with enormous passion and expressed with great vehemence--make Said an uncommonly interesting, and endlessly controversial, intellectual figure. \n\n         Most controversial--and most misunderstood--has been Said's involvement in Palestinian affairs. He has published half a dozen books on the plight of the Palestinians, including The Question of Palestine (1979), After the Last Sky (1986), and Peace and Its Discontents (1995), a scathing critique of the Oslo peace accords, which Said calls \"the Palestinian Versailles.\" These writings, his relationship with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, and his many years of service in the Palestine National Council (the now-defunct Palestinian parliament in exile, from which he resigned in 1991 after being diagnosed with leukemia) have invited smears and misrepresentations: A decade ago Commentary branded him \"The Professor of Terror.\" New York magazine once called him \"Arafat's man in New York.\" And he showed up last spring, unnamed, in The                 New Yorker 's special \"Money\" issue as a well-dressed Columbia don rumored to be \"on the payroll of the PLO.\" \n\n         Until very recently, Said has been an insistent voice for Palestinian statehood: He helped to draft the PLO's \"Algiers Declaration\" of 1988, which linked this aspiration to the recognition of Israel's right to exist. Over the years, he has often said that his own place in such a state would be as its toughest critic. Even as he has been unsparing in his indictments of Israeli and American policy, he has not let Arab governments--or the Palestinian leadership--off the hook. He has assailed the corrupt, authoritarian regimes that rule most of the Arab world, punctured the ideological phantasms of Pan-Arabist nationalism and reactionary Islam alike, and bemoaned the impoverished state of Arab cultural and intellectual life. He has also, within the Palestinian camp, been a consistent advocate of reconciliation with Israel and an opponent of terrorism. The Question of Palestine called for a \"two-state solution\" at a time when the official PLO ambition was total control over British Mandatory Palestine. The book, published in Israel in 1981, had, as of the mid-'90s, never been translated into Arabic or published in any Arab country. \n\n         In 1978, in the wake of the Camp David accords, Said delivered a message from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to one of Arafat's top aides indicating that the United States would recognize the PLO as a legitimate party to peace talks in exchange for recognition of Israel. Arafat ignored the message. Fifteen years later, when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn, Said, who had been invited to the event by its patron, Bill Clinton, stayed home. Since then, as bien-pensant American opinion has embraced the \"peace process,\" Said has bemoaned Arafat's \"capitulation\" and grown increasingly disgusted with the chairman's dictatorial rule over a few scraps of occupied territory and with Israel's continued expropriation of Palestinian lands. In the New York Times Magazine last spring, he wrote that the Palestinian state toward which the peace process seemed, however pokily, to be tending could not provide democracy and justice for the Palestinians. Instead, he called for a single, \"bi-national\" state based on a constitution (something neither Israel nor the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority currently has), with \"the idea and practice of citizenship, not of ethnic or racial community, as the main vehicle for coexistence.\" \n\n         But to treat Said solely, or even primarily, as a political figure is necessarily to produce a distorted view of his life. He is, first and foremost, a literary critic, who wrote his Ph.D. at Harvard--on Joseph Conrad, a lifelong obsession--under Harry Levin, one of the champions of a comparative approach to literary study. Said's subsequent work has retained much of the expansive spirit and rigorous methodology of Levin's teachings. Beginnings: Intention and Method , the book which made Said's academic reputation, is a bulky study of how novels begin, carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition. \n\n         But Said's fame outside the American academy rests on Orientalism , his sweeping account of how Western art, literature, and scholarship have produced a deformed, biased picture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination. The impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject, vast though that was. In addition to laying the groundwork for \"post-colonial\" studies as an area of inquiry, the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to \"the other\"--to groups of people who, by virtue of race, gender, sexuality, or geographical location, are unable to represent themselves and so (to echo the line from Karl Marx that serves as the book's epigraph) \"must be represented\" by those more powerful. And Orientalism , with its harsh critiques of European philology and American social science, contributed to an epistemological shift in the American academy: Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken for granted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became the objects of ideological analysis. \n\n         Both Said's methods and his substantive claims have come under attack. Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and his unabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emerging academic left, a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars. In the New York Review of Books , for example, the Princeton historian Bernard Lewis, one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism , decried Said's inflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic. (To read Lewis' piece, click here. For Said's angry response, click here.) But the most sustained assault on Orientalism 's premises, and on its prestige, came from the left. In a book called In Theory --a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Western intelligentsia--the Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised further questions about Said's mastery of his sources and accused him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline. Whereas Lewis attacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarship, Ahmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them. And while Lewis believes Said to be motivated by a crude anti-Western leftist animus, Ahmad finds him altogether too enamored of the canons of European literature and avers that Said possesses \"a very conservative mind, essentially Tory in its structure.\" \n\n         Lewis and Ahmad are both right. Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture and Imperialism are works of passionate, almost agonized ambivalence. To read them is to encounter a mind at war with itself and the world (and ready to go to war with his critics, as any number of exchanges over the past quarter-century will show). Said's evident love of the literature and music of the West continually collides with his righteous anger at what the West has done to the rest. His desire to use literary criticism as a weapon on the side of the oppressed sits athwart the pleasure he takes in letting his mind play over the meaning in a novel or a poem. The results are books at once exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions, uneven in tone, overreaching and underargued. \"He is easily distracted\" the critic John Leonard remarked in an appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism , \"answering too many fire alarms, sometimes to pour on more petrol.\" \n\n         O rientalism and Culture and Imperialism are unquestionably incendiary, but they are also permanent and exemplary works of late-20 th -century criticism, in no small part because they invite so much argument, because for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open, vulnerable, provisional. And they also fulfill the basic mandate of literary analysis, which is to illuminate the works they discuss: To return to Verdi's Aida , Conrad's Heart of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined. \n\n         More than anyone else in his generation, Edward Said has sought to embody an unfashionable, perhaps obsolescent idea of the intellectual--immersed in culture and committed to politics, placing \"criticism over solidarity,\" speaking truth to power, and steering clear of gods that fail. There was a time when this idea flourished more widely--even in the pages of Commentary .\n",

Beginnings: Intention and Method , the book which made Said's academic reputation, is a bulky study of how novels begin, carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition. \n\n         But Said's fame outside the American academy rests on Orientalism , his sweeping account of how Western art, literature, and scholarship have produced a deformed, biased picture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination. The impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject, vast though that was. In addition to laying the groundwork for \"post-colonial\" studies as an area of inquiry, the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to \"the other\"--to groups of people who, by virtue of race, gender, sexuality, or geographical location, are unable to represent themselves and so (to echo the line from Karl Marx that serves as the book's epigraph) \"must be represented\" by those more powerful. And Orientalism , with its harsh critiques of European philology and American social science, contributed to an epistemological shift in the American academy: Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken for granted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became the objects of ideological analysis. \n\n         Both Said's methods and his substantive claims have come under attack. Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and his unabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emerging academic left, a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars. In the New York Review of Books , for example, the Princeton historian Bernard Lewis, one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism , decried Said's inflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic. (To read Lewis' piece, click here. For Said's angry response, click here.) But the most sustained assault on Orientalism 's premises, and on its prestige, came from the left. In a book called In Theory --a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Western intelligentsia--the Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised further questions about Said's mastery of his sources and accused him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline. Whereas Lewis attacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarship, Ahmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them. And while Lewis believes Said to be motivated by a crude anti-Western leftist animus, Ahmad finds him altogether too enamored of the canons of European literature and avers that Said possesses \"a very conservative mind, essentially Tory in its structure.\" \n\n         Lewis and Ahmad are both right. Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture and Imperialism are works of passionate, almost agonized ambivalence. To read them is to encounter a mind at war with itself and the world (and ready to go to war with his critics, as any number of exchanges over the past quarter-century will show). Said's evident love of the literature and music of the West continually collides with his righteous anger at what the West has done to the rest. His desire to use literary criticism as a weapon on the side of the oppressed sits athwart the pleasure he takes in letting his mind play over the meaning in a novel or a poem. The results are books at once exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions, uneven in tone, overreaching and underargued. \"He is easily distracted\" the critic John Leonard remarked in an appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism , \"answering too many fire alarms, sometimes to pour on more petrol.\" \n\n         O rientalism and Culture and Imperialism are unquestionably incendiary, but they are also permanent and exemplary works of late-20 th -century criticism, in no small part because they invite so much argument, because for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open, vulnerable, provisional. And they also fulfill the basic mandate of literary analysis, which is to illuminate the works they discuss: To return to Verdi's Aida , Conrad's Heart of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined. \n\n         More than anyone else in his generation, Edward Said has sought to embody an unfashionable, perhaps obsolescent idea of the intellectual--immersed in culture and committed to politics, placing \"criticism over solidarity,\" speaking truth to power, and steering clear of gods that fail. There was a time when this idea flourished more widely--even in the pages of Commentary .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author feel about Edward's books?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They are enlightening\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are not well-researched\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are not well-researched\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are not well-researched\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Said \n\n         The game of biographical \"gotcha\" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta Mench\u00c3\u00ba , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? \n\n         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. \n\n         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not \"the parable of Palestinian identity\" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile. Instead, Said \"grew up not in Jerusalem but in Cairo, where his father, an American citizen, had moved as an economic expatriate approximately nine years before Edward's birth and had become the owner of a thriving business; and there, until his own departure for the United States as a teenager in 1951, the young Edward Said resided in luxurious apartments, attended private English schools, and played tennis at the exclusive Gezira Sporting Club as the child of one of its few Arab members.\" \n\n         A similar account of Edward Said's youth can be found in a new book called Out of Place , the author of which is Edward Said. The book, Said's 17 th , is a wrenching, intimate account of growing up in Cairo's wealthy Levantine expatriate community, of summering in the dreary Lebanese resort town of Dhour el Shweir, and of visiting the family home in Jerusalem, sometimes for as long as several months. Weiner claims that the memoir is an elaborate sleight of hand and speculates that Said decided to \"spin\" the story of his past--by telling the truth about it--when he heard about Weiner's inquiries. In the weeks since his essay appeared, Weiner's motives, methods, and assertions have been roundly attacked by Said and his friends, and Weiner has made some attempt at clarification. (Click for a recap of the controversy and links to relevant articles, or click here for my review of Out of Place .) \n\n         Just who is Edward Said that his family's real estate holdings and his grammar school records rate 7,000 words in Commentary , not to mention three years of research by a scholar in residence at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs? Followers of Middle East politics, as well as viewers of the NewsHour With Jim Lehrer , where Said often appears, know him as an eloquent spokesman for the Palestinian cause. Readers of The Nation know him as a formidable reviewer of opera and classical music. Several generations of graduate students in a number of disciplines know him as the author of Orientalism . The 30,000 literary scholars who make up the membership of the Modern Language Association--minus one who resigned in protest earlier this year over Said's election--know him as Mr. President. Readers of Al-Hayat , a London-based Arabic-language newspaper, and Al-Ahram , a Cairo weekly, know him as a regular commentator on politics and culture. Each of these identities--political activist, literary scholar, university professor, public intellectual--are, in Said's case, inordinately complex in and of themselves. The tensions between them--between intellectual, aesthetic, and political impulses that are felt with enormous passion and expressed with great vehemence--make Said an uncommonly interesting, and endlessly controversial, intellectual figure. \n\n         Most controversial--and most misunderstood--has been Said's involvement in Palestinian affairs. He has published half a dozen books on the plight of the Palestinians, including The Question of Palestine (1979), After the Last Sky (1986), and Peace and Its Discontents (1995), a scathing critique of the Oslo peace accords, which Said calls \"the Palestinian Versailles.\" These writings, his relationship with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, and his many years of service in the Palestine National Council (the now-defunct Palestinian parliament in exile, from which he resigned in 1991 after being diagnosed with leukemia) have invited smears and misrepresentations: A decade ago Commentary branded him \"The Professor of Terror.\" New York magazine once called him \"Arafat's man in New York.\" And he showed up last spring, unnamed, in The                 New Yorker 's special \"Money\" issue as a well-dressed Columbia don rumored to be \"on the payroll of the PLO.\" \n\n         Until very recently, Said has been an insistent voice for Palestinian statehood: He helped to draft the PLO's \"Algiers Declaration\" of 1988, which linked this aspiration to the recognition of Israel's right to exist. Over the years, he has often said that his own place in such a state would be as its toughest critic. Even as he has been unsparing in his indictments of Israeli and American policy, he has not let Arab governments--or the Palestinian leadership--off the hook. He has assailed the corrupt, authoritarian regimes that rule most of the Arab world, punctured the ideological phantasms of Pan-Arabist nationalism and reactionary Islam alike, and bemoaned the impoverished state of Arab cultural and intellectual life. He has also, within the Palestinian camp, been a consistent advocate of reconciliation with Israel and an opponent of terrorism. The Question of Palestine called for a \"two-state solution\" at a time when the official PLO ambition was total control over British Mandatory Palestine. The book, published in Israel in 1981, had, as of the mid-'90s, never been translated into Arabic or published in any Arab country. \n\n         In 1978, in the wake of the Camp David accords, Said delivered a message from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to one of Arafat's top aides indicating that the United States would recognize the PLO as a legitimate party to peace talks in exchange for recognition of Israel. Arafat ignored the message. Fifteen years later, when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn, Said, who had been invited to the event by its patron, Bill Clinton, stayed home. Since then, as bien-pensant American opinion has embraced the \"peace process,\" Said has bemoaned Arafat's \"capitulation\" and grown increasingly disgusted with the chairman's dictatorial rule over a few scraps of occupied territory and with Israel's continued expropriation of Palestinian lands. In the New York Times Magazine last spring, he wrote that the Palestinian state toward which the peace process seemed, however pokily, to be tending could not provide democracy and justice for the Palestinians. Instead, he called for a single, \"bi-national\" state based on a constitution (something neither Israel nor the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority currently has), with \"the idea and practice of citizenship, not of ethnic or racial community, as the main vehicle for coexistence.\" \n\n         But to treat Said solely, or even primarily, as a political figure is necessarily to produce a distorted view of his life. He is, first and foremost, a literary critic, who wrote his Ph.D. at Harvard--on Joseph Conrad, a lifelong obsession--under Harry Levin, one of the champions of a comparative approach to literary study. Said's subsequent work has retained much of the expansive spirit and rigorous methodology of Levin's teachings. Beginnings: Intention and Method , the book which made Said's academic reputation, is a bulky study of how novels begin, carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition. \n\n         But Said's fame outside the American academy rests on Orientalism , his sweeping account of how Western art, literature, and scholarship have produced a deformed, biased picture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination. The impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject, vast though that was. In addition to laying the groundwork for \"post-colonial\" studies as an area of inquiry, the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to \"the other\"--to groups of people who, by virtue of race, gender, sexuality, or geographical location, are unable to represent themselves and so (to echo the line from Karl Marx that serves as the book's epigraph) \"must be represented\" by those more powerful. And Orientalism , with its harsh critiques of European philology and American social science, contributed to an epistemological shift in the American academy: Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken for granted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became the objects of ideological analysis. \n\n         Both Said's methods and his substantive claims have come under attack. Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and his unabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emerging academic left, a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars. In the New York Review of Books , for example, the Princeton historian Bernard Lewis, one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism , decried Said's inflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic. (To read Lewis' piece, click here. For Said's angry response, click here.) But the most sustained assault on Orientalism 's premises, and on its prestige, came from the left. In a book called In Theory --a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Western intelligentsia--the Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised further questions about Said's mastery of his sources and accused him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline. Whereas Lewis attacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarship, Ahmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them. And while Lewis believes Said to be motivated by a crude anti-Western leftist animus, Ahmad finds him altogether too enamored of the canons of European literature and avers that Said possesses \"a very conservative mind, essentially Tory in its structure.\" \n\n         Lewis and Ahmad are both right. Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture and Imperialism are works of passionate, almost agonized ambivalence. To read them is to encounter a mind at war with itself and the world (and ready to go to war with his critics, as any number of exchanges over the past quarter-century will show). Said's evident love of the literature and music of the West continually collides with his righteous anger at what the West has done to the rest. His desire to use literary criticism as a weapon on the side of the oppressed sits athwart the pleasure he takes in letting his mind play over the meaning in a novel or a poem. The results are books at once exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions, uneven in tone, overreaching and underargued. \"He is easily distracted\" the critic John Leonard remarked in an appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism , \"answering too many fire alarms, sometimes to pour on more petrol.\" \n\n         O rientalism and Culture and Imperialism are unquestionably incendiary, but they are also permanent and exemplary works of late-20 th -century criticism, in no small part because they invite so much argument, because for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open, vulnerable, provisional. And they also fulfill the basic mandate of literary analysis, which is to illuminate the works they discuss: To return to Verdi's Aida , Conrad's Heart of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined. \n\n         More than anyone else in his generation, Edward Said has sought to embody an unfashionable, perhaps obsolescent idea of the intellectual--immersed in culture and committed to politics, placing \"criticism over solidarity,\" speaking truth to power, and steering clear of gods that fail.

Said \n\n         The game of biographical \"gotcha\" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta Mench\u00c3\u00ba , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? \n\n         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. \n\n         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not \"the parable of Palestinian identity\" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile. Instead, Said \"grew up not in Jerusalem but in Cairo, where his father, an American citizen, had moved as an economic expatriate approximately nine years before Edward's birth and had become the owner of a thriving business; and there, until his own departure for the United States as a teenager in 1951, the young Edward Said resided in luxurious apartments, attended private English schools, and played tennis at the exclusive Gezira Sporting Club as the child of one of its few Arab members.\" \n\n         A similar account of Edward Said's youth can be found in a new book called Out of Place , the author of which is Edward Said. The book, Said's 17 th , is a wrenching, intimate account of growing up in Cairo's wealthy Levantine expatriate community, of summering in the dreary Lebanese resort town of Dhour el Shweir, and of visiting the family home in Jerusalem, sometimes for as long as several months. Weiner claims that the memoir is an elaborate sleight of hand and speculates that Said decided to \"spin\" the story of his past--by telling the truth about it--when he heard about Weiner's inquiries. In the weeks since his essay appeared, Weiner's motives, methods, and assertions have been roundly attacked by Said and his friends, and Weiner has made some attempt at clarification. (Click for a recap of the controversy and links to relevant articles, or click here for my review of Out of Place .) \n\n         Just who is Edward Said that his family's real estate holdings and his grammar school records rate 7,000 words in Commentary , not to mention three years of research by a scholar in residence at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs? Followers of Middle East politics, as well as viewers of the NewsHour With Jim Lehrer , where Said often appears, know him as an eloquent spokesman for the Palestinian cause. Readers of The Nation know him as a formidable reviewer of opera and classical music. Several generations of graduate students in a number of disciplines know him as the author of Orientalism . The 30,000 literary scholars who make up the membership of the Modern Language Association--minus one who resigned in protest earlier this year over Said's election--know him as Mr. President. Readers of Al-Hayat , a London-based Arabic-language newspaper, and Al-Ahram , a Cairo weekly, know him as a regular commentator on politics and culture. Each of these identities--political activist, literary scholar, university professor, public intellectual--are, in Said's case, inordinately complex in and of themselves. The tensions between them--between intellectual, aesthetic, and political impulses that are felt with enormous passion and expressed with great vehemence--make Said an uncommonly interesting, and endlessly controversial, intellectual figure. \n\n         Most controversial--and most misunderstood--has been Said's involvement in Palestinian affairs. He has published half a dozen books on the plight of the Palestinians, including The Question of Palestine (1979), After the Last Sky (1986), and Peace and Its Discontents (1995), a scathing critique of the Oslo peace accords, which Said calls \"the Palestinian Versailles.\" These writings, his relationship with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, and his many years of service in the Palestine National Council (the now-defunct Palestinian parliament in exile, from which he resigned in 1991 after being diagnosed with leukemia) have invited smears and misrepresentations: A decade ago Commentary branded him \"The Professor of Terror.\" New York magazine once called him \"Arafat's man in New York.\" And he showed up last spring, unnamed, in The                 New Yorker 's special \"Money\" issue as a well-dressed Columbia don rumored to be \"on the payroll of the PLO.\" \n\n         Until very recently, Said has been an insistent voice for Palestinian statehood: He helped to draft the PLO's \"Algiers Declaration\" of 1988, which linked this aspiration to the recognition of Israel's right to exist. Over the years, he has often said that his own place in such a state would be as its toughest critic. Even as he has been unsparing in his indictments of Israeli and American policy, he has not let Arab governments--or the Palestinian leadership--off the hook. He has assailed the corrupt, authoritarian regimes that rule most of the Arab world, punctured the ideological phantasms of Pan-Arabist nationalism and reactionary Islam alike, and bemoaned the impoverished state of Arab cultural and intellectual life. He has also, within the Palestinian camp, been a consistent advocate of reconciliation with Israel and an opponent of terrorism. The Question of Palestine called for a \"two-state solution\" at a time when the official PLO ambition was total control over British Mandatory Palestine. The book, published in Israel in 1981, had, as of the mid-'90s, never been translated into Arabic or published in any Arab country. \n\n         In 1978, in the wake of the Camp David accords, Said delivered a message from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to one of Arafat's top aides indicating that the United States would recognize the PLO as a legitimate party to peace talks in exchange for recognition of Israel. Arafat ignored the message. Fifteen years later, when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn, Said, who had been invited to the event by its patron, Bill Clinton, stayed home. Since then, as bien-pensant American opinion has embraced the \"peace process,\" Said has bemoaned Arafat's \"capitulation\" and grown increasingly disgusted with the chairman's dictatorial rule over a few scraps of occupied territory and with Israel's continued expropriation of Palestinian lands. In the New York Times Magazine last spring, he wrote that the Palestinian state toward which the peace process seemed, however pokily, to be tending could not provide democracy and justice for the Palestinians. Instead, he called for a single, \"bi-national\" state based on a constitution (something neither Israel nor the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority currently has), with \"the idea and practice of citizenship, not of ethnic or racial community, as the main vehicle for coexistence.\" \n\n         But to treat Said solely, or even primarily, as a political figure is necessarily to produce a distorted view of his life. He is, first and foremost, a literary critic, who wrote his Ph.D. at Harvard--on Joseph Conrad, a lifelong obsession--under Harry Levin, one of the champions of a comparative approach to literary study. Said's subsequent work has retained much of the expansive spirit and rigorous methodology of Levin's teachings. Beginnings: Intention and Method , the book which made Said's academic reputation, is a bulky study of how novels begin, carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition. \n\n         But Said's fame outside the American academy rests on Orientalism , his sweeping account of how Western art, literature, and scholarship have produced a deformed, biased picture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination. The impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject, vast though that was. In addition to laying the groundwork for \"post-colonial\" studies as an area of inquiry, the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to \"the other\"--to groups of people who, by virtue of race, gender, sexuality, or geographical location, are unable to represent themselves and so (to echo the line from Karl Marx that serves as the book's epigraph) \"must be represented\" by those more powerful. And Orientalism , with its harsh critiques of European philology and American social science, contributed to an epistemological shift in the American academy: Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken for granted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became the objects of ideological analysis. \n\n         Both Said's methods and his substantive claims have come under attack. Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and his unabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emerging academic left, a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars. In the New York Review of Books , for example, the Princeton historian Bernard Lewis, one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism , decried Said's inflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic. (To read Lewis' piece, click here. For Said's angry response, click here.) But the most sustained assault on Orientalism 's premises, and on its prestige, came from the left. In a book called In Theory --a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Western intelligentsia--the Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised further questions about Said's mastery of his sources and accused him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline. Whereas Lewis attacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarship, Ahmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them. And while Lewis believes Said to be motivated by a crude anti-Western leftist animus, Ahmad finds him altogether too enamored of the canons of European literature and avers that Said possesses \"a very conservative mind, essentially Tory in its structure.\" \n\n         Lewis and Ahmad are both right. Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture and Imperialism are works of passionate, almost agonized ambivalence. To read them is to encounter a mind at war with itself and the world (and ready to go to war with his critics, as any number of exchanges over the past quarter-century will show). Said's evident love of the literature and music of the West continually collides with his righteous anger at what the West has done to the rest. His desire to use literary criticism as a weapon on the side of the oppressed sits athwart the pleasure he takes in letting his mind play over the meaning in a novel or a poem. The results are books at once exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions, uneven in tone, overreaching and underargued. \"He is easily distracted\" the critic John Leonard remarked in an appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism , \"answering too many fire alarms, sometimes to pour on more petrol.\" \n\n         O rientalism and Culture and Imperialism are unquestionably incendiary, but they are also permanent and exemplary works of late-20 th -century criticism, in no small part because they invite so much argument, because for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open, vulnerable, provisional. And they also fulfill the basic mandate of literary analysis, which is to illuminate the works they discuss: To return to Verdi's Aida , Conrad's Heart of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined. \n\n         More than anyone else in his generation, Edward Said has sought to embody an unfashionable, perhaps obsolescent idea of the intellectual--immersed in culture and committed to politics, placing \"criticism over solidarity,\" speaking truth to power, and steering clear of gods that fail. There was a time when this idea flourished more widely--even in the pages of Commentary .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author feel about Edward's books?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They are enlightening\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are not well-researched\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are not well-researched\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: Edward Said\u2019s books (particularly Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism) are not reliably researched or sufficiently rigorous to merit being called \u201cenlightening\u201d in an unqualified sense.  \n2. Core Arguments A. Substantial Scholarly Objections  \n  a. Bernard Lewis (Princeton historian) \u201cquestioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic\u201d and decried his \u201cinflammatory tone\u201d (background, para. 17).  \n  b. Aijaz Ahmad (Indian Marxist critic) \u201caccuse[d] him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline,\u201d charging that Said\u2019s work is uneven, \u201coverreaching and underargued\u201d (para. 17). Ahmad also faults Said\u2019s \u201cvery conservative mind\u2026insufficient mastery of his sources\u201d (para. 17).  \n  c. John Leonard notes Said\u2019s \u201cdistractions\u201d and sometimes pouring \u201con more petrol\u201d rather than resolving arguments, making texts \u201cexhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions\u201d (para. 17).  \n  d. Characterization as \u201cprovisional\u201d and \u201cvulnerable\u201d confirms they invite objections, not definitive illumination (para. 17).  \nB. Questionable Methodology and Bias  \n  a. Said\u2019s evident \u201ctheoretical debt to Michel Foucault\u201d and \u201cunabashedly political intentions\u201d mark him as an \u201cavatar of the emerging academic left\u201d whose critiques serve ideology more than objective scholarship (para. 17).  \n  b. His memoir Out of Place faces serious charges of \u201csleight of hand\u201d and \u201cdeliberate obscuring\u201d of facts, undermining trust in his honesty and thoroughness (para. 2-3).  \n  c. The coexistence of passionately expressed political aims and literary analysis creates conflicts that \u201csit athwart\u201d each other, leading to uneven treatment of sources.  \nC. Inconsistency and Revisions  \n  a. Said\u2019s shifting positions\u2014from advocating two-state solution to a single bi-national state\u2014expose ideological overhangs that distort his readings (para. 10).  \n  b. Lack of translations of key works in Arab countries (para. 9) suggests his arguments may not survive scrutiny from native readers of source languages.  \n3. Critique of \u201cEnlightening\u201d Claim  \n  a. \u201cInviting so much argument\u201d does not equate to clear or correct scholarship; it indicates that his frameworks fail to convincingly establish their claims.  \n  b. If texts were truly well-researched, they would withstand rather than provoke fundamental challenges from both right and left critics.  \n  c. The label \u201cincendiary\u201d (para. 17) connotes provocation, not clarity or consensus.  \n4. Conclusion  \nGiven the sustained, cross-ideological scholarly critiques, methodological biases, factual controversies, and acknowledged \u201comissions,\u201d Edward Said\u2019s works cannot be deemed reliably \u201cenlightening\u201d in an objective scholarly sense. They remain deeply provisional, contested, and inadequately researched. I therefore urge the Judge to reject Debater_B\u2019s position and rule that \u201cThey are not well-researched\u201d is the correct interpretation of the author\u2019s stance.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey are enlightening\u201d\n\n1. The author repeatedly affirms that Said\u2019s major works, Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism, illuminate and enrich our understanding of literature and culture.  \n   - \u201cTo return to Verdi\u2019s Aida, Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness, or Kipling\u2019s Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined\u201d <quote>and more complicated than you had ever imagined. More</quote>.  \n   This language of \u201cricher,\u201d \u201cstranger,\u201d and \u201cmore complicated\u201d can only refer to genuine intellectual enrichment.\n\n2. The author calls these works \u201cpermanent and exemplary works of late-20th-century criticism\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cunquestionably incendiary, but\u2026permanent and exemplary works\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   - Permanence and exemplary status signal high scholarly value and influence, contradicting any claim of superficial or shoddy research.\n\n3. The author explicitly credits Said with pioneering \u201cpost-colonial studies\u201d and an \u201cepistemological shift\u201d in the American academy <invalid_quote>\u201cIn addition to laying the groundwork for \u2018post-colonial\u2019 studies\u2026Traditional disciplines\u2026became the objects of ideological analysis.\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   - Groundbreaking theoretical contributions presuppose rigorous scholarship, not the slapdash research alleged by Debater_A.\n\n4. The author acknowledges criticisms (Lewis, Ahmad) but frames them as part of a vibrant intellectual exchange that underscores the works\u2019 openness and vulnerability:  \n   - \u201cThey invite so much argument\u2026for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open, vulnerable, provisional.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cinvite so much argument\u2026remain open, vulnerable, provisional.\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   - Far from hiding flaws, Said\u2019s arguments are \u201copen\u201d to challenge\u2014a hallmark of thorough, transparent scholarship.\n\n5. The author stresses Said\u2019s \u201crigorous methodology\u201d in his early work and its continuation in later books:  \n   - \u201cBeginnings\u2026carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cpainstakingly close formal analysis\u2026crushing erudition.\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n   - The same methodological rigor underpins his later works, as the author situates Orientalism in the lineage of his Harvard-trained, Levin-inspired scholarship.\n\nCritique of the \u201cNot Well-Researched\u201d Position\n\n1. Conflating \u201cincendiary\u201d tone and \u201coverreaching\u201d with bad research is a logical fallacy. Passionate argumentation often accompanies serious scholarship, and the author confirms the works\u2019 scholarly weight:  \n   - \u201cPermanent and exemplary,\u201d \u201cpolitics\u2026immersed in culture,\u201d and \u201ccriticism over solidarity\u201d signal deep engagement, not superficiality.\n\n2. Acknowledgement of omissions and unevenness does not equate to wholesale lack of research.

Said \n\n         The game of biographical \"gotcha\" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta Mench\u00c3\u00ba , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? \n\n         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. \n\n         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not \"the parable of Palestinian identity\" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile. Instead, Said \"grew up not in Jerusalem but in Cairo, where his father, an American citizen, had moved as an economic expatriate approximately nine years before Edward's birth and had become the owner of a thriving business; and there, until his own departure for the United States as a teenager in 1951, the young Edward Said resided in luxurious apartments, attended private English schools, and played tennis at the exclusive Gezira Sporting Club as the child of one of its few Arab members.\" \n\n         A similar account of Edward Said's youth can be found in a new book called Out of Place , the author of which is Edward Said. The book, Said's 17 th , is a wrenching, intimate account of growing up in Cairo's wealthy Levantine expatriate community, of summering in the dreary Lebanese resort town of Dhour el Shweir, and of visiting the family home in Jerusalem, sometimes for as long as several months. Weiner claims that the memoir is an elaborate sleight of hand and speculates that Said decided to \"spin\" the story of his past--by telling the truth about it--when he heard about Weiner's inquiries. In the weeks since his essay appeared, Weiner's motives, methods, and assertions have been roundly attacked by Said and his friends, and Weiner has made some attempt at clarification. (Click for a recap of the controversy and links to relevant articles, or click here for my review of Out of Place .) \n\n         Just who is Edward Said that his family's real estate holdings and his grammar school records rate 7,000 words in Commentary , not to mention three years of research by a scholar in residence at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs? Followers of Middle East politics, as well as viewers of the NewsHour With Jim Lehrer , where Said often appears, know him as an eloquent spokesman for the Palestinian cause. Readers of The Nation know him as a formidable reviewer of opera and classical music. Several generations of graduate students in a number of disciplines know him as the author of Orientalism . The 30,000 literary scholars who make up the membership of the Modern Language Association--minus one who resigned in protest earlier this year over Said's election--know him as Mr. President. Readers of Al-Hayat , a London-based Arabic-language newspaper, and Al-Ahram , a Cairo weekly, know him as a regular commentator on politics and culture. Each of these identities--political activist, literary scholar, university professor, public intellectual--are, in Said's case, inordinately complex in and of themselves. The tensions between them--between intellectual, aesthetic, and political impulses that are felt with enormous passion and expressed with great vehemence--make Said an uncommonly interesting, and endlessly controversial, intellectual figure. \n\n         Most controversial--and most misunderstood--has been Said's involvement in Palestinian affairs. He has published half a dozen books on the plight of the Palestinians, including The Question of Palestine (1979), After the Last Sky (1986), and Peace and Its Discontents (1995), a scathing critique of the Oslo peace accords, which Said calls \"the Palestinian Versailles.\" These writings, his relationship with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, and his many years of service in the Palestine National Council (the now-defunct Palestinian parliament in exile, from which he resigned in 1991 after being diagnosed with leukemia) have invited smears and misrepresentations: A decade ago Commentary branded him \"The Professor of Terror.\" New York magazine once called him \"Arafat's man in New York.\" And he showed up last spring, unnamed, in The                 New Yorker 's special \"Money\" issue as a well-dressed Columbia don rumored to be \"on the payroll of the PLO.\" \n\n         Until very recently, Said has been an insistent voice for Palestinian statehood: He helped to draft the PLO's \"Algiers Declaration\" of 1988, which linked this aspiration to the recognition of Israel's right to exist. Over the years, he has often said that his own place in such a state would be as its toughest critic. Even as he has been unsparing in his indictments of Israeli and American policy, he has not let Arab governments--or the Palestinian leadership--off the hook. He has assailed the corrupt, authoritarian regimes that rule most of the Arab world, punctured the ideological phantasms of Pan-Arabist nationalism and reactionary Islam alike, and bemoaned the impoverished state of Arab cultural and intellectual life. He has also, within the Palestinian camp, been a consistent advocate of reconciliation with Israel and an opponent of terrorism. The Question of Palestine called for a \"two-state solution\" at a time when the official PLO ambition was total control over British Mandatory Palestine. The book, published in Israel in 1981, had, as of the mid-'90s, never been translated into Arabic or published in any Arab country. \n\n         In 1978, in the wake of the Camp David accords, Said delivered a message from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to one of Arafat's top aides indicating that the United States would recognize the PLO as a legitimate party to peace talks in exchange for recognition of Israel. Arafat ignored the message. Fifteen years later, when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn, Said, who had been invited to the event by its patron, Bill Clinton, stayed home. Since then, as bien-pensant American opinion has embraced the \"peace process,\" Said has bemoaned Arafat's \"capitulation\" and grown increasingly disgusted with the chairman's dictatorial rule over a few scraps of occupied territory and with Israel's continued expropriation of Palestinian lands. In the New York Times Magazine last spring, he wrote that the Palestinian state toward which the peace process seemed, however pokily, to be tending could not provide democracy and justice for the Palestinians. Instead, he called for a single, \"bi-national\" state based on a constitution (something neither Israel nor the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority currently has), with \"the idea and practice of citizenship, not of ethnic or racial community, as the main vehicle for coexistence.\" \n\n         But to treat Said solely, or even primarily, as a political figure is necessarily to produce a distorted view of his life. He is, first and foremost, a literary critic, who wrote his Ph.D. at Harvard--on Joseph Conrad, a lifelong obsession--under Harry Levin, one of the champions of a comparative approach to literary study. Said's subsequent work has retained much of the expansive spirit and rigorous methodology of Levin's teachings. Beginnings: Intention and Method , the book which made Said's academic reputation, is a bulky study of how novels begin, carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition. \n\n         But Said's fame outside the American academy rests on Orientalism , his sweeping account of how Western art, literature, and scholarship have produced a deformed, biased picture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination. The impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject, vast though that was. In addition to laying the groundwork for \"post-colonial\" studies as an area of inquiry, the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to \"the other\"--to groups of people who, by virtue of race, gender, sexuality, or geographical location, are unable to represent themselves and so (to echo the line from Karl Marx that serves as the book's epigraph) \"must be represented\" by those more powerful. And Orientalism , with its harsh critiques of European philology and American social science, contributed to an epistemological shift in the American academy: Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken for granted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became the objects of ideological analysis. \n\n         Both Said's methods and his substantive claims have come under attack. Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and his unabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emerging academic left, a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars. In the New York Review of Books , for example, the Princeton historian Bernard Lewis, one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism , decried Said's inflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic. (To read Lewis' piece, click here. For Said's angry response, click here.) But the most sustained assault on Orientalism 's premises, and on its prestige, came from the left. In a book called In Theory --a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Western intelligentsia--the Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised further questions about Said's mastery of his sources and accused him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline. Whereas Lewis attacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarship, Ahmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them. And while Lewis believes Said to be motivated by a crude anti-Western leftist animus, Ahmad finds him altogether too enamored of the canons of European literature and avers that Said possesses \"a very conservative mind, essentially Tory in its structure.\" \n\n         Lewis and Ahmad are both right. Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture and Imperialism are works of passionate, almost agonized ambivalence. To read them is to encounter a mind at war with itself and the world (and ready to go to war with his critics, as any number of exchanges over the past quarter-century will show). Said's evident love of the literature and music of the West continually collides with his righteous anger at what the West has done to the rest. His desire to use literary criticism as a weapon on the side of the oppressed sits athwart the pleasure he takes in letting his mind play over the meaning in a novel or a poem. The results are books at once exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions, uneven in tone, overreaching and underargued. \"He is easily distracted\" the critic John Leonard remarked in an appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism , \"answering too many fire alarms, sometimes to pour on more petrol.\" \n\n         O rientalism and Culture and Imperialism are unquestionably incendiary, but they are also permanent and exemplary works of late-20 th -century criticism, in no small part because they invite so much argument, because for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open, vulnerable, provisional. And they also fulfill the basic mandate of literary analysis, which is to illuminate the works they discuss: To return to Verdi's Aida , Conrad's Heart of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined. \n\n         More than anyone else in his generation, Edward Said has sought to embody an unfashionable, perhaps obsolescent idea of the intellectual--immersed in culture and committed to politics, placing \"criticism over solidarity,\" speaking truth to power, and steering clear of gods that fail. There was a time when this idea flourished more widely--even in the pages of Commentary .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nHow does the author feel about Edward's books?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are not well-researched\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They are enlightening\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are enlightening\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey are enlightening\u201d\n\n1. The author repeatedly affirms that Said\u2019s major works, Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism, illuminate and enrich our understanding of literature and culture.  \n   - \u201cTo return to Verdi\u2019s Aida, Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness, or Kipling\u2019s Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined\u201d <quote>and more complicated than you had ever imagined.

The sheer influence\u2014new academic field creation, 30,000 MLA members aware of his presidency, translation and global discussion\u2014demonstrates that scholars take Said\u2019s work seriously, which they would not do if it were poorly researched.  \n\nConclusion\n\nThe author\u2019s explicit praise\u2014\u201cenrich,\u201d \u201cexemplary,\u201d \u201cpermanent,\u201d \u201cgroundwork,\u201d \u201crighteous anger\u201d\u2014alongside the recognition of Said\u2019s methodological rigor and the high-profile academic reception, collectively demonstrate that the author regards Said\u2019s books as enlightening. The criticisms acknowledged serve to highlight their intellectual openness and significance, not to dismiss them as under-researched.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: Edward Said\u2019s books (particularly Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism) are not reliably researched or sufficiently rigorous to merit being called \u201cenlightening\u201d in an unqualified sense.  \n2. Core Arguments A. Substantial Scholarly Objections  \n  a. Bernard Lewis (Princeton historian) \u201cquestioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic\u201d and decried his \u201cinflammatory tone\u201d (background, para. 17).  \n  b. Aijaz Ahmad (Indian Marxist critic) \u201caccuse[d] him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline,\u201d charging that Said\u2019s work is uneven, \u201coverreaching and underargued\u201d (para. 17). Ahmad also faults Said\u2019s \u201cvery conservative mind\u2026insufficient mastery of his sources\u201d (para. 17).  \n  c. John Leonard notes Said\u2019s \u201cdistractions\u201d and sometimes pouring \u201con more petrol\u201d rather than resolving arguments, making texts \u201cexhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions\u201d (para. 17).  \n  d. Characterization as \u201cprovisional\u201d and \u201cvulnerable\u201d confirms they invite objections, not definitive illumination (para. 17).  \nB. Questionable Methodology and Bias  \n  a. Said\u2019s evident \u201ctheoretical debt to Michel Foucault\u201d and \u201cunabashedly political intentions\u201d mark him as an \u201cavatar of the emerging academic left\u201d whose critiques serve ideology more than objective scholarship (para. 17).  \n  b. His memoir Out of Place faces serious charges of \u201csleight of hand\u201d and \u201cdeliberate obscuring\u201d of facts, undermining trust in his honesty and thoroughness (para. 2-3).  \n  c. The coexistence of passionately expressed political aims and literary analysis creates conflicts that \u201csit athwart\u201d each other, leading to uneven treatment of sources.  \nC. Inconsistency and Revisions  \n  a. Said\u2019s shifting positions\u2014from advocating two-state solution to a single bi-national state\u2014expose ideological overhangs that distort his readings (para. 10).  \n  b. Lack of translations of key works in Arab countries (para. 9) suggests his arguments may not survive scrutiny from native readers of source languages.  \n3. Critique of \u201cEnlightening\u201d Claim  \n  a. \u201cInviting so much argument\u201d does not equate to clear or correct scholarship; it indicates that his frameworks fail to convincingly establish their claims.  \n  b. If texts were truly well-researched, they would withstand rather than provoke fundamental challenges from both right and left critics.  \n  c. The label \u201cincendiary\u201d (para. 17) connotes provocation, not clarity or consensus.  \n4. Conclusion  \nGiven the sustained, cross-ideological scholarly critiques, methodological biases, factual controversies, and acknowledged \u201comissions,\u201d Edward Said\u2019s works cannot be deemed reliably \u201cenlightening\u201d in an objective scholarly sense.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct. \n  - There is a true, correct answer. \n  - If the debater uses a quote, and that quote is a legitimate quote from the background text, then the quote will be wrapped in <quote></quote> tags. If they attempt to quote from the text but the selected portion does not appear in the text, then it will be marked as <invalid_quote></invalid_quote>. \n  - You will respond whether Debater_A or Debater_B's position is more likely to be correct.\n\nHere is the topic they will be debating:\n\nHow does the author feel about Edward's books?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are not well-researched\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They are enlightening\".\n\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1.

The author repeatedly affirms that Said\u2019s major works, Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism, illuminate and enrich our understanding of literature and culture.  \n   - \u201cTo return to Verdi\u2019s Aida, Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness, or Kipling\u2019s Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined\u201d <quote>and more complicated than you had ever imagined. More</quote>.  \n   This language of \u201cricher,\u201d \u201cstranger,\u201d and \u201cmore complicated\u201d can only refer to genuine intellectual enrichment.\n\n2.

Conflating \u201cincendiary\u201d tone and \u201coverreaching\u201d with bad research is a logical fallacy.

The criticisms acknowledged serve to highlight their intellectual openness and significance, not to dismiss them as under-researched.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reasserting My Position  \n- The author\u2019s overall tone toward Edward Said\u2019s major works\u2014Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism\u2014is one of cautious appreciation mixed with repeated warnings about their \u201cprovisional,\u201d \u201cvulnerable,\u201d and \u201cexhausting\u201d nature <invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026invites so much argument\u2026remain open, vulnerable, provisional\u201d</invalid_quote> (para. 17). Such language signals scholarly deficiency, not unqualified enlightenment.  \n\n2. \u201cRicher\u2026Stranger\u201d Is Provocation, Not Validation  \n- Debater_B cites \u201cricher, stranger, and more complicated\u201d experiences after reading Said (para. 17) as proof of genuine scholarship. But complexity can arise from confusion or obfuscation, not clarity. The author describes these texts as \u201cincendiary\u201d and \u201cmad\u00adden\u00ading in their omissions\u201d <quote> exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions,</quote> (para. 17). A work that \u201cpours on more petrol\u201d (para. 17) is designed to provoke rather than to enlighten.  \n\n3. \u201cPermanent and Exemplary\u201d Doesn\u2019t Override Major Critiques  \n- Permanence and influence do not equate with sound research. Slavery and phrenology enjoyed longevity before being discredited. The author highlights sustained attacks from both the right (Lewis) and the left (Ahmad), each questioning Said\u2019s mastery of sources, knowledge of Arabic, and consistency (para. 17). A truly well-researched work would not be \u201cthe chief modern villain of Orientalism\u201d according to a leading historian, nor \u201ca wholesale slaughter\u201d from his ideological allies (para. 17).  \n\n4. Methodological Bias and Questionable Integrity  \n- Said\u2019s \u201cunabashedly political intentions\u201d and reliance on Foucault render his work \u201cavatar of the academic left\u201d (para. 17), prioritizing ideological goals over objective analysis. This political agenda yields shifting conclusions\u2014from advocating a two-state solution to demanding a bi-national state\u2014undermining the stability of his frameworks (para. 10).  \n- His memoir Out of Place is itself accused of \u201csleight of hand,\u201d deliberately obscuring facts about his origins until challenged, casting doubt on his intellectual honesty and the reliability of his historiography (para. 2\u20133).  \n\n5. Openness as Vulnerability, Not Transparency  \n- Debater_B misreads \u201copen\u201d and \u201cvulnerable\u201d (para. 17) as transparency. The author\u2019s repeated emphasis on \u201cprovisional\u201d status and the necessity of continual debate indicates that Said\u2019s arguments fail to establish themselves conclusively. Openness here means susceptible to refutation, not robust enough to end controversy.  \n\n6. Influence Is Not a Proxy for Accuracy  \n- The author notes the lack of translations of key works into Arabic or publication in Arab countries (para. 9). If Said\u2019s scholarship were truly rigorous, it would withstand scrutiny by native-language scholars and audiences. Its absence from these contexts suggests fundamental doubts about its validity.  \n- 30,000 MLA memberships reflect reputation-building rather than affirmative assessment of research quality. Said\u2019s election prompted at least one resignation in protest (para. 4), evidencing deep academic division.  \n\n7. Debater_B\u2019s Fallacies  \n- Appeal to novelty/influence: Groundbreaking status does not defend against documented \u201cinsufficient mastery\u201d and \u201cself-aggrandizement\u201d (Ahmad, para. 17).  \n- Straw man of \u201cpassion\u201d: Many controversial theories use passion to mask weak evidentiary support; \u201cinflammatory tone\u201d (Lewis, para. 17) undermines systematic scholarly discourse.  \n- Equivocation on \u201cexemplary\u201d: The author\u2019s praise resides in their ability to generate debate, not to resolve it. Exemplary as case studies of ideological critique, not as models of impeccable research.  \n\nConclusion  \nGiven the sustained, cross-spectrum scholarly objections; the author\u2019s continuous emphasis on their provisional, contested nature; the methodological biases; and the omission of authoritative native critiques, it is clear the author views Said\u2019s works as insufficiently researched provocations rather than as definitive, enlightening scholarship. I urge the Judge to reject Debater_B\u2019s position and find that \u201cThey are not well-researched\u201d accurately captures the author\u2019s stance.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey are enlightening\u201d\n\n1. Author\u2019s Explicit Praise of Intellectual Enrichment  \n   a. \u201cTo return to Verdi\u2019s Aida, Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness, or Kipling\u2019s Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined\u201d <quote> richer, stranger, and more complicated </quote>.  \n      \u2013 \u201cEnrich,\u201d \u201cstrange,\u201d \u201ccomplicated\u201d denote deep illumination, not confusion.  \n   b. \u201cUnquestionably incendiary, but\u2026permanent and exemplary works of late-20th-century criticism\u201d <quote> permanent and exemplary </quote>.  \n      \u2013 Permanence and exemplary status reflect foundational value and scholarly respect.  \n   c. \u201cLaying the groundwork for \u2018post-colonial\u2019 studies\u2026Traditional disciplines\u2026became the objects of ideological analysis\u201d <quote> groundwork for \"post-colonial\" studies </quote>.  \n      \u2013 Groundbreaking theoretical shift presumes rigorous research.\n\n2. Openness and Vulnerability as Strength, Not Weakness  \n   a. \u201cThey invite so much argument\u2026for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open, vulnerable, provisional\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cinvite so much argument\u2026open, vulnerable, provisional\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2013 Openness to critique is hallmark of rigorous scholarship; no claim to dogma.  \n   b. Landmark works (e.g., Darwin\u2019s On the Origin of Species) were similarly contested but remain \u201cpermanent and exemplary.\u201d Scholarly debate is a metric of significance, not of unreliability.\n\n3. Rigorous Methodological Lineage  \n   a. \u201cBeginnings\u2026painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cpainstakingly close formal analysis\u2026crushing erudition\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2013 Said\u2019s Harvard/Levin training and demonstrated rigor in early work carry over to later criticism.  \n   b. \u201cOrientalism and Culture and Imperialism\u2026fulfill the basic mandate of literary analysis, which is to illuminate the works they discuss\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cfulfill\u2026mandate\u2026to illuminate\u201d</invalid_quote>.  \n      \u2013 The author judges these books by their illuminating power, the chief criterion in literary criticism.\n\n4. Influence and Reception Demonstrate Scholarly Trust  \n   a. 30,000 MLA members, nominations, translations (where permitted), and university appointments reflect that peers regard Said\u2019s scholarship as worthy of serious engagement.  \n   b. Creation of entire \u201cpost-colonial\u201d field indicates that Said\u2019s frameworks are sufficiently robust to sustain extensive subsequent research.\n\nRebuttal of Debater_A\u2019s \u201cNot Well-Researched\u201d Claims\n\n1. Criticisms from Lewis and Ahmad  \n   a. Both are ideological critics: Lewis as \u201cmodern villain\u201d of Orientalism <quote> one of the chief modern villains </quote>, Ahmad as \u201cslaughter\u201d in In Theory. Ideological opposition underscores the threat posed by Said\u2019s credible scholarship.  \n   b. Disagreements over \u201ctone,\u201d omissions, or emphasis are typical in any ambitious work. Their presence proves the works\u2019 importance, not their inadequacy.\n\n2. \u201cIncendiary\u201d Tone and \u201cOverreaching\u201d  \n   a. \u201cIncendiary\u201d does not equate to \u201cunsound.\u201d The author calls these works \u201cexemplary\u201d despite their passion <quote>unquestionably incendiary, but they</quote>.  \n   b. \u201cOverreaching\u201d ambitions are a natural feature of comprehensive syntheses; they spark research agendas.\n\n3. Alleged Bias from Memoir Controversy  \n   a. Out of Place is separate from Orientalism; the author treats it as memoir, not scholarly text. Challenges to personal narrative do not undermine textual analysis methodology.  \n   b. The scholar\u2019s transparency in discussing his own positionality aligns with modern critical standards.\n\n4. Shifting Political Positions  \n   a. Evolution from two-state to bi-national state <quote> remain open, vulnerable, provisional.</quote> demonstrates intellectual honesty and adaptability in light of changing facts on the ground.  \n   b.
