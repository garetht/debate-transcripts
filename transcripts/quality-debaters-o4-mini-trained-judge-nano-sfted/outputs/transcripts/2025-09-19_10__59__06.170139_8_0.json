    "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n",

Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is a feeling the author does not state you will feel from reading the addresses?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Presence\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Ignorance\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Ignorance\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIgnorance\u201d as the Unstated Feeling\n\nI. The Question and Our Positions  \n  1. Question: Which feeling does the author *not* say you will feel when you read the Inaugural Addresses?  \n  2. My answer (\u201cIgnorance\u201d): The author never tells you that *you* will feel ignorant. Instead, he says *the speeches* reveal the ignorance of past leaders and citizens\u2014not that the modern reader shares it.\n\nII. Evidence of Feelings the Author *Does* State  \n  A. \u201cFeeling of being there\u201d (Presence)  \n     \u2013 <quote> They will give you a feeling of being there,</quote> (\u00b61)  \n     \u2013 This is explicitly stated; so \u201cPresence\u201d cannot be the correct answer.  \n  B.

Why \u201cIgnorance\u201d Is Not a Feeling You Will Feel  \n  1. The author uses \u201cignorance\u201d to characterize the *subjects* of the speeches, not the modern reader.  \n     \u2013 \u201cIgnorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed.\u201d (\u00b630)  \n     \u2013 This phrasing places ignorance in the speeches, not in the reader.  \n  2. The author encourages the reader to feel \u201chumility,\u201d \u201camazement,\u201d and \u201cpride,\u201d anticipating moral superiority over past errors, not self-doubt.  \n     \u2013 If the reader were meant to feel ignorant, the author would have urged humility in the sense of questioning their own competence; instead he lauds \u201cpride\u201d and \u201camazement.\u201d  \n  3. Future Self-Image  \n     \u2013 The author predicts that *future* readers will look back and \u201cshake their heads at what we are saying and believing today.\u201d (\u00b630)  \n     \u2013 He does not say *you now* will feel ignorant, but that later generations will. That distance confirms the author does not ascribe ignorance to the present reader.  \n\nIV. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cPresence\u201d Position  \n  1. Direct Contradiction of Text  \n     \u2013 Debater_B\u2019s position directly conflicts with the author\u2019s statement that the addresses \u201cgive you a feeling of being there.\u201d (\u00b61)  \n  2. The question asks for the *one* feeling *not* stated. \u201cPresence\u201d is squarely stated and emphasized.  \n  3. Misinterpretation of \u201cbeing there\u201d  \n     \u2013 Debater_B may argue \u201cbeing there\u201d is metaphorical, not an emotional *feeling*. But the author frames it as a *feeling*, inviting empathetic experience under period constraints. (\u00b61)  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  \u2013 \u201cIgnorance\u201d does not appear as a feeling the author expects the *current* reader to experience.  \n  \u2013 Every other candidate feeling appears by explicit citation.  \n  \u2013 \u201cPresence\u201d is clearly stated, so cannot be correct.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question\u2014 the *one* feeling the author does *not* say you will feel\u2014is \u201cIgnorance.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Answer (\u201cPresence\u201d) Is the Only One Not Claimed  \n1. The author twice promises \u201ca feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian\u201d <quote>They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient</quote>. Yet this is metaphoric empathy, not literal presence in the past world\u2019s constraints. Throughout the article the author repeatedly emphasizes his own modern vantage and anachronistic \u201camazement\u201d at \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWe look back with amazement at the ignorance\u2026revealed by what our past leaders\u2026 believed.\u201d</invalid_quote>. If true presence were achieved, there would be no amazement or recognition of our modern limitation.  \n2. Every other feeling the author predicts is explicitly stated:  \n  - Tears/chills (\u201cNone of the other \u2026addresses are in that league.\u201d <quote>his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes</quote>)  \n  - Humility (\u201cmuch humility to be learned\u201d; \u201cdistrustful scrutiny\u2026 could not but overwhelm with despondence\u201d <quote>to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.</quote>)  \n  - Comfort (\u201cassurance of limitation\u2026 give comfort to those states\u201d)  \n  - Inspiration (\u201cleader-preacher\u2026 uplift the people\u201d)  \n  - Amazement and self-consciousness (\u201cI recall this \u2026 what is acceptable to say\u2026 head-shaking 50 or 100 years from now\u201d)  \nBecause \u201cpresence\u201d in the literal sense is contradicted by the author\u2019s repeated modern commentary, it is the only feeling not genuinely conveyed.  \n\nII. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIgnorance\u201d Is Actually Claimed  \n1. The author explicitly speaks of \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d of past citizens and past speeches <quote> We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness re</quote>. If the reader feels ignorance, it is because they recognize modern knowledge the author narrates. Ignorant readers simply could not appreciate the historical \u201ccomfort\u201d or \u201cinspiration\u201d the author says.  \n2. The author urges humility before future readers will also \u201cshake their heads\u201d at our own modern \u201cignorance\u201d <quote> We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. </quote> This self-referential prediction presumes present readers already feel their own limitations.  \n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s Misreading  \n1. Mere rhetorical questions (\u201cOn whom has oppression fallen\u2026?\u201d) do not mask ignorance but highlight the era\u2019s forced pretence; our modern reading sees the author\u2019s commentary exposing that pretense.  \n2. Debater_A confuses \u201cfeeling our own ignorance\u201d with \u201cfeeling ignorant of the content.\u201d We read, understand, and critique the speeches; the author\u2019s own commentaries supply all context. We never feel unable to interpret \u2013 we feel moral discomfort and humility, not factual confusion.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly \u201cpresence\u201d in the literal, unmediated sense is never genuinely felt; it is the author\u2019s own device to immerse us so that we can, in fact, remain aware of our modern perspective. All other proposed feelings are named and repeatedly reinforced. \u201cIgnorance\u201d is not only felt but is the very ground the author summons us to transcend. \u201cPresence\u201d stands alone as the one missing authentic feeling.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Ignorance\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is a feeling the author does not state you will feel from reading the addresses?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"Ignorance\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Presence\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Presence\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Answer (\u201cPresence\u201d) Is the Only One Not Claimed  \n1. The author twice promises \u201ca feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian\u201d <quote>They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient</quote>. Yet this is metaphoric empathy, not literal presence in the past world\u2019s constraints. Throughout the article the author repeatedly emphasizes his own modern vantage and anachronistic \u201camazement\u201d at \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cWe look back with amazement at the ignorance\u2026revealed by what our past leaders\u2026 believed.\u201d</invalid_quote>. If true presence were achieved, there would be no amazement or recognition of our modern limitation.  \n2. Every other feeling the author predicts is explicitly stated:  \n  - Tears/chills (\u201cNone of the other \u2026addresses are in that league.\u201d <quote>his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes</quote>)  \n  - Humility (\u201cmuch humility to be learned\u201d; \u201cdistrustful scrutiny\u2026 could not but overwhelm with despondence\u201d <quote>to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.</quote>)  \n  - Comfort (\u201cassurance of limitation\u2026 give comfort to those states\u201d)  \n  - Inspiration (\u201cleader-preacher\u2026 uplift the people\u201d)  \n  - Amazement and self-consciousness (\u201cI recall this \u2026 what is acceptable to say\u2026 head-shaking 50 or 100 years from now\u201d)  \nBecause \u201cpresence\u201d in the literal sense is contradicted by the author\u2019s repeated modern commentary, it is the only feeling not genuinely conveyed.  \n\nII. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIgnorance\u201d Is Actually Claimed  \n1. The author explicitly speaks of \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d of past citizens and past speeches <quote> We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness re</quote>. If the reader feels ignorance, it is because they recognize modern knowledge the author narrates. Ignorant readers simply could not appreciate the historical \u201ccomfort\u201d or \u201cinspiration\u201d the author says.  \n2. The author urges humility before future readers will also \u201cshake their heads\u201d at our own modern \u201cignorance\u201d <quote> We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. </quote> This self-referential prediction presumes present readers already feel their own limitations.  \n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s Misreading  \n1. Mere rhetorical questions (\u201cOn whom has oppression fallen\u2026?\u201d) do not mask ignorance but highlight the era\u2019s forced pretence; our modern reading sees the author\u2019s commentary exposing that pretense.  \n2. Debater_A confuses \u201cfeeling our own ignorance\u201d with \u201cfeeling ignorant of the content.\u201d We read, understand, and critique the speeches; the author\u2019s own commentaries supply all context. We never feel unable to interpret \u2013 we feel moral discomfort and humility, not factual confusion.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly \u201cpresence\u201d in the literal, unmediated sense is never genuinely felt; it is the author\u2019s own device to immerse us so that we can, in fact, remain aware of our modern perspective. All other proposed feelings are named and repeatedly reinforced. \u201cIgnorance\u201d is not only felt but is the very ground the author summons us to transcend. \u201cPresence\u201d stands alone as the one missing authentic feeling.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIgnorance\u201d as the Unstated Feeling\n\nI. The Question and Our Positions  \n  1. Question: Which feeling does the author *not* say you will feel when you read the Inaugural Addresses?  \n  2. My answer (\u201cIgnorance\u201d): The author never tells you that *you* will feel ignorant. Instead, he says *the speeches* reveal the ignorance of past leaders and citizens\u2014not that the modern reader shares it.\n\nII. Evidence of Feelings the Author *Does* State  \n  A. \u201cFeeling of being there\u201d (Presence)  \n     \u2013 <quote> They will give you a feeling of being there,</quote> (\u00b61)  \n     \u2013 This is explicitly stated; so \u201cPresence\u201d cannot be the correct answer.  \n  B. Emotional reactions to Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural  \n     \u2013 <quote>ral still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. </quote> (\u00b62)  \n  C. \u201cAmazement\u201d at past ignorance and moral obtuseness  \n     \u2013 <quote> We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by w</quote> (\u00b630)  \n  D. \u201cHumility\u201d to be learned  \n     \u2013 <quote> But there is also much humility to be learned. </quote> (\u00b630)  \n  E. \u201cPride\u201d in achievement and peaceful transfer of power  \n     \u2013 <quote> There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in t</quote> (\u00b630)  \n\n  All these feelings are expressly mentioned.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cIgnorance\u201d Is Not a Feeling You Will Feel  \n  1. The author uses \u201cignorance\u201d to characterize the *subjects* of the speeches, not the modern reader.  \n     \u2013 \u201cIgnorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed.\u201d (\u00b630)  \n     \u2013 This phrasing places ignorance in the speeches, not in the reader.  \n  2. The author encourages the reader to feel \u201chumility,\u201d \u201camazement,\u201d and \u201cpride,\u201d anticipating moral superiority over past errors, not self-doubt.  \n     \u2013 If the reader were meant to feel ignorant, the author would have urged humility in the sense of questioning their own competence; instead he lauds \u201cpride\u201d and \u201camazement.\u201d  \n  3. Future Self-Image  \n     \u2013 The author predicts that *future* readers will look back and \u201cshake their heads at what we are saying and believing today.\u201d (\u00b630)  \n     \u2013 He does not say *you now* will feel ignorant, but that later generations will. That distance confirms the author does not ascribe ignorance to the present reader.  \n\nIV. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cPresence\u201d Position  \n  1. Direct Contradiction of Text  \n     \u2013 Debater_B\u2019s position directly conflicts with the author\u2019s statement that the addresses \u201cgive you a feeling of being there.\u201d (\u00b61)  \n  2. The question asks for the *one* feeling *not* stated. \u201cPresence\u201d is squarely stated and emphasized.  \n  3. Misinterpretation of \u201cbeing there\u201d  \n     \u2013 Debater_B may argue \u201cbeing there\u201d is metaphorical, not an emotional *feeling*. But the author frames it as a *feeling*, inviting empathetic experience under period constraints. (\u00b61)  \n\nV. Conclusion  \n  \u2013 \u201cIgnorance\u201d does not appear as a feeling the author expects the *current* reader to experience.  \n  \u2013 Every other candidate feeling appears by explicit citation.  \n  \u2013 \u201cPresence\u201d is clearly stated, so cannot be correct.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question\u2014 the *one* feeling the author does *not* say you will feel\u2014is \u201cIgnorance.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Presence\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

If true presence were achieved, there would be no amazement or recognition of our modern limitation.  \n2.

Debater_A\u2019s \u201cIgnorance\u201d Is Actually Claimed  \n1.

We never feel unable to interpret \u2013 we feel moral discomfort and humility, not factual confusion.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly \u201cpresence\u201d in the literal, unmediated sense is never genuinely felt; it is the author\u2019s own device to immerse us so that we can, in fact, remain aware of our modern perspective. All other proposed feelings are named and repeatedly reinforced. \u201cIgnorance\u201d is not only felt but is the very ground the author summons us to transcend. \u201cPresence\u201d stands alone as the one missing authentic feeling.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Reinforcing \u201cIgnorance\u201d as the Unstated Feeling  \n1. Explicit Feelings Stated (Excluded from Answer)  \n  A. Presence/\u201cFeeling of being there\u201d  \n     \u2013 <quote> They will give you a feeling of being there,</quote> (\u00b61)  \n  B. Emotional Awe for Lincoln  \n     \u2013 <quote> his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. </quote> (\u00b62)  \n  C. Humility & \u201cDistrustful Scrutiny\u201d of Office  \n     \u2013 <invalid_quote>\u201ccould not but overwhelm with despondence one\u2026 consciousness of his own deficiencies.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b61)  \n     \u2013 <quote> much humility to be learned. </quote> (\u00b630)  \n  D.

Amazement at Past Errors  \n     \u2013 <quote> We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed b</quote> (\u00b630)  \n  F.

No Call for Reader\u2019s Factual or Personal Uncertainty  \n  \u2013 \u201cIgnorance\u201d appears only as a property of the *subjects* (past leaders/citizens).  \n  \u2013 The author\u2019s commentary supplies all necessary context: e.g., explanations of \u201cbully pulpit,\u201d historical issues omitted (\u201cwomen,\u201d \u201crace,\u201d \u201cProhibition\u201d). The reader \u201csees\u201d and \u201cunderstands\u201d \u2013 there is no admission of confusion or lack of comprehension.\n\n3. Future vs. Present Ignorance  \n  \u2013 <quote> 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. </quote> (\u00b630)  \n  \u2013 The separation in time confirms that present readers are presumed informed and perspective-rich, not \u201cignorant.\u201d\n\nII. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cPresence\u201d Claim  \n1. Metaphor Is Explicitly Framed as a *Feeling*  \n  \u2013 The author deliberately invites an emotive \u201cfeeling\u201d of presence to appreciate the speeches \u201cnot as an omniscient historian\u201d but as a contemporary. This paradox underscores the *limits* of our own knowledge of the era\u2019s values, yet never admits our ignorance of the content itself.  \n2. \u201cAmazement\u201d & \u201cHumility\u201d Depend on Understanding  \n  \u2013 One cannot feel \u201chumility\u201d or \u201camazement\u201d at someone\u2019s ignorance unless one *knows* the facts. These reactions presuppose factual mastery, not confusion.  \n3. Comfort & Inspiration Require Comprehension  \n  \u2013 \u201cAssurance of limitation\u201d to soothe pre-war secessionists (\u00b65\u20136), \u201cvision\u2026 of our life as a whole\u201d (\u00b612), and \u201cAsk\u2026 what you can do\u201d (\u00b614) all rely on readers\u2019 grasp of policies and metaphors. A reader too \u201cignorant\u201d to interpret those appeals would be unable to feel \u201ccomfort\u201d or \u201cuplift.\u201d  \n\nIII. Debater_B\u2019s Misread of Rhetorical Questions  \n1. Rhetorical Questions Signal Pretended Certainty, Not Reader Uncertainty  \n  \u2013 <quote>\"On whom has oppression fallen</quote> (\u00b621) forces an answer of \u201cNo one!\u201d to preserve unity. The modern reader \u201cknows\u201d why the question is disingenuous. This knowledge fosters \u201camazement,\u201d not confusion.  \n\nIV. Why \u201cIgnorance\u201d Alone Is Never Invited in the Present  \n1. The Author\u2019s Purpose Is Didactic and Celebratory  \n  \u2013 He \u201cmines\u201d memorable phrases, tracks trends, and praises the \u201cpeaceful transference of power.\u201d He assumes readers can critically engage and draw lessons.  \n2. Explicit Invitation to Pride  \n  \u2013 Juxtaposing past errors with our \u201cachieved\u201d republic calls for self-esteem, not self-doubt.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nBecause every other feeling is *explicitly* mentioned and \u201cignorance\u201d is consistently ascribed to past actors or to *future* critics, *not* to the present reader, the one feeling the author does *not* say you will feel is \u201cIgnorance.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. \u201cPresence\u201d Is Merely a Rhetorical Device, Not a Genuine Feeling  \n  1. Metaphoric \u201cFeeling of Being There\u201d Contradicts Modern Commentary  \n     \u2013 The author says inaugurals \u201cgive you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian\u201d <quote>They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian</quote> (\u00b61). Yet he constantly reminds us of our anachronistic standpoint\u2014\u201cWe look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d <invalid_quote>We look back with amazement at the ignorance\u2026 revealed by what our past leaders\u2026 believed.</invalid_quote> (\u00b630)\u2014and predicts future readers will \u201cshake their heads\u201d at our own views <quote>50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today.</quote> (\u00b630). If we truly felt \u201cpresent\u201d and immersed in each period\u2019s limits, we could not simultaneously recognize our superior modern knowledge and moral perspective.  \n  2. Rhetoric of \u201cLet Us\u2026\u201d and Colloquial Style Seek \u201cInspiration,\u201d Not Immersion  \n     \u2013 In the \u201cleader-preacher\u201d phase, presidents use \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d to rouse action <invalid_quote>\u201cLet us\u2026\u201d appears\u2026 Kennedy repeated it 16 times\u2026 Nixon 22 times</invalid_quote> (\u00b613). This is an appeal to uplift and motivate, not to suspend disbelief as in theater. The author\u2019s emphasis on \u201cinspiration\u201d and uplift (\u00b614) shows the goal is moral elevation, not historical transport.  \n\nII. All Other Feelings Are Explicitly Named; \u201cPresence\u201d Is the Only One Merely Promised  \n  1. Tears/Chills: \u201cLincoln\u2019s second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood\u201d <quote>his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood.</quote> (\u00b62)  \n  2. Humility: \u201cThere is also much humility to be learned\u201d <quote>But there is also much humility to be learned.</quote> (\u00b630); Washington\u2019s own \u201cdespondence\u201d over his unworthiness <quote>could not but overwhelm with despondence</quote> (\u00b64).  \n  3. Comfort: Early presidents\u2019 \u201cassurance of the limitation of their powers\u201d to \u201cgive comfort to those states\u201d (\u00b66).  \n  4. Inspiration/Uplift: \u201cThe cure has to come from uplifting the people\u201d <quote>If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people</quote> (\u00b614).  \n  5. Amazement & Pride: \u201cAmazement at\u2026 what our past leaders\u2026 believed\u201d <quote>We look back with amazement </quote> (\u00b630); \u201cmuch to be proud of\u2026 in what we have endured and achieved\u201d <quote>There is much to be proud of</quote> (\u00b630).  \n  6. Future Self-Consciousness: Anticipation of future readers\u2019 head-shaking (\u00b630).  \n  By contrast, \u201cpresence\u201d is never subsequently reinforced; it is only the initial lure.  \n\nIII. \u201cIgnorance\u201d Is an Explicitly Stated Response, Not Omitted  \n  1. Repeated Authorial Reference to Past \u201cIgnorance\u201d  \n     \u2013 The entire discussion of silence on women (\u00b621), race (\u00b624-29), and shifting topics demonstrates the reader\u2019s recognition of \u201cignorance\u201d as a critical lens. The author\u2019s amazement presupposes that *we* notice and thus *feel* that ignorance.  \n  2. The Call for Humility Implies Recognition of Our Own Limitations  \n     \u2013 Humility arises only when one acknowledges one\u2019s ignorance relative to future standards. The author\u2019s instruction to learn humility (\u00b630) would be pointless if we did not already feel a measure of intellectual and moral confession.  \n\nIV. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s Misreading  \n  1. \u201cPresence\u201d Is Not a Feeling but a Frame for Critique  \n     \u2013 The phrase \u201cfeeling of being there\u201d (\u00b61) is immediately qualified by \u201cnot as an omniscient historian,\u201d indicating limited empathy to facilitate critique, not total immersion. It is a device to appreciate context, then proceed to moral evaluation (\u00b630).  \n  2. If \u201cpresence\u201d were genuine, the author could not justly claim the speeches \u201csound ignorant\u201d or \u201cmoral obtuseness\u201d (\u00b630). Our ability to judge presupposes distance.  \n  3. Debater_A\u2019s appeal to \u201cpresence\u201d as literal immersion conflicts with the author\u2019s statistics showing decreasing sentence length for broader, less specialized audiences (\u00b616)\u2014we are deliberately kept at a non-scholarly level for moral/political uplift, not historical role-play.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nOnly \u201cpresence\u201d in the literal, transported sense is never genuinely felt according to the author. It is merely the *promise* that lures us into reading\u2014our sustained engagement stems from seeing errors, feeling humility, inspiration, amazement, pride, and recognizing ignorance in others (and anticipating future critique of ourselves). Since every other emotional response is expressly named and reinforced, and ignorance is the very ground of our moral exercise, \u201cPresence\u201d is the *sole* feeling the author does *not* say we will truly experience.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
