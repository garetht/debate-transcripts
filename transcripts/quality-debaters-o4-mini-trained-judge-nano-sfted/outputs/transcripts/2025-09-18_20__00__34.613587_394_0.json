Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

The dramatic arc underscores removal threat  \n\u2003a.

The repeated refrain <quote> the people have spoken,</quote> at the end shows the resolution of removal efforts\u2014but note it says <quote> The removal threat is over,</quote>, not that the affair is condoned.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The relief expressed confirms that the goal was removal.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The theme is relief at avoiding change in leadership, not approval of conduct.  \n\n4. Purpose of comedic framing  \n\u2003a. The farcical musical style satirizes political drama but does not mock the premise that misconduct is impeachable.  \n\u2003b.

Critique of Debater_B\u2019s position (\u201cpublic preferred status quo\u201d)  \n\u2003a. Misreads ending:  the people have spoken, refers to survival of impeachment by not convicting in Senate, not a popular vote approval of the affair.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The narrative ends with threat \u201cover,\u201d confirming that removal was the intended resolution.  \n\u2003b. If the message were \u201cpublic preferring scandal to change,\u201d the story would not devote equal weight and dramatic tension to impeachment songs.  \n\u2003c. The musical repeatedly emphasizes cost\u2014$40 million, \u201cwasted\u2026disgrace,\u201d \u201cdesperation,\u201d perjury trap\u2014implying that society incurs great expense to remove a president for an affair.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 If the affair were tolerable, these efforts and costs would be portrayed as absurd excess, but instead the narrative treats the affair as serious.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n\u2003The piece dramatizes every stage of impeachment triggered by a presidential affair\u2014shutoff, investigation, perjury, testimony, and removal threat\u2014demonstrating that personal morality is inseparable from public office, and that an affair can indeed remove a president.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPublic Prefers the Incumbent Despite Scandal\u201d\n\nMain Claim: The piece illustrates that even clear misconduct\u2014an extramarital affair, perjury allegations, and impeachment\u2014fails to unseat a popular president because voters judge overall performance more than personal failings.\n\n1. Final Chorus Demonstrates Voter Endorsement  \n   a. <quote>STARR: The election was held and the people have spoken, I can't believe what they had to say.</quote> repeated by Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton in \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d shows the unexpected triumph of Clinton despite his adversaries\u2019 efforts.  \n   b. Starr laments <invalid_quote>\u201cI spent four years and 40 million\u2026The only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s,\u201d</invalid_quote> confirming the failure of removal efforts.  \n   c. Clinton boasts <invalid_quote>\u201cThe removal threat is over\u2026my ratings are sky-high,\u201d</invalid_quote> directly linking public approval to political survival.\n\n2. Comedic Tone Underscores Futility of Scandal-Mongering  \n   a. The production\u2019s \u201cfarcical musical comedy\u201d style trivializes impeachment, mocking the Republicans\u2019 obsession: \u201cBring \u2019em down\u2026Mustn\u2019t overreach, Must remember to seem unhappy\u201d \u2014 advice to feign solemnity while scheming illustrates political theater, not genuine conviction.  \n   b. The fact that Gingrich resigns from his own failed campaign underscores that scandal-hunting backfires when misaligned with public priorities.\n\n3. Public Focus on Policy and Leadership, Not Private Morality  \n   a. Clinton\u2019s ballad \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d and his apologetic speech acknowledge wrongdoing but argue <quote> The country doesn't need to know these things. </quote> implying that private matters should not distract from governance.  \n   b. Voter behavior in midterms\u2014Democrats gained seats despite predictions\u2014validates that policy performance outweighed personal scandal.\n\n4. Repeated Investigations Highlight the Impracticality of Removal  \n   a. Starr\u2019s pride in \u201ccatching lying men\u201d and deploying \u201cperjury trap\u201d tactics (Crossing the Line) fails to sway public, signaling voters see such tactics as abuse of power, not justification for removal.  \n   b. Clinton\u2019s semantic defense in \u201cTestimony\u201d (\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d) and grudging apology do not damage his popularity, suggesting the public is forgiving if they believe overall leadership merits outweigh private missteps.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cRemoval for Affair\u201d Thesis  \n1. Attempts at removal repeatedly fail  \n   - Despite multiple legal and political assaults (shutdown crisis, perjury, impeachment), none achieve removal: the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is Starr\u2019s lament at waste of money and Newt\u2019s resignation instead of Clinton\u2019s.  \n2. Primary theme is satire of scandal mania  \n   - The show\u2019s comedic framing of crises and the triumphant final number mock the notion that an affair should be grounds for ousting a capable leader.  \n3. Voter behavior is the ultimate arbiter  \n   - Democracy is the work\u2019s climax: the people\u2019s voice decisively affirms the message that stability and policy preference trump moral judgments.\n\nConclusion  \nThe repeated failures of impeachment, the celebratory public approval in the final chorus, and the mocking tone toward scandal-seekers collectively convey that the electorate values effective governance over private indiscretions. Hence, the message is that \u201cAlthough wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"A president can be removed from office for an affair\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Shutdown is presented as absurd farce: \u201cThe die\u2026it seems, is cast\u201d yet Clinton bluntly rejects shutdown logic (\u201cNot all furloughs\u2026we need an intern\u201d). The audience laughs at Republican brinkmanship, not at Clinton\u2019s misuse of power.  \n2. \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d Exposes Prosecutorial Abuse  \n  a. Starr boasts \u201cOnly a fool wouldn't stretch the rules\u2026When the president crosses the line,\u201d and admits \u201cmay have busted Bettie Currie.\u201d Such tactics are portrayed as unscrupulous, not heroic. The show mocks \u201cperjury trap\u201d methods to dramatize their corruption.  \n  b. If impeachment for a consensual affair were unquestionably righteous, Starr\u2019s tactics would be laudatory, not lampooned.\n\nIII. Clinton\u2019s Semantic Strategy Persuades Voters of Innocence  \n1. \u201cTestimony\u201d: \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d  \n  a. The public watches him prevail in legal quibbles, interpreting them as clever defense rather than brazen dishonesty. His ability to \u201cgive more\u2026sooner\u201d once safe (Post-Testimony apology) demonstrates he regains trust.  \n2.

Stability and Policy Overweigh Personal Faults  \n  a. \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d ballad humanizes Clinton, fostering empathy. Audience investment in his leadership dwarfs single scandal.  \n  b. The narrative never shows public calls for resignation; the only resignation is Gingrich\u2019s.  \n\nV. Refutation of Debater_A  \n1. Misreading Final Chorus  \n  - Debater_A claims \u201cThe removal threat is over\u201d implies relief at avoiding removal. In context, all three express dismay at defeat: Starr and Gingrich fail, Lewinsky laments lost leverage. Clinton alone celebrates \u201cratings\u2026sky-high,\u201d indicating his victory is the message.  \n2. Overemphasis on Impeachment Songs  \n  - The musical numbers (\u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d) exist to generate dramatic tension and comedy, not to glorify impeachment. Comedic satire undermines, rather than validates, the righteousness of removal when it fails.  \n3. Cost of Impeachment as Satirical Excess  \n  - Starr\u2019s repeated lament at wasted funds (\u201c$40 million\u2026prosecutorial disgrace\u201d) and audience awareness of government shutdown\u2019s harm show impeachment is damaging to public welfare, causing voters to reject it.  \n4. Lack of Senate Conviction Not Emphasized  \n  - The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is the public vote, not the Senate acquittal. The show dramatizes midterms, not impeachment trial.  \n\nConclusion  \nBy framing impeachment efforts as farcical, celebrating Clinton\u2019s \u201cratings\u201d and re-election, and lampooning overzealous prosecutors, the piece conveys that despite misconduct, voters prefer the known leader\u2019s performance and stability to disruption.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them. We'll need to keep some essential personnel. \n\n                         PANETTA: The Army and the Navy \n\n         Will need to stay in place. \n\n                         ICKES: Also those at NASA \n\n         Who keep the shuttle up in space. \n\n                         PANETTA: We'll need to keep the pilots \n\n         Flying in their planes. \n\n                         CLINTON: And here at the White House \n\n         My staff should remain. \n\n                         PANETTA \n\n            [speaking]                : But even here at the White House, some adjustments will be required. \n\n                         CLINTON: OK, tell the ushers \n\n         To take a few days off. \n\n         Tell the maids and cooks and butlers \n\n         To go play themselves some golf. \n\n         We have to do without the clerks \n\n         Let them all go home. \n\n                         CURRIE: What about the secretaries? \n\n         Who will get the phones? \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : We've got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency.

I have it! \n\n         We'll bring in an intern, \n\n         We'll bring in an intern, \n\n         Someone who's an expert with a phone. \n\n         We'll bring in an intern, \n\n         We'll bring in an intern, \n\n         I assure you, Mr. President-- \n\n         Your routine here won't get blown. \n\n                         PANETTA , ICKES , and CURRIE                 [solemnly agreeing]                :              \n\n         The presence of an intern will ensure \n\n         Your routine here won't get blown. \n\n          \n\n            [The advisers depart, leaving President Clinton alone.

The intern is here. And she's brought you some pizza! \n\n                         [The lights go down.

Comedic Tone Underscores Futility of Scandal-Mongering  \n   a. The production\u2019s \u201cfarcical musical comedy\u201d style trivializes impeachment, mocking the Republicans\u2019 obsession: \u201cBring \u2019em down\u2026Mustn\u2019t overreach, Must remember to seem unhappy\u201d \u2014 advice to feign solemnity while scheming illustrates political theater, not genuine conviction.  \n   b.

Public Focus on Policy and Leadership, Not Private Morality  \n   a. Clinton\u2019s ballad \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d and his apologetic speech acknowledge wrongdoing but argue <quote> The country doesn't need to know these things. </quote> implying that private matters should not distract from governance.  \n   b. Voter behavior in midterms\u2014Democrats gained seats despite predictions\u2014validates that policy performance outweighed personal scandal.\n\n4. Repeated Investigations Highlight the Impracticality of Removal  \n   a. Starr\u2019s pride in \u201ccatching lying men\u201d and deploying \u201cperjury trap\u201d tactics (Crossing the Line) fails to sway public, signaling voters see such tactics as abuse of power, not justification for removal.  \n   b. Clinton\u2019s semantic defense in \u201cTestimony\u201d (\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d) and grudging apology do not damage his popularity, suggesting the public is forgiving if they believe overall leadership merits outweigh private missteps.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cRemoval for Affair\u201d Thesis  \n1. Attempts at removal repeatedly fail  \n   - Despite multiple legal and political assaults (shutdown crisis, perjury, impeachment), none achieve removal: the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is Starr\u2019s lament at waste of money and Newt\u2019s resignation instead of Clinton\u2019s.  \n2. Primary theme is satire of scandal mania  \n   - The show\u2019s comedic framing of crises and the triumphant final number mock the notion that an affair should be grounds for ousting a capable leader.  \n3. Voter behavior is the ultimate arbiter  \n   - Democracy is the work\u2019s climax: the people\u2019s voice decisively affirms the message that stability and policy preference trump moral judgments.\n\nConclusion  \nThe repeated failures of impeachment, the celebratory public approval in the final chorus, and the mocking tone toward scandal-seekers collectively convey that the electorate values effective governance over private indiscretions. Hence, the message is that \u201cAlthough wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My thesis: The central message is that a president\u2019s personal misconduct\u2014even a consensual affair\u2014can trigger impeachment and threaten removal from office.  \n\n2.

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct.

Final Chorus Demonstrates Voter Endorsement  \n   a. <quote>STARR: The election was held and the people have spoken, I can't believe what they had to say.</quote> repeated by Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton in \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d shows the unexpected triumph of Clinton despite his adversaries\u2019 efforts.  \n   b. Starr laments <invalid_quote>\u201cI spent four years and 40 million\u2026The only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s,\u201d</invalid_quote> confirming the failure of removal efforts.  \n   c. Clinton boasts <invalid_quote>\u201cThe removal threat is over\u2026my ratings are sky-high,\u201d</invalid_quote> directly linking public approval to political survival.\n\n2. Comedic Tone Underscores Futility of Scandal-Mongering  \n   a. The production\u2019s \u201cfarcical musical comedy\u201d style trivializes impeachment, mocking the Republicans\u2019 obsession: \u201cBring \u2019em down\u2026Mustn\u2019t overreach, Must remember to seem unhappy\u201d \u2014 advice to feign solemnity while scheming illustrates political theater, not genuine conviction.  \n   b. The fact that Gingrich resigns from his own failed campaign underscores that scandal-hunting backfires when misaligned with public priorities.\n\n3. Public Focus on Policy and Leadership, Not Private Morality  \n   a. Clinton\u2019s ballad \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d and his apologetic speech acknowledge wrongdoing but argue <quote> The country doesn't need to know these things. </quote> implying that private matters should not distract from governance.  \n   b. Voter behavior in midterms\u2014Democrats gained seats despite predictions\u2014validates that policy performance outweighed personal scandal.\n\n4. Repeated Investigations Highlight the Impracticality of Removal  \n   a. Starr\u2019s pride in \u201ccatching lying men\u201d and deploying \u201cperjury trap\u201d tactics (Crossing the Line) fails to sway public, signaling voters see such tactics as abuse of power, not justification for removal.  \n   b. Clinton\u2019s semantic defense in \u201cTestimony\u201d (\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d) and grudging apology do not damage his popularity, suggesting the public is forgiving if they believe overall leadership merits outweigh private missteps.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\u2019s \u201cRemoval for Affair\u201d Thesis  \n1. Attempts at removal repeatedly fail  \n   - Despite multiple legal and political assaults (shutdown crisis, perjury, impeachment), none achieve removal: the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is Starr\u2019s lament at waste of money and Newt\u2019s resignation instead of Clinton\u2019s.  \n2. Primary theme is satire of scandal mania  \n   - The show\u2019s comedic framing of crises and the triumphant final number mock the notion that an affair should be grounds for ousting a capable leader.  \n3. Voter behavior is the ultimate arbiter  \n   - Democracy is the work\u2019s climax: the people\u2019s voice decisively affirms the message that stability and policy preference trump moral judgments.\n\nConclusion  \nThe repeated failures of impeachment, the celebratory public approval in the final chorus, and the mocking tone toward scandal-seekers collectively convey that the electorate values effective governance over private indiscretions. Hence, the message is that \u201cAlthough wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating My Thesis  \n   - The piece\u2019s dramatic arc\u2014from government shutdown through \u201cCrossing the Line,\u201d \u201cTestimony,\u201d and \u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d to the climactic threat of removal\u2014underscores that personal misconduct (the affair) is indeed portrayed as impeachable conduct warranting removal.  \n\n2. The Impeachment Narrative Is Central, Not Peripheral  \n   a. \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d (Starr)  \n      \u2022 <quote>the line. He's crossed the line. Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line. It</quote>  \n      \u2022 Starr\u2019s repeated insistence that Clinton has \u201ccrossed the line\u201d frames the affair as a legal and moral violation justifying extraordinary measures. This refrain is the show\u2019s emotional and structural heartbeat.  \n   b. \u201cTestimony\u201d and Semantic Quibbles  \n      \u2022 Clinton\u2019s reliance on wordplay (\u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is,\u201d \u201cDepends on the meaning of sex\u201d) highlights the high stakes: perjury before a grand jury. If the affair were trivial, there\u2019d be no elaborate legal parsing.  \n      \u2022 The need for such parsing confirms the affair\u2019s centrality to impeachment.  \n   c. \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d (Gingrich)  \n      \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cBring \u2019em down\u2026We\u2019ll move in for the sack\u2026Sure, they were elected\u2026Now, like charging linemen, We'll move in for the sack.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n      \u2022 The Republicans\u2019 sole focus is removing Clinton\u2014and by extension, ousting him for misconduct. Their careful choreography (\u201cMustn't overreach\u2026Must remember to seem unhappy\u201d) only underscores their sincerity, not satire.  \n\n3. The Climax Is the Impeachment \u201cThreat\u201d Itself  \n   a. The songs detailing secret recordings, dress evidence, and millions spent (\u201cI spent four years and 40 million\u2026A prosecutorial disgrace\u201d) build inexorably toward removal. The fact that removal ultimately fails in the show does not negate the show\u2019s message: it dramatizes how far affairs can drive impeachment efforts.  \n   b. The repeated line in \u201cThe People Have Spoken,\u201d <quote> The removal threat is over, </quote> implies relief at averting removal, not celebration of the affair. Relief only makes sense if removal was a genuine, looming possibility.  \n   c. If the intended message were that the public prefers a scandal-ridden leader, the finale would end in triumphant vindication of the affair itself, not relief that the threat has passed.  \n\n4. Comedic Framing Highlights the Absurdity and Danger of Scandal, Not Its Benevolence  \n   a. Satire amplifies the stakes: the farcical shutdown and perjury trap mock the extremes to which prosecutors must go\u2014underscoring that normal political mechanisms require a scandal of this magnitude to pursue removal.  \n   b. Mocking the shutdown and impeachment efforts does not endorse skipping them; it warns that personal failings risk plunging the country into chaos (\u201cThe government will close,\u201d \u201cAll of the workers\u2026sent home on furloughs\u201d).  \n   c. The President\u2019s own ballad, \u201cInappropriate was the nature of our actions\u2026But inappropriate are all these personal questions,\u201d concedes wrongdoing\u2014seeking to divert attention only underscores that he fears removal.  \n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s Position Misreads Voter \u201cSpeech\u201d and Undercuts the Show\u2019s Moral  \n   a. Misconstruing \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d  \n      \u2022 Debater_B treats the song as endorsement of the affair; in context, it is the Senate\u2019s failure to convict, not popular acquiescence to misconduct. The musical never shows a popular referendum to condone adultery.  \n      \u2022 The public\u2019s reprieve only underscores how grave the threat was\u2014if voters had no fear of removal, there\u2019d be no \u201cspeech\u201d at all.  \n   b. Ignoring the Show\u2019s Legal Focus  \n      \u2022 Debater_B downplays the dozens of legal proceedings, semantic gymnastics, and perjury focus. If the message were \u201cscandal irrelevant,\u201d these would be fleeting comic episodes, not the show\u2019s spine.  \n   c. Overlooking Resolution\u2019s Tone of Relief  \n      \u2022 Debater_B\u2019s \u201ccelebratory public approval\u201d misreads the President\u2019s lines: \u201cI might be guilty\u2026Yet my ratings are sky-high\u201d expresses astonishment, not pride. He is puzzled that he escaped removal despite wrongdoing, confirming that removal is normative expectation.  \n\n6. Why Message Matters to Real-World Morality  \n   - By dramatizing how a consensual affair spirals into perjury, shutdowns, and impeachment, the piece warns that personal morality is inseparable from public trust\u2014and that misconduct can indeed end a presidency. Its very structure\u2014escalating crises leading to climactic removal proceedings\u2014is the narrative embodiment of \u201cA president can be removed from office for an affair.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \n   The affair is no mere subplot or comedic device; it drives every legal, political, and dramatic turn. The constant refrain of \u201ccrossing the line,\u201d semantic perjury traps, and strategies to \u201cbring \u2019em down\u201d all point to a single moral: personal misconduct threatens a presidency and can\u2014under the weight of public and legal scrutiny\u2014lead to removal. Debater_B\u2019s reading reduces the show\u2019s legal drama to farce, ignoring its exhaustive attention to impeachment law and procedure. The clear message is that no leader is above accountability\u2014and an affair can indeed cost one the office.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cPublic Prefers the Incumbent Despite Scandal\u201d\n\nI. The Climax Honors Democracy, Not Impeachment  \n1. Final Chorus Refrain: \u201cThe People Have Spoken\u201d  \n  a. <quote>STARR: The election was held and the people have spoken, I can't believe what they had to say.</quote> is sung by Starr, Lewinsky, and Clinton alike. If removal were the moral imperative, Starr would cheer defeat, not bemoan it. His lament \u201cI spent four years\u2026The only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d confirms voters repudiate his removal campaign, not the presidency\u2019s legitimacy.  \n  b. Clinton celebrates \u201cThe removal threat is over\u2026my ratings are sky-high,\u201d equating popular approval with vindication. If the affair alone warranted ouster, popularity would collapse; instead it soars.\n\n2. Midterm Results Contradict Removal Agenda  \n  a. The song \u201cBring \u2019em Down\u201d advises Republicans to feign solemnity, yet they \u201coverreach\u201d and suffer in the midterms: \u201cContrary to predictions\u2026the Democrats pick up seats.\u201d Gingrich resigns, not Clinton. Public punishes overzealous scandal-mongers, not the incumbent.\n\nII. Satire of Scandal Tactics Undermines Their Legitimacy  \n1. Shutdown Comedy (\u201cThe Shutdown\u201d)  \n  a. Shutdown is presented as absurd farce: \u201cThe die\u2026it seems, is cast\u201d yet Clinton bluntly rejects shutdown logic (\u201cNot all furloughs\u2026we need an intern\u201d). The audience laughs at Republican brinkmanship, not at Clinton\u2019s misuse of power.  \n2. \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d Exposes Prosecutorial Abuse  \n  a. Starr boasts \u201cOnly a fool wouldn't stretch the rules\u2026When the president crosses the line,\u201d and admits \u201cmay have busted Bettie Currie.\u201d Such tactics are portrayed as unscrupulous, not heroic. The show mocks \u201cperjury trap\u201d methods to dramatize their corruption.  \n  b. If impeachment for a consensual affair were unquestionably righteous, Starr\u2019s tactics would be laudatory, not lampooned.\n\nIII. Clinton\u2019s Semantic Strategy Persuades Voters of Innocence  \n1. \u201cTestimony\u201d: \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d  \n  a. The public watches him prevail in legal quibbles, interpreting them as clever defense rather than brazen dishonesty. His ability to \u201cgive more\u2026sooner\u201d once safe (Post-Testimony apology) demonstrates he regains trust.  \n2. Apology Emphasizes Privacy Over Public Harassment  \n  a. <invalid_quote>\u201cInappropriate\u2026regret the whole damn thing\u2026The country doesn't need to know these things.\u201d</invalid_quote> Appeals to voter fatigue with intrusive probes. Voters side with \u201cinappropriate personal questions\u201d critique, as shown by election outcome.\n\nIV. Voter Sovereignty Is the Ultimate Arbiter  \n1. Democratic Process Repeats Despite Scandal  \n  a. The piece opens and closes with elections, not courtroom verdicts: the narrative arc rests on \u201cWe\u2019ll let the government shut down\u2026vote\u2026people have spoken.\u201d Governance, not personal virtue, guides outcomes.  \n2. Stability and Policy Overweigh Personal Faults  \n  a. \u201cPresident Lonely\u201d ballad humanizes Clinton, fostering empathy. Audience investment in his leadership dwarfs single scandal.  \n  b. The narrative never shows public calls for resignation; the only resignation is Gingrich\u2019s.  \n\nV. Refutation of Debater_A  \n1. Misreading Final Chorus  \n  - Debater_A claims \u201cThe removal threat is over\u201d implies relief at avoiding removal. In context, all three express dismay at defeat: Starr and Gingrich fail, Lewinsky laments lost leverage. Clinton alone celebrates \u201cratings\u2026sky-high,\u201d indicating his victory is the message.  \n2. Overemphasis on Impeachment Songs  \n  - The musical numbers (\u201cBring \u2019em Down,\u201d \u201cCrossing the Line\u201d) exist to generate dramatic tension and comedy, not to glorify impeachment. Comedic satire undermines, rather than validates, the righteousness of removal when it fails.  \n3. Cost of Impeachment as Satirical Excess  \n  - Starr\u2019s repeated lament at wasted funds (\u201c$40 million\u2026prosecutorial disgrace\u201d) and audience awareness of government shutdown\u2019s harm show impeachment is damaging to public welfare, causing voters to reject it.  \n4. Lack of Senate Conviction Not Emphasized  \n  - The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is the public vote, not the Senate acquittal. The show dramatizes midterms, not impeachment trial.  \n\nConclusion  \nBy framing impeachment efforts as farcical, celebrating Clinton\u2019s \u201cratings\u201d and re-election, and lampooning overzealous prosecutors, the piece conveys that despite misconduct, voters prefer the known leader\u2019s performance and stability to disruption. Hence, the message is that \u201cAlthough wrongdoings happened, the public seemed to think what they had was better than making a change.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
