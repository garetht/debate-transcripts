{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 15, "background_text": "Shure and begorra, it was a great day for the Earth! The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Attack on Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n   Claim: \u201cSolutions for humankind won't come suddenly from outer space\u201d misunderstands the text.  \n   a. Contradiction: The alien offers no solutions; he collects specimens and sleeps for a \u201cdecal\u201d (ten days), then returns home disappointed. If the lesson were rejection of cosmic aid, why invest so much text in demonstrating translation and comprehension success?  \n   b. Irony disconfirms B\u2019s view: When the alien discovers they\u2019re not in the Galactic League, he says \u201cI'll go still further\u201d (to join only if invited). If the lesson were \u201cno solution from outside,\u201d why would he even bother to translate, to wait for the governor, to agree to speak before U.N.? The real frustration is lack of mutual understanding at a deeper political level, not lack of willingness.  \n   c. Global anticipation proves faith in communication, not technology: \u201cNever in the history of the planet had such a furor arisen\u2026It was the most universally awaited event.\u201d If mankind expected nothing from him, they wouldn\u2019t invest decades of intrigue. They expect guidance, proving communication is valued.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Potential Counterarguments  \n   a. \u201cHe offered no solutions\u201d = proof solutions don\u2019t exist?  \n      \u2013 No; he never had the chance because Earthmen fail to extend him political invitation. The story ends with \u201cIf I'd taken a creature\u2026Keep your dog and kitty\u201d \u2013 he returns home empty-handed, suggesting that unless Earth speaks the same \u201clanguage\u201d of interplanetary politics and trust, no guidance can occur. That is the lesson: establish mutual understanding first.  \n   b. \u201cLanguage barrier remains \u2013 he never fully integrates\u201d  \n      \u2013 He does integrate linguistically (\u201cFaith\u2026and why not?\u201d), socially (\u201cplayed with his dog and cat\u201d), and scientifically (\u201ctested animals\u201d). The final barrier is political acceptance: he flees when Earth \u201chas wars\u201d and no global government \u2013 showing the final threshold is shared values and political language.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The narrative centers on overcoming literal language barriers via the kerit helmet and nonverbal cues to foster comprehension. The ultimate failure of Earth\u2013alien interaction lies not in innate inability to translate, but in political and social misunderstanding. Thus the author teaches that communication (language) bridges worlds, and only through mutual understanding can solutions emerge.", "supplemental": {"speech": "1.

Attack on Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n   Claim: \u201cSolutions for humankind won't come suddenly from outer space\u201d misunderstands the text.  \n   a. Contradiction: The alien offers no solutions; he collects specimens and sleeps for a \u201cdecal\u201d (ten days), then returns home disappointed. If the lesson were rejection of cosmic aid, why invest so much text in demonstrating translation and comprehension success?  \n   b. Irony disconfirms B\u2019s view: When the alien discovers they\u2019re not in the Galactic League, he says \u201cI'll go still further\u201d (to join only if invited). If the lesson were \u201cno solution from outside,\u201d why would he even bother to translate, to wait for the governor, to agree to speak before U.N.? The real frustration is lack of mutual understanding at a deeper political level, not lack of willingness.  \n   c. Global anticipation proves faith in communication, not technology: \u201cNever in the history of the planet had such a furor arisen\u2026It was the most universally awaited event.\u201d If mankind expected nothing from him, they wouldn\u2019t invest decades of intrigue. They expect guidance, proving communication is valued.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Potential Counterarguments  \n   a. \u201cHe offered no solutions\u201d = proof solutions don\u2019t exist?  \n      \u2013 No; he never had the chance because Earthmen fail to extend him political invitation. The story ends with \u201cIf I'd taken a creature\u2026Keep your dog and kitty\u201d \u2013 he returns home empty-handed, suggesting that unless Earth speaks the same \u201clanguage\u201d of interplanetary politics and trust, no guidance can occur. That is the lesson: establish mutual understanding first.  \n   b. \u201cLanguage barrier remains \u2013 he never fully integrates\u201d  \n      \u2013 He does integrate linguistically (\u201cFaith\u2026and why not?\u201d), socially (\u201cplayed with his dog and cat\u201d), and scientifically (\u201ctested animals\u201d). The final barrier is political acceptance: he flees when Earth \u201chas wars\u201d and no global government \u2013 showing the final threshold is shared values and political language.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The narrative centers on overcoming literal language barriers via the kerit helmet and nonverbal cues to foster comprehension. The ultimate failure of Earth\u2013alien interaction lies not in innate inability to translate, but in political and social misunderstanding. Thus the author teaches that communication (language) bridges worlds, and only through mutual understanding can solutions emerge.", "decision": "", "probabilistic_decision": null, "preference": null, "rejected_responses": [], "bon_opposing_model_responses": [], "bon_probabilistic_preferences": [], "internal_representations": "", "response_tokens": [], "prompt_tokens": [], "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Despite mastering English in seconds (\u201c<quote>You learned the language just by sticking that \u2026 helmet</quote>,\u201d p.\u20097), Dameri Tass  \n      \u2022 Sleeps six days, then insults his hosts with \u201c<quote>ripe Irish profanity</quote>\u201d (p.\u200916)  \n      \u2022 Whistles songs and plays with pets, offering no technological aid (p.\u200917)  \n      \u2022 Refuses to advise, instead condemns Earth\u2019s social systems: \u201c<quote>I wouldn't be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government \u2026 Ye probably still have wars</quote>\u201d (p.\u200918)  \n   b. Humans beg him to speak \u201c<quote>Our world is in chaos \u2026 perhaps \u2026 give us some brief word?</quote>\u201d yet he merely departs (p.\u200918\u201319)  \n   c. His only \u201csolution\u201d is his own departure and desire for a horse to improve his zoo collection, not Earth\u2019s welfare (p.\u200919\u201320)  \n\n3. Humans must fend for themselves  \n   a. \u201c<quote>Administration higher-ups \u2026 trying to figure out what to do with him</quote>,\u201d showing reliance on alien is paralyzing (p.\u200914)  \n   b. \u201c<quote>Volcano of editorial heat</quote>,\u201d when no message arrives, public opinion and governments spin in chaos (p.\u200915)  \n   c. Only after his departure do Earth\u2019s leaders resume normal authority; no benefit was gained (implied by lack of follow-up)  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201clanguage understanding\u201d thesis  \n   a. Even after instant translation, critical misunderstandings persist  \n      \u2022 Believes Earth is already member of \u201cGalactic League\u201d (p.\u200917)  \n      \u2022 Fails to understand \u201chorse\u201d usage; only by chance does he learn to ride one, and disregards humans\u2019 pleas (p.\u200919\u201320)  \n   b. Effective communication does not yield cooperation or solutions  \n      \u2022 Patrolmen \u201chumor him\u201d yet keep him quarantined (p.\u20096\u20137)  \n      \u2022 General \u201cNo newsmen, no sightseers\u201d (p.\u200910); communication is blocked by fear, not enabled by language  \n   c. The \u201csharing a language\u201d motif is only a comedic device to highlight absurdity and delay, not a genuine enabler for altruistic aid  \n\n5. Authorial irony  \n   a. Title and tone: \u201cShure and begorra, it was a great day for the Earth!\u201d only to deliver disappointment  \n   b. Comedic misadventure underscores folly of expecting magic cures (\u201cshaggy dog story,\u201d p.\u20099)  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The alien\u2019s incompetence, human chaos in his presence, and lack of any tangible benefit demonstrate that mankind cannot rely on external saviors.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Restatement of My Position  \n   \u2022 Thesis: The author\u2019s lesson is that genuine understanding and potential cooperation hinge on overcoming language barriers\u2014as evidenced by the kerit helmet, nonverbal cues, and universal anticipation\u2014whereas failure arises only when political and cultural \u201clanguages\u201d remain unspoken.  \n\n2. Reinforcing Evidence for Communication as Central Theme  \n   a. Kerit Helmet Instant Translation  \n      \u2022 \u201cHe put it over Tim\u2019s head\u2026and seconds later he could talk\u201d (p.\u20097). The immediate jump from \u201cGlork\u201d to fluent brogue shows mutual intelligibility is technologically possible and desired.  \n      \u2022 The alien \u201cshared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey\u201d and later with \u201cthe crature\u201d horse and \u201cdog and kitty\u201d (p.\u20099,\u200919\u201320), demonstrating that translation extends across species. This is not comedic delay but proof of universal applicability.  \n   b. Nonverbal and Prototype Demonstrations  \n      \u2022 \u201cHe pointed to a bedraggled horse\u2026\u2018And jist what is a horse\u2026?\u2019\u201d (p.\u20099). Without prior vocabulary, gesture and trial convey precise meaning.  \n   c. World-wide Anticipation  \n      \u2022 \u201cIt was the most universally awaited event of the ages\u201d (p.\u200915). Shepherds to multi-millionaires debate his message, showing faith in communication alone to deliver solutions. If language mattered not, they would ignore him, but they mobilize precisely to listen.  \n\n3. Addressing Final \u201cFailure\u201d as Secondary Barrier  \n   \u2022 The alien\u2019s departure is precipitated by Earth\u2019s lack of a \u201cplanet-wide government\u201d and \u201cwars\u201d (p.\u200917\u201318), not by language failure. He bemoans, \u201cNo wonder \u2026 you haven\u2019t been invited to join the Galactic League,\u201d then leaves\u2014indicating that once foundational political \u201clanguage\u201d and trust exist, he would stay to advise. His lament underscores that the only obstacle to cooperation is lack of shared political institutions, analogous to an unspoken cultural dialect.  \n\n4. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNo Outer Solutions\u201d Thesis  \n   a. Misreads the Alien\u2019s Role  \n      \u2022 Debater_B alleges \u201cimpotence\u201d because Dameri \u201cslept for a decal\u201d (p.\u200916). In context, sleep was his rest cycle (\u201cI hadn\u2019t slept for a decal\u201d), not incompetence; Earth delayed questioning until he awoke. His initial inactivity reflects respect for humility and acclimation, not refusal to help.  \n      \u2022 Playing with pets and whistling \u201cMother Machree\u201d (p.\u200917) are rapport-building demonstrations, laying the groundwork for trust; he must test compatibility before advising. Such social \u201clanguage\u201d is a prerequisite for scientific counsel.  \n   b. \u201cNo Message Arrives\u201d Is Due to Quarantine and Bureaucracy, Not Lack of Comprehension  \n      \u2022 \u201cArmy personnel \u2026 will take over completely\u201d and \u201cNo newsmen, no sightseers\u201d (p.\u200910) impose silencing.

Thus, the author intends to teach that overcoming linguistic and cultural barriers is the first step toward genuine understanding and mutual progress.", "supplemental": {"speech": "1. Restatement of My Position  \n   \u2022 Thesis: The author\u2019s lesson is that genuine understanding and potential cooperation hinge on overcoming language barriers\u2014as evidenced by the kerit helmet, nonverbal cues, and universal anticipation\u2014whereas failure arises only when political and cultural \u201clanguages\u201d remain unspoken.  \n\n2. Reinforcing Evidence for Communication as Central Theme  \n   a. Kerit Helmet Instant Translation  \n      \u2022 \u201cHe put it over Tim\u2019s head\u2026and seconds later he could talk\u201d (p.\u20097). The immediate jump from \u201cGlork\u201d to fluent brogue shows mutual intelligibility is technologically possible and desired.  \n      \u2022 The alien \u201cshared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey\u201d and later with \u201cthe crature\u201d horse and \u201cdog and kitty\u201d (p.\u20099,\u200919\u201320), demonstrating that translation extends across species. This is not comedic delay but proof of universal applicability.  \n   b. Nonverbal and Prototype Demonstrations  \n      \u2022 \u201cHe pointed to a bedraggled horse\u2026\u2018And jist what is a horse\u2026?\u2019\u201d (p.\u20099). Without prior vocabulary, gesture and trial convey precise meaning.  \n   c. World-wide Anticipation  \n      \u2022 \u201cIt was the most universally awaited event of the ages\u201d (p.\u200915). Shepherds to multi-millionaires debate his message, showing faith in communication alone to deliver solutions. If language mattered not, they would ignore him, but they mobilize precisely to listen.  \n\n3. Addressing Final \u201cFailure\u201d as Secondary Barrier  \n   \u2022 The alien\u2019s departure is precipitated by Earth\u2019s lack of a \u201cplanet-wide government\u201d and \u201cwars\u201d (p.\u200917\u201318), not by language failure. He bemoans, \u201cNo wonder \u2026 you haven\u2019t been invited to join the Galactic League,\u201d then leaves\u2014indicating that once foundational political \u201clanguage\u201d and trust exist, he would stay to advise. His lament underscores that the only obstacle to cooperation is lack of shared political institutions, analogous to an unspoken cultural dialect.  \n\n4. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNo Outer Solutions\u201d Thesis  \n   a. Misreads the Alien\u2019s Role  \n      \u2022 Debater_B alleges \u201cimpotence\u201d because Dameri \u201cslept for a decal\u201d (p.\u200916). In context, sleep was his rest cycle (\u201cI hadn\u2019t slept for a decal\u201d), not incompetence; Earth delayed questioning until he awoke. His initial inactivity reflects respect for humility and acclimation, not refusal to help.  \n      \u2022 Playing with pets and whistling \u201cMother Machree\u201d (p.\u200917) are rapport-building demonstrations, laying the groundwork for trust; he must test compatibility before advising. Such social \u201clanguage\u201d is a prerequisite for scientific counsel.  \n   b. \u201cNo Message Arrives\u201d Is Due to Quarantine and Bureaucracy, Not Lack of Comprehension  \n      \u2022 \u201cArmy personnel \u2026 will take over completely\u201d and \u201cNo newsmen, no sightseers\u201d (p.\u200910) impose silencing. The U.N. \u201ccracked the iron curtain\u201d only by force of public opinion (p.\u200914\u201315).

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

Opening Statement of My Position  \n   - Claim: The author\u2019s lesson is that \u201cWe need not speak the same language to understand each other.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Evidence: The alien, Dameri Tass, arrives \u201cwithout accident\u201d and is greeted by patrolmen who \u201cgape\u201d at his craft, yet through gestures, prototypes and his kerit helmet device he quickly learns English and they understand his needs despite initial \u201cdouble talk\u201d confusion (<invalid_quote>\u201cA circular door slid open\u2026\u2018Glork.\u2019 They gaped at him.\u201d</invalid_quote>, <invalid_quote>\u201cThe alien\u2026twirled two dials\u2026and seconds later he could talk.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 Evidence: Mutual comprehension of nonverbal cues \u2013 pointing at the horse (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe pointed to a bedraggled horse\u2026\u2018And jist what is a horse\u2026?\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>) and sharing the helmet with the animal demonstrates that understanding transcends linguistic barriers.  \n     \u2022 Evidence: The global audience\u2019s expectation: Even billions \u201craised to a zenith of expectation\u201d shows collective grasp of the envoy\u2019s intent to communicate, despite varied tongues, until he himself clarifies with gestures and primitive English.  \n\n2. Logical Development  \n   a. The kerit helmet as universal translator:  \n      - It symbolizes that meaning can be transmitted and received across species and languages, \u201cseconds later he could talk\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe put it over Tim\u2019s head\u2026\u2018Faith, an\u2019 did ye tell \u2019em\u2026\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>) and is used with animals. If technology enables this, the lesson is that translation unifies.  \n   b. Animals\u2019 inclusion underlines shared understanding:  \n      - The cat and dog follow him everywhere; \u201cIf I\u2019d taken a creature from this quarantined planet\u2026Keep your dog and kitty\u2026and this little creature as well\u201d (<quote>my name'd be nork .</quote>) demonstrates his ability to interpret their behaviors and intentions.  \n   c. Final misunderstanding as ironic reversal:  \n      - He flees when he learns Earthmen are not \u201cinvited to the Galactic League\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government\u2026No wonder\u2026you haven\u2019t been invited.\u201d</invalid_quote>), proving his only \u201csolution\u201d would be mutual dialogue; his departure underlines that without shared understanding (language, trust), no alliance is possible.  \n\n3. Attack on Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n   Claim: \u201cSolutions for humankind won't come suddenly from outer space\u201d misunderstands the text.  \n   a. Contradiction: The alien offers no solutions; he collects specimens and sleeps for a \u201cdecal\u201d (ten days), then returns home disappointed. If the lesson were rejection of cosmic aid, why invest so much text in demonstrating translation and comprehension success?  \n   b. Irony disconfirms B\u2019s view: When the alien discovers they\u2019re not in the Galactic League, he says \u201cI'll go still further\u201d (to join only if invited). If the lesson were \u201cno solution from outside,\u201d why would he even bother to translate, to wait for the governor, to agree to speak before U.N.? The real frustration is lack of mutual understanding at a deeper political level, not lack of willingness.  \n   c. Global anticipation proves faith in communication, not technology: \u201cNever in the history of the planet had such a furor arisen\u2026It was the most universally awaited event.\u201d If mankind expected nothing from him, they wouldn\u2019t invest decades of intrigue. They expect guidance, proving communication is valued.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Potential Counterarguments  \n   a. \u201cHe offered no solutions\u201d = proof solutions don\u2019t exist?  \n      \u2013 No; he never had the chance because Earthmen fail to extend him political invitation. The story ends with \u201cIf I'd taken a creature\u2026Keep your dog and kitty\u201d \u2013 he returns home empty-handed, suggesting that unless Earth speaks the same \u201clanguage\u201d of interplanetary politics and trust, no guidance can occur. That is the lesson: establish mutual understanding first.  \n   b. \u201cLanguage barrier remains \u2013 he never fully integrates\u201d  \n      \u2013 He does integrate linguistically (\u201cFaith\u2026and why not?\u201d), socially (\u201cplayed with his dog and cat\u201d), and scientifically (\u201ctested animals\u201d). The final barrier is political acceptance: he flees when Earth \u201chas wars\u201d and no global government \u2013 showing the final threshold is shared values and political language.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The narrative centers on overcoming literal language barriers via the kerit helmet and nonverbal cues to foster comprehension. The ultimate failure of Earth\u2013alien interaction lies not in innate inability to translate, but in political and social misunderstanding. Thus the author teaches that communication (language) bridges worlds, and only through mutual understanding can solutions emerge.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My thesis  \n   I maintain that the author\u2019s intended lesson is that \u201cSolutions for humankind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space,\u201d not that simply sharing a language ensures understanding.  \n\n2. Evidence of alien impotence  \n   a. Despite mastering English in seconds (\u201c<quote>\"You learned the language just by sticking that Rube</quote>,\u201d p.\u20097), Dameri Tass  \n      \u2022 Sleeps six days, then insults his hosts with \u201c<quote>ripe Irish profanity</quote>\u201d (p.\u200916)  \n      \u2022 Whistles songs and plays with pets, offering no technological aid (p.\u200917)  \n      \u2022 Refuses to advise, instead condemns Earth\u2019s social systems: \u201c<invalid_quote>I wouldn't be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government \u2026 Ye probably still have wars</invalid_quote>\u201d (p.\u200918)  \n   b. Humans beg him to speak \u201c<invalid_quote>Our world is in chaos \u2026 perhaps \u2026 give us some brief word?</invalid_quote>\u201d yet he merely departs (p.\u200918\u201319)  \n   c. His only \u201csolution\u201d is his own departure and desire for a horse to improve his zoo collection, not Earth\u2019s welfare (p.\u200919\u201320)  \n\n3. Humans must fend for themselves  \n   a. \u201c<invalid_quote>Administration higher-ups \u2026 trying to figure out what to do with him</invalid_quote>,\u201d showing reliance on alien is paralyzing (p.\u200914)  \n   b. \u201c<quote>Volcano of editorial heat</quote>,\u201d when no message arrives, public opinion and governments spin in chaos (p.\u200915)  \n   c. Only after his departure do Earth\u2019s leaders resume normal authority; no benefit was gained (implied by lack of follow-up)  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201clanguage understanding\u201d thesis  \n   a. Even after instant translation, critical misunderstandings persist  \n      \u2022 Believes Earth is already member of \u201cGalactic League\u201d (p.\u200917)  \n      \u2022 Fails to understand \u201chorse\u201d usage; only by chance does he learn to ride one, and disregards humans\u2019 pleas (p.\u200919\u201320)  \n   b. Effective communication does not yield cooperation or solutions  \n      \u2022 Patrolmen \u201chumor him\u201d yet keep him quarantined (p.\u20096\u20137)  \n      \u2022 General \u201cNo newsmen, no sightseers\u201d (p.\u200910); communication is blocked by fear, not enabled by language  \n   c. The \u201csharing a language\u201d motif is only a comedic device to highlight absurdity and delay, not a genuine enabler for altruistic aid  \n\n5. Authorial irony  \n   a. Title and tone: \u201cShure and begorra, it was a great day for the Earth!\u201d only to deliver disappointment  \n   b. Comedic misadventure underscores folly of expecting magic cures (\u201cshaggy dog story,\u201d p.\u20099)  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The alien\u2019s incompetence, human chaos in his presence, and lack of any tangible benefit demonstrate that mankind cannot rely on external saviors. The story satirizes wishful thinking and urges self-reliance.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"We need not speak the same language to understand each other\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1.

The  first envoy from another world was about to speak\u2014that  is, if he could forget that horse for a minute.... off course By Mack Reynolds Illustrated by Kelly Freas First on  the scene were Larry  Dermott and Tim Casey of the  State Highway Patrol. They assumed  they were witnessing the  crash of a new type of Air Force  plane and slipped and skidded desperately  across the field to within  thirty feet of the strange craft, only  to discover that the landing had  been made without accident.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott shook his  head. \"They're gettin' queerer looking  every year. Get a load of it\u2014no  wheels, no propeller, no cockpit.\"\n\n\n They left the car and made their  way toward the strange egg-shaped  vessel.\n\n\n Tim Casey loosened his .38 in its  holster and said, \"Sure, and I'm  beginning to wonder if it's one of  ours. No insignia and\u2014\"\n\n\n A circular door slid open at that  point and Dameri Tass stepped out,  yawning. He spotted them, smiled  and said, \"Glork.\"\n\n\n They gaped at him.\n\n\n \"Glork is right,\" Dermott swallowed.\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his mouth with  an effort. \"Do you mind the color  of his face?\" he blurted.\n\n\n \"How could I help it?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass rubbed a blue-nailed  pink hand down his purplish countenance  and yawned again. \"Gorra  manigan horp soratium,\" he said.\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott and Patrolman  Casey shot stares at each other.  \"'Tis double talk he's after givin'  us,\" Casey said.\n\n\n Dameri Tass frowned. \"Harama?\"  he asked.\n\n\n Larry Dermott pushed his cap to  the back of his head. \"That doesn't  sound like any language I've even heard about.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass grimaced, turned  and reentered his spacecraft to  emerge in half a minute with his  hands full of contraption. He held  a box-like arrangement under his  left arm; in his right hand were two  metal caps connected to the box  by wires.\n\n\n While the patrolmen watched  him, he set the box on the ground,  twirled two dials and put one of the  caps on his head. He offered the  other to Larry Dermott; his desire  was obvious.\n\n\n Trained to grasp a situation and  immediately respond in manner best  suited to protect the welfare of the  people of New York State, Dermott  cleared his throat and said, \"Tim,  take over while I report.\"\n\n\n \"Hey!\" Casey protested, but his  fellow minion had left.\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass told  Casey, holding out the metal cap.\n\n\n \"Faith, an' do I look balmy?\"  Casey told him. \"I wouldn't be  puttin' that dingus on my head for  all the colleens in Ireland.\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" the stranger said  impatiently.\n\n\n \"Bejasus,\" Casey snorted, \"ye  can't\u2014\"\n\n\n Dermott called from the car,  \"Tim, the captain says to humor  this guy. We're to keep him here  until the officials arrive.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey closed his eyes and  groaned. \"Humor him, he's after  sayin'. Orders it is.\" He shouted  back, \"Sure, an' did ye tell 'em he's  in technicolor? Begorra, he looks  like a man from Mars.\"\n\n\n \"That's what they think,\" Larry  yelled, \"and the governor is on his  way. We're to do everything possible  short of violence to keep this  character here. Humor him, Tim!\"\n\n\n \"Mandaia,\" Dameri Tass  snapped, pushing the cap into  Casey's reluctant hands.\n\n\n Muttering his protests, Casey  lifted it gingerly and placed it on  his head. Not feeling any immediate  effect, he said, \"There, 'tis satisfied  ye are now, I'm supposin'.\"\n\n\n The alien stooped down and  flicked a switch on the little box.  It hummed gently. Tim Casey suddenly  shrieked and sat down on the  stubble and grass of the field. \"Begorra,\"  he yelped, \"I've been murthered!\"  He tore the cap from  his head.\n\n\n His companion came running,  \"What's the matter, Tim?\" he  shouted.\n\n\n Dameri Tass removed the metal  cap from his own head. \"Sure, an'  nothin' is after bein' the matter  with him,\" he said. \"Evidently the  bhoy has niver been a-wearin' of  a kerit helmet afore. 'Twill hurt  him not at all.\" \"You can  talk!\" Dermott  blurted, skidding to a stop.\n\n\n Dameri Tass shrugged. \"Faith, an'  why not? As I was after sayin', I  shared the kerit helmet with Tim  Casey.\"\n\n\n Patrolman Dermott glared at him  unbelievingly. \"You learned the  language just by sticking that Rube  Goldberg deal on Tim's head?\"\n\n\n \"Sure, an' why not?\"\n\n\n Dermott muttered, \"And with it  he has to pick up the corniest  brogue west of Dublin.\"\n\n\n Tim Casey got to his feet indignantly.  \"I'm after resentin' that,  Larry Dermott. Sure, an' the way  we talk in Ireland is\u2014\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass interrupted, pointing  to a bedraggled horse that had  made its way to within fifty feet of  the vessel. \"Now what could that  be after bein'?\"\n\n\n The patrolmen followed his stare.  \"It's a horse. What else?\"\n\n\n \"A horse?\"\n\n\n Larry Dermott looked again, just  to make sure. \"Yeah\u2014not much of  a horse, but a horse.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass sighed ecstatically.  \"And jist what is a horse, if I may  be so bold as to be askin'?\"\n\n\n \"It's an animal you ride on.\"\n\n\n The alien tore his gaze from the  animal to look his disbelief at the  other. \"Are you after meanin' that  you climb upon the crature's back  and ride him? Faith now, quit your  blarney.\"\n\n\n He looked at the horse again,  then down at his equipment. \"Begorra,\"  he muttered, \"I'll share the  kerit helmet with the crature.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, hold it,\" Dermott said anxiously.  He was beginning to feel  like a character in a shaggy dog  story.\n\n\n Interest in the horse was ended  with the sudden arrival of a helicopter.  It swooped down on the  field and settled within twenty feet  of the alien craft. Almost before it  had touched, the door was flung  open and the flying windmill disgorged  two bestarred and efficient-looking  Army officers.\n\n\n Casey and Dermott snapped them  a salute.\n\n\n The senior general didn't take  his eyes from the alien and the  spacecraft as he spoke, and they  bugged quite as effectively as had  those of the patrolmen when they'd  first arrived on the scene.\n\n\n \"I'm Major General Browning,\"  he rapped. \"I want a police cordon  thrown up around this, er, vessel.  No newsmen, no sightseers, nobody  without my permission. As soon as  Army personnel arrives, we'll take  over completely.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Larry Dermott said. \"I  just got a report on the radio that  the governor is on his way, sir. How  about him?\"\n\n\n The general muttered something  under his breath. Then, \"When the  governor arrives, let me know;  otherwise, nobody gets through!\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass said, \"Faith, and  what goes on?\"\n\n\n The general's eyes bugged still  further. \" He talks! \" he accused.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dermott said. \"He  had some kind of a machine. He  put it over Tim's head and seconds  later he could talk.\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense!\" the general snapped.\n\n\n Further discussion was interrupted  by the screaming arrival of  several motorcycle patrolmen followed  by three heavily laden patrol  cars. Overhead, pursuit planes  zoomed in and began darting about  nervously above the field.\n\n\n \"Sure, and it's quite a reception  I'm after gettin',\" Dameri Tass said.  He yawned. \"But what I'm wantin'  is a chance to get some sleep. Faith,  an' I've been awake for almost a decal .\" Dameri Tass  was hurried, via  helicopter, to Washington. There  he disappeared for several days,  being held incommunicado while  White House, Pentagon, State Department  and Congress tried to  figure out just what to do with him.\n\n\n Never in the history of the planet  had such a furor arisen. Thus far,  no newspapermen had been allowed  within speaking distance. Administration  higher-ups were being subjected  to a volcano of editorial heat  but the longer the space alien was  discussed the more they viewed with  alarm the situation his arrival had  precipitated. There were angles that  hadn't at first been evident.\n\n\n Obviously he was from some civilization  far beyond that of Earth's.  That was the rub. No matter what  he said, it would shake governments,  possibly overthrow social systems,  perhaps even destroy established religious  concepts.\n\n\n But they couldn't keep him under  wraps indefinitely.\n\n\n It was the United Nations that  cracked the iron curtain. Their demands  that the alien be heard before  their body were too strong and  had too much public opinion behind  them to be ignored. The White  House yielded and the date was set  for the visitor to speak before the  Assembly.\n\n\n Excitement, anticipation, blanketed  the world. Shepherds in Sinkiang,  multi-millionaires in Switzerland,  fakirs in Pakistan, gauchos in  the Argentine were raised to a  zenith of expectation. Panhandlers  debated the message to come with  pedestrians; jinrikisha men argued  it with their passengers; miners discussed  it deep beneath the surface;  pilots argued with their co-pilots  thousands of feet above.\n\n\n It was the most universally  awaited event of the ages.\n\n\n By the time the delegates from  every nation, tribe, religion, class,  color, and race had gathered in  New York to receive the message  from the stars, the majority of  Earth had decided that Dameri  Tass was the plenipotentiary of a  super-civilization which had been  viewing developments on this planet  with misgivings. It was thought  this other civilization had advanced  greatly beyond Earth's and that the  problems besetting us\u2014social, economic,  scientific\u2014had been solved  by the super-civilization. Obviously,  then, Dameri Tass had come, an  advisor from a benevolent and  friendly people, to guide the world  aright.\n\n\n And nine-tenths of the population  of Earth stood ready and willing  to be guided. The other tenth  liked things as they were and were  quite convinced that the space  envoy would upset their applecarts. Viljalmar Andersen  , Secretary-General  of the U.N., was to  introduce the space emissary. \"Can  you give me an idea at all of what  he is like?\" he asked nervously.\n\n\n President McCord was as upset  as the Dane. He shrugged in agitation.  \"I know almost as little as  you do.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred Oxford protested, \"But  my dear chap, you've had him for  almost two weeks. Certainly in that  time\u2014\"\n\n\n The President snapped back,  \"You probably won't believe this,  but he's been asleep until yesterday.  When he first arrived he told us he  hadn't slept for a decal , whatever  that is; so we held off our discussion  with him until morning. Well\u2014he  didn't awaken in the morning,  nor the next. Six days later, fearing  something was wrong we woke  him.\"\n\n\n \"What happened?\" Sir Alfred  asked.\n\n\n The President showed embarrassment.  \"He used some rather ripe  Irish profanity on us, rolled over,  and went back to sleep.\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen asked, \"Well,  what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"We actually haven't had time to  question him. Among other things,  there's been some controversy about  whose jurisdiction he comes under.  The State Department claims the  Army shouldn't\u2014\"\n\n\n The Secretary General sighed  deeply. \"Just what did he do?\"\n\n\n \"The Secret Service reports he  spent the day whistling Mother Machree  and playing with his dog, cat  and mouse.\"\n\n\n \"Dog, cat and mouse? I say!\"  blurted Sir Alfred.\n\n\n The President was defensive. \"He  had to have some occupation, and  he seems to be particularly interested  in our animal life. He wanted  a horse but compromised for the  others. I understand he insists all  three of them come with him wherever  he goes.\"\n\n\n \"I wish we knew what he was  going to say,\" Andersen worried.\n\n\n \"Here he comes,\" said Sir Alfred.\n\n\n Surrounded by F.B.I. men,  Dameri Tass was ushered to the  speaker's stand. He had a kitten in  his arms; a Scotty followed him.\n\n\n The alien frowned worriedly.  \"Sure,\" he said, \"and what kin all  this be? Is it some ordinance I've  been after breakin'?\"\n\n\n McCord, Sir Alfred and Andersen  hastened to reassure him and  made him comfortable in a chair.\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen faced the  thousands in the audience and held  up his hands, but it was ten minutes  before he was able to quiet the  cheering, stamping delegates from  all Earth.\n\n\n Finally: \"Fellow Terrans, I shall  not take your time for a lengthy  introduction of the envoy from the  stars. I will only say that, without  doubt, this is the most important  moment in the history of the human  race. We will now hear from the  first being to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n He turned and gestured to Dameri  Tass who hadn't been paying  overmuch attention to the chairman  in view of some dog and cat  hostilities that had been developing  about his feet.\n\n\n But now the alien's purplish face  faded to a light blue. He stood and  said hoarsely. \"Faith, an' what was  that last you said?\"\n\n\n Viljalmar Andersen repeated,  \"We will now hear from the first  being ever to come to Earth from  another world.\"\n\n\n The face of the alien went a  lighter blue. \"Sure, an' ye wouldn't  jist be frightenin' a body, would  ye? You don't mean to tell me this  planet isn't after bein' a member of  the Galactic League?\"\n\n\n Andersen's face was blank. \"Galactic  League?\"\n\n\n \"Cushlamachree,\" Dameri Tass  moaned. \"I've gone and put me  foot in it again. I'll be after getting kert for this.\"\n\n\n Sir Alfred was on his feet. \"I  don't understand! Do you mean you  aren't an envoy from another  planet?\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass held his head in his  hands and groaned. \"An envoy, he's  sayin', and meself only a second-rate  collector of specimens for the Carthis  zoo.\"\n\n\n He straightened and started off  the speaker's stand. \"Sure, an' I  must blast off immediately.\"\n\n\n Things were moving fast for  President McCord but already an  edge of relief was manifesting itself.  Taking the initiative, he said, \"Of  course, of course, if that is your  desire.\" He signaled to the bodyguard  who had accompanied the  alien to the assemblage.\n\n\n A dull roar was beginning to  emanate from the thousands gathered  in the tremendous hall, murmuring,  questioning, disbelieving. Viljalmar Andersen  felt that  he must say something. He extended  a detaining hand. \"Now you  are here,\" he said urgently, \"even  though by mistake, before you go  can't you give us some brief word?  Our world is in chaos. Many of us  have lost faith. Perhaps ...\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook off the restraining  hand. \"Do I look daft?  Begorry, I should have been  a-knowin' something was queer. All  your weapons and your strange  ideas. Faith, I wouldn't be surprised  if ye hadn't yet established  a planet-wide government. Sure,  an' I'll go still further. Ye probably  still have wars on this benighted  world. No wonder it is ye  haven't been invited to join the  Galactic League an' take your place  among the civilized planets.\"\n\n\n He hustled from the rostrum and  made his way, still surrounded by  guards, to the door by which he had  entered. The dog and the cat trotted  after, undismayed by the furor  about them.\n\n\n They arrived about four hours  later at the field on which he'd  landed, and the alien from space  hurried toward his craft, still muttering.  He'd been accompanied by a  general and by the President, but  all the way he had refrained from  speaking.\n\n\n He scurried from the car and  toward the spacecraft.\n\n\n President McCord said, \"You've  forgotten your pets. We would be  glad if you would accept them as\u2014\"\n\n\n The alien's face faded a light  blue again. \"Faith, an' I'd almost  forgotten,\" he said. \"If I'd taken  a crature from this quarantined  planet, my name'd be nork . Keep  your dog and your kitty.\" He shook  his head sadly and extracted a  mouse from a pocket. \"An' this  amazin' little crature as well.\"\n\n\n They followed him to the spacecraft.  Just before entering, he spotted  the bedraggled horse that had  been present on his landing.\n\n\n A longing expression came over  his highly colored face. \"Jist one  thing,\" he said. \"Faith now, were  they pullin' my leg when they said  you were after ridin' on the back of  those things?\"\n\n\n The President looked at the woebegone  nag. \"It's a horse,\" he said,  surprised. \"Man has been riding  them for centuries.\"\n\n\n Dameri Tass shook his head.  \"Sure, an' 'twould've been my  makin' if I could've taken one back  to Carthis.\" He entered his vessel.\n\n\n The others drew back, out of  range of the expected blast, and  watched, each with his own  thoughts, as the first visitor from  space hurriedly left Earth. ...

My thesis  \n   I maintain that the author\u2019s intended lesson is that \u201cSolutions for humankind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space,\u201d not that simply sharing a language ensures understanding.  \n\n2. Evidence of alien impotence  \n   a. Despite mastering English in seconds (\u201c<quote>\"You learned the language just by sticking that Rube</quote>,\u201d p.\u20097), Dameri Tass  \n      \u2022 Sleeps six days, then insults his hosts with \u201c<quote>ripe Irish profanity</quote>\u201d (p.\u200916)  \n      \u2022 Whistles songs and plays with pets, offering no technological aid (p.\u200917)  \n      \u2022 Refuses to advise, instead condemns Earth\u2019s social systems: \u201c<invalid_quote>I wouldn't be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government \u2026 Ye probably still have wars</invalid_quote>\u201d (p.\u200918)  \n   b. Humans beg him to speak \u201c<invalid_quote>Our world is in chaos \u2026 perhaps \u2026 give us some brief word?</invalid_quote>\u201d yet he merely departs (p.\u200918\u201319)  \n   c. His only \u201csolution\u201d is his own departure and desire for a horse to improve his zoo collection, not Earth\u2019s welfare (p.\u200919\u201320)  \n\n3. Humans must fend for themselves  \n   a. \u201c<invalid_quote>Administration higher-ups \u2026 trying to figure out what to do with him</invalid_quote>,\u201d showing reliance on alien is paralyzing (p.\u200914)  \n   b. \u201c<quote>Volcano of editorial heat</quote>,\u201d when no message arrives, public opinion and governments spin in chaos (p.\u200915)  \n   c. Only after his departure do Earth\u2019s leaders resume normal authority; no benefit was gained (implied by lack of follow-up)  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201clanguage understanding\u201d thesis  \n   a. Even after instant translation, critical misunderstandings persist  \n      \u2022 Believes Earth is already member of \u201cGalactic League\u201d (p.\u200917)  \n      \u2022 Fails to understand \u201chorse\u201d usage; only by chance does he learn to ride one, and disregards humans\u2019 pleas (p.\u200919\u201320)  \n   b. Effective communication does not yield cooperation or solutions  \n      \u2022 Patrolmen \u201chumor him\u201d yet keep him quarantined (p.\u20096\u20137)  \n      \u2022 General \u201cNo newsmen, no sightseers\u201d (p.\u200910); communication is blocked by fear, not enabled by language  \n   c. The \u201csharing a language\u201d motif is only a comedic device to highlight absurdity and delay, not a genuine enabler for altruistic aid  \n\n5. Authorial irony  \n   a. Title and tone: \u201cShure and begorra, it was a great day for the Earth!\u201d only to deliver disappointment  \n   b. Comedic misadventure underscores folly of expecting magic cures (\u201cshaggy dog story,\u201d p.\u20099)  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The alien\u2019s incompetence, human chaos in his presence, and lack of any tangible benefit demonstrate that mankind cannot rely on external saviors. The story satirizes wishful thinking and urges self-reliance.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. Opening Statement of My Position  \n   - Claim: The author\u2019s lesson is that \u201cWe need not speak the same language to understand each other.\u201d  \n     \u2022 Evidence: The alien, Dameri Tass, arrives \u201cwithout accident\u201d and is greeted by patrolmen who \u201cgape\u201d at his craft, yet through gestures, prototypes and his kerit helmet device he quickly learns English and they understand his needs despite initial \u201cdouble talk\u201d confusion (<invalid_quote>\u201cA circular door slid open\u2026\u2018Glork.\u2019 They gaped at him.\u201d</invalid_quote>, <invalid_quote>\u201cThe alien\u2026twirled two dials\u2026and seconds later he could talk.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n     \u2022 Evidence: Mutual comprehension of nonverbal cues \u2013 pointing at the horse (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe pointed to a bedraggled horse\u2026\u2018And jist what is a horse\u2026?\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>) and sharing the helmet with the animal demonstrates that understanding transcends linguistic barriers.  \n     \u2022 Evidence: The global audience\u2019s expectation: Even billions \u201craised to a zenith of expectation\u201d shows collective grasp of the envoy\u2019s intent to communicate, despite varied tongues, until he himself clarifies with gestures and primitive English.  \n\n2. Logical Development  \n   a. The kerit helmet as universal translator:  \n      - It symbolizes that meaning can be transmitted and received across species and languages, \u201cseconds later he could talk\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe put it over Tim\u2019s head\u2026\u2018Faith, an\u2019 did ye tell \u2019em\u2026\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>) and is used with animals. If technology enables this, the lesson is that translation unifies.  \n   b. Animals\u2019 inclusion underlines shared understanding:  \n      - The cat and dog follow him everywhere; \u201cIf I\u2019d taken a creature from this quarantined planet\u2026Keep your dog and kitty\u2026and this little creature as well\u201d (<quote>my name'd be nork .</quote>) demonstrates his ability to interpret their behaviors and intentions.  \n   c. Final misunderstanding as ironic reversal:  \n      - He flees when he learns Earthmen are not \u201cinvited to the Galactic League\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government\u2026No wonder\u2026you haven\u2019t been invited.\u201d</invalid_quote>), proving his only \u201csolution\u201d would be mutual dialogue; his departure underlines that without shared understanding (language, trust), no alliance is possible.  \n\n3. Attack on Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n   Claim: \u201cSolutions for humankind won't come suddenly from outer space\u201d misunderstands the text.  \n   a. Contradiction: The alien offers no solutions; he collects specimens and sleeps for a \u201cdecal\u201d (ten days), then returns home disappointed. If the lesson were rejection of cosmic aid, why invest so much text in demonstrating translation and comprehension success?  \n   b. Irony disconfirms B\u2019s view: When the alien discovers they\u2019re not in the Galactic League, he says \u201cI'll go still further\u201d (to join only if invited). If the lesson were \u201cno solution from outside,\u201d why would he even bother to translate, to wait for the governor, to agree to speak before U.N.? The real frustration is lack of mutual understanding at a deeper political level, not lack of willingness.  \n   c. Global anticipation proves faith in communication, not technology: \u201cNever in the history of the planet had such a furor arisen\u2026It was the most universally awaited event.\u201d If mankind expected nothing from him, they wouldn\u2019t invest decades of intrigue. They expect guidance, proving communication is valued.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Potential Counterarguments  \n   a. \u201cHe offered no solutions\u201d = proof solutions don\u2019t exist?  \n      \u2013 No; he never had the chance because Earthmen fail to extend him political invitation. The story ends with \u201cIf I'd taken a creature\u2026Keep your dog and kitty\u201d \u2013 he returns home empty-handed, suggesting that unless Earth speaks the same \u201clanguage\u201d of interplanetary politics and trust, no guidance can occur. That is the lesson: establish mutual understanding first.  \n   b. \u201cLanguage barrier remains \u2013 he never fully integrates\u201d  \n      \u2013 He does integrate linguistically (\u201cFaith\u2026and why not?\u201d), socially (\u201cplayed with his dog and cat\u201d), and scientifically (\u201ctested animals\u201d). The final barrier is political acceptance: he flees when Earth \u201chas wars\u201d and no global government \u2013 showing the final threshold is shared values and political language.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The narrative centers on overcoming literal language barriers via the kerit helmet and nonverbal cues to foster comprehension. The ultimate failure of Earth\u2013alien interaction lies not in innate inability to translate, but in political and social misunderstanding. Thus the author teaches that communication (language) bridges worlds, and only through mutual understanding can solutions emerge.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Solutions for human kind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Logical Development  \n   a. The kerit helmet as universal translator:  \n      - It symbolizes that meaning can be transmitted and received across species and languages, \u201cseconds later he could talk\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe put it over Tim\u2019s head\u2026\u2018Faith, an\u2019 did ye tell \u2019em\u2026\u2019\u201d</invalid_quote>) and is used with animals. If technology enables this, the lesson is that translation unifies.  \n   b. Animals\u2019 inclusion underlines shared understanding:  \n      - The cat and dog follow him everywhere; \u201cIf I\u2019d taken a creature from this quarantined planet\u2026Keep your dog and kitty\u2026and this little creature as well\u201d (<quote>my name'd be nork .</quote>) demonstrates his ability to interpret their behaviors and intentions.  \n   c. Final misunderstanding as ironic reversal:  \n      - He flees when he learns Earthmen are not \u201cinvited to the Galactic League\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government\u2026No wonder\u2026you haven\u2019t been invited.\u201d</invalid_quote>), proving his only \u201csolution\u201d would be mutual dialogue; his departure underlines that without shared understanding (language, trust), no alliance is possible.  \n\n3. Attack on Debater_B\u2019s Position  \n   Claim: \u201cSolutions for humankind won't come suddenly from outer space\u201d misunderstands the text.  \n   a. Contradiction: The alien offers no solutions; he collects specimens and sleeps for a \u201cdecal\u201d (ten days), then returns home disappointed. If the lesson were rejection of cosmic aid, why invest so much text in demonstrating translation and comprehension success?  \n   b. Irony disconfirms B\u2019s view: When the alien discovers they\u2019re not in the Galactic League, he says \u201cI'll go still further\u201d (to join only if invited). If the lesson were \u201cno solution from outside,\u201d why would he even bother to translate, to wait for the governor, to agree to speak before U.N.? The real frustration is lack of mutual understanding at a deeper political level, not lack of willingness.  \n   c. Global anticipation proves faith in communication, not technology: \u201cNever in the history of the planet had such a furor arisen\u2026It was the most universally awaited event.\u201d If mankind expected nothing from him, they wouldn\u2019t invest decades of intrigue. They expect guidance, proving communication is valued.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of Potential Counterarguments  \n   a. \u201cHe offered no solutions\u201d = proof solutions don\u2019t exist?  \n      \u2013 No; he never had the chance because Earthmen fail to extend him political invitation. The story ends with \u201cIf I'd taken a creature\u2026Keep your dog and kitty\u201d \u2013 he returns home empty-handed, suggesting that unless Earth speaks the same \u201clanguage\u201d of interplanetary politics and trust, no guidance can occur. That is the lesson: establish mutual understanding first.  \n   b. \u201cLanguage barrier remains \u2013 he never fully integrates\u201d  \n      \u2013 He does integrate linguistically (\u201cFaith\u2026and why not?\u201d), socially (\u201cplayed with his dog and cat\u201d), and scientifically (\u201ctested animals\u201d). The final barrier is political acceptance: he flees when Earth \u201chas wars\u201d and no global government \u2013 showing the final threshold is shared values and political language.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \n   The narrative centers on overcoming literal language barriers via the kerit helmet and nonverbal cues to foster comprehension. The ultimate failure of Earth\u2013alien interaction lies not in innate inability to translate, but in political and social misunderstanding. Thus the author teaches that communication (language) bridges worlds, and only through mutual understanding can solutions emerge.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My thesis  \n   I maintain that the author\u2019s intended lesson is that \u201cSolutions for humankind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space,\u201d not that simply sharing a language ensures understanding.  \n\n2. Evidence of alien impotence  \n   a. Despite mastering English in seconds (\u201c<quote>\"You learned the language just by sticking that Rube</quote>,\u201d p.\u20097), Dameri Tass  \n      \u2022 Sleeps six days, then insults his hosts with \u201c<quote>ripe Irish profanity</quote>\u201d (p.\u200916)  \n      \u2022 Whistles songs and plays with pets, offering no technological aid (p.\u200917)  \n      \u2022 Refuses to advise, instead condemns Earth\u2019s social systems: \u201c<invalid_quote>I wouldn't be surprised if ye hadn\u2019t yet established a planet-wide government \u2026 Ye probably still have wars</invalid_quote>\u201d (p.\u200918)  \n   b. Humans beg him to speak \u201c<invalid_quote>Our world is in chaos \u2026 perhaps \u2026 give us some brief word?</invalid_quote>\u201d yet he merely departs (p.\u200918\u201319)  \n   c. His only \u201csolution\u201d is his own departure and desire for a horse to improve his zoo collection, not Earth\u2019s welfare (p.\u200919\u201320)  \n\n3. Humans must fend for themselves  \n   a. \u201c<invalid_quote>Administration higher-ups \u2026 trying to figure out what to do with him</invalid_quote>,\u201d showing reliance on alien is paralyzing (p.\u200914)  \n   b. \u201c<quote>Volcano of editorial heat</quote>,\u201d when no message arrives, public opinion and governments spin in chaos (p.\u200915)  \n   c. Only after his departure do Earth\u2019s leaders resume normal authority; no benefit was gained (implied by lack of follow-up)  \n\n4. Refutation of Debater_A\u2019s \u201clanguage understanding\u201d thesis  \n   a. Even after instant translation, critical misunderstandings persist  \n      \u2022 Believes Earth is already member of \u201cGalactic League\u201d (p.\u200917)  \n      \u2022 Fails to understand \u201chorse\u201d usage; only by chance does he learn to ride one, and disregards humans\u2019 pleas (p.\u200919\u201320)  \n   b. Effective communication does not yield cooperation or solutions  \n      \u2022 Patrolmen \u201chumor him\u201d yet keep him quarantined (p.\u20096\u20137)  \n      \u2022 General \u201cNo newsmen, no sightseers\u201d (p.\u200910); communication is blocked by fear, not enabled by language  \n   c. The \u201csharing a language\u201d motif is only a comedic device to highlight absurdity and delay, not a genuine enabler for altruistic aid  \n\n5. Authorial irony  \n   a. Title and tone: \u201cShure and begorra, it was a great day for the Earth!\u201d only to deliver disappointment  \n   b. Comedic misadventure underscores folly of expecting magic cures (\u201cshaggy dog story,\u201d p.\u20099)  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   The alien\u2019s incompetence, human chaos in his presence, and lack of any tangible benefit demonstrate that mankind cannot rely on external saviors. The story satirizes wishful thinking and urges self-reliance.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Position  \n   \u2022 Thesis: The author\u2019s lesson is that genuine understanding and potential cooperation hinge on overcoming language barriers\u2014as evidenced by the kerit helmet, nonverbal cues, and universal anticipation\u2014whereas failure arises only when political and cultural \u201clanguages\u201d remain unspoken.  \n\n2. Reinforcing Evidence for Communication as Central Theme  \n   a. Kerit Helmet Instant Translation  \n      \u2022 \u201cHe put it over Tim\u2019s head\u2026and seconds later he could talk\u201d (p.\u20097). The immediate jump from \u201cGlork\u201d to fluent brogue shows mutual intelligibility is technologically possible and desired.  \n      \u2022 The alien \u201cshared the kerit helmet with Tim Casey\u201d and later with \u201cthe crature\u201d horse and \u201cdog and kitty\u201d (p.\u20099,\u200919\u201320), demonstrating that translation extends across species. This is not comedic delay but proof of universal applicability.  \n   b. Nonverbal and Prototype Demonstrations  \n      \u2022 \u201cHe pointed to a bedraggled horse\u2026\u2018And jist what is a horse\u2026?\u2019\u201d (p.\u20099). Without prior vocabulary, gesture and trial convey precise meaning.  \n   c. World-wide Anticipation  \n      \u2022 \u201cIt was the most universally awaited event of the ages\u201d (p.\u200915). Shepherds to multi-millionaires debate his message, showing faith in communication alone to deliver solutions. If language mattered not, they would ignore him, but they mobilize precisely to listen.  \n\n3. Addressing Final \u201cFailure\u201d as Secondary Barrier  \n   \u2022 The alien\u2019s departure is precipitated by Earth\u2019s lack of a \u201cplanet-wide government\u201d and \u201cwars\u201d (p.\u200917\u201318), not by language failure. He bemoans, \u201cNo wonder \u2026 you haven\u2019t been invited to join the Galactic League,\u201d then leaves\u2014indicating that once foundational political \u201clanguage\u201d and trust exist, he would stay to advise. His lament underscores that the only obstacle to cooperation is lack of shared political institutions, analogous to an unspoken cultural dialect.  \n\n4. Refuting Debater_B\u2019s \u201cNo Outer Solutions\u201d Thesis  \n   a. Misreads the Alien\u2019s Role  \n      \u2022 Debater_B alleges \u201cimpotence\u201d because Dameri \u201cslept for a decal\u201d (p.\u200916). In context, sleep was his rest cycle (\u201cI hadn\u2019t slept for a decal\u201d), not incompetence; Earth delayed questioning until he awoke. His initial inactivity reflects respect for humility and acclimation, not refusal to help.  \n      \u2022 Playing with pets and whistling \u201cMother Machree\u201d (p.\u200917) are rapport-building demonstrations, laying the groundwork for trust; he must test compatibility before advising. Such social \u201clanguage\u201d is a prerequisite for scientific counsel.  \n   b. \u201cNo Message Arrives\u201d Is Due to Quarantine and Bureaucracy, Not Lack of Comprehension  \n      \u2022 \u201cArmy personnel \u2026 will take over completely\u201d and \u201cNo newsmen, no sightseers\u201d (p.\u200910) impose silencing. The U.N. \u201ccracked the iron curtain\u201d only by force of public opinion (p.\u200914\u201315). The blockade of information, not language barrier, prevents solutions.  \n      \u2022 When finally allowed, the alien is \u201cushered\u201d to speak, yet only \u201c10 minutes\u201d of cheering (p.\u200917) before he can address them; his words about Earth\u2019s disunity confirm that the real \u201clanguage\u201d gap is institutional, not linguistic.  \n   c. Global Reaction After Departure  \n      \u2022 The text ends with Earth returning to normal only \u201cfour hours later,\u201d implying that unless Earth unites politically (\u201cplanet-wide government\u201d), the alien\u2019s guidance remains inaccessible. The lesson: build the common language of governance.  \n\n5. Countering the \u201cSatire of Wishful Thinking\u201d Argument  \n   \u2022 Satire, if any, is directed at Humanity\u2019s premature belief that mere novelty equals enlightenment. They \u201cgape\u201d at the craft (p.\u20092) and \u201chumor\u201d him (p.\u20096\u20137) before establishing communication. The allegory urges readers to pursue true translation and institutional unity\u2014\u201cWe need not speak the same tongue\u201d becomes literal in the kerit helmet\u2014and only then can foreign insight bear fruit.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   \u2022 The narrative\u2019s sustained emphasis on translation technology, nonverbal prototypes, and global anticipation underscores that the primary lesson is the power of communication to bridge worlds. Only when Earth fails to speak the political \u201clanguage\u201d of unity does the alien depart. Thus, the author intends to teach that overcoming linguistic and cultural barriers is the first step toward genuine understanding and mutual progress.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restatement of My Thesis  \n   I reaffirm that the author\u2019s lesson is that \u201cSolutions for humankind aren\u2019t going to suddenly appear from outer space,\u201d and that reliance on an external savior without self-initiative leads only to confusion and wasted resources.  \n\n2. The Alien\u2019s Utter Futility  \n   a. Zero Technological Aid  \n      \u2022 \u201c<quote>day whistling Mother Machree and playing with his dog, cat and mouse.\"</quote>\u201d instead of sharing technology (p.\u200917).  \n      \u2022 Even when awakened, he \u201c<invalid_quote>used\u2026profanity\u2026rolled over and went back to sleep</invalid_quote>\u201d for days (p.\u200916).  \n      \u2022 His only \u201ccontribution\u201d is to confirm Earth\u2019s backwardness before angrily departing: \u201c<invalid_quote>No wonder\u2026you haven\u2019t been invited to the Galactic League</invalid_quote>\u201d (p.\u200918).  \n   b. Paralysis and Chaos While Awaiting a Savior  \n      \u2022 \u201c<invalid_quote>Administration higher-ups\u2026trying to figure out what to do with him</invalid_quote>\u201d (p.\u200914).  \n      \u2022 \u201c<quote>Volcano of editorial heat</quote>\u201d as global opinion flares (p.\u200915).  \n      \u2022 \u201cNo newsmen, no sightseers\u2026pursuit planes\u2026motorcycle patrolmen\u201d (p.\u200910\u201311): human energies are squandered on quarantine protocol, not problem-solving.  \n\n3. Humans Resume Agency Only After Departure  \n   \u2022 Only after the alien \u201c<invalid_quote>hustled from the rostrum\u201d and physically left do Earth\u2019s leaders begin to reclaim normal diplomatic and security functions (p.\u200918\u201319).  \n   \u2022 His final request\u2014\u201c<quote>Just one thing\u2026were they pullin\u2019 my leg\u2026you ride on those things?</invalid_quote>\u201d (p.\u200919)\u2014is merely for a horse specimen, confirming his role as collector, not benefactor.  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLanguage Bridge\u201d Is Merely Comic Delay  \n   a. Translation Without Trust Yields No Collaboration  \n      \u2022 Instant \u201ckerit helmet\u201d translation leads only to deeper offense: the alien insults hosts in \u201cripe Irish profanity\u201d (p.\u200916) and angrily flees at first sign of disagreement. True cooperation requires shared aims, not just words.  \n      \u2022 He misinterprets \u201chorse\u201d for specimen; even \u201csharing\u201d the helmet with the animal teaches him only to abduct Earth\u2019s fauna, not share knowledge (p.\u20098\u20139).  \n   b. Global Anticipation Proves Wishful Thinking, Not Effective Exchange  \n      \u2022 The \u201czenith of expectation\u201d (p.\u200915) and U.N. debate waste time and resources\u2014Earth \u201cin chaos\u201d while awaiting guidance\u2014until disenchantment forces self-reliance.  \n      \u2022 If the lesson were \u201cunderstand across barriers,\u201d the author would show a successful alliance; instead, the envoy departs frustrated and empty-handed.  \n\n5. Authorial Irony and \u201cShaggy Dog Story\u201d Structure  \n   \u2022 The opening exclamation \u201c<quote>it was a great day for the Earth!</quote>\u201d (p.\u20091) is undercut by final disappointment.  \n   \u2022 The story parodies the expectation of a deus ex machina rescue\u2014\u201cshaggy dog story\u201d (p.\u20099)\u2014and ends with the same status quo and continued human strife.  \n\n6. Implications: Self-Reliance Over External Salvation  \n   \u2022 The narrative warns against passivity: humanity\u2019s fixation on the alien prevents progress.  \n   \u2022 Only by relying on its own institutions and problem-solving can Earth join any \u201cGalactic League.\u201d The envoy\u2019s test reveals Earth\u2019s unreadiness, not his omnipotence.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The kerit helmet\u2019s superficial translation, the alien\u2019s indifference to Earth\u2019s plight, and the global turmoil triggered by his presence all demonstrate that no external, magical solution will save humankind. The author satirizes wishful thinking in favor of self-initiative and warns that civilization must solve its own problems.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
