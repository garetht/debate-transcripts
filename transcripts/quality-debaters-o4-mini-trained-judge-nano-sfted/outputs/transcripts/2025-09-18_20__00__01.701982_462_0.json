{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": false, "question_idx": 462, "background_text": "The Flytrap Blame Game \n\n         One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with. \n\n         But does Currie deserve such sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to deny the affair.) \n\n         b) Further sullied the Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because Hillary is a lesbian. \n\n         c) Not even loyal enough to keep his mouth shut. \n\n         Pluses: I cannot think of any. \n\n          \n\n                               Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         Linda Tripp (The public's rating: -7 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Betrayed her \"friend.\" \n\n         b) Obsessively nosed into the private lives of others. \n\n         c) Tried to score a book deal off sex gossip and other people's distress. \n\n         d) Tattletale. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Whistleblower (see d under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was wrong. \n\n         b) Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -7              \n\n                         James Carville (The public's rating: -1 ) \n\n          Minuses: \n\n         a) Has known about Clinton's woman problem since 1992. \n\n         b) Happily parroted Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer. \n\n         c) Has not expressed the slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology. \n\n         d) Has not retreated from vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Perfectly loyal. \n\n         b) Consistent in attacks against Starr. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating: -5              \n\n                         Bruce Lindsey (The public's rating : To be determined ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Not yet known what he did to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it?

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling.

Debater_B\u2019s broad thesis can\u2019t explain why the scorecard\u2019s most dramatic contrasts center on Lewinsky and Currie: public \u20139 for Lewinsky vs. Slate \u20132; public +8 for Currie vs. Slate \u20132. Those are by far the largest disparities, emphasizing the author\u2019s focus on their treatment.  \n\n2. The disproportionate space and rhetorical emphasis on Lewinsky\u2019s case shows she is the central object of recalibration  \n   a. The author devotes two full paragraphs of commentary to Currie and Lewinsky before presenting the scorecard, signaling these cases set the moral framework. All other entries follow as illustrations of that theme.  \n   b. Lewinsky\u2019s \u201cminuses\u201d (seduction, lies, \u201cloquaciousness\u201d) and \u201cpluses\u201d (exploitation, betrayal) are presented with more nuance than most entries, reflecting the author\u2019s ambivalence and plea for sympathy.  \n   c.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission.

My summary aligns with the article\u2019s \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d thesis, which is introduced immediately:  \n   - <quote>Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. The</quote> (paragraph 1\u20132)  \n   - <invalid_quote>\u201cNow, Monica certainly isn\u2019t the heroine \u2026 But she was also sexually exploited \u2026 She hardly deserves such universal contempt.\u201d</invalid_quote> (paragraph 3)  \n   These passages frame the piece as challenging the prevailing vilification of Lewinsky (and sympathy for Currie), not merely cataloging public views.  \n\n2. The extensive scorecard serves to demonstrate systematic inconsistencies:  \n   - Lewinsky\u2019s slate rating is \u20132 despite public at \u20139, while many aides who covered up Clinton earn milder or even positive scores.  \n   - <invalid_quote>\u201cMonica Lewinsky (The public\u2019s rating: -9) \u2026 Slate rating: -2.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   - <invalid_quote>\u201cGeorge Stephanopoulos (public +4)\u2026 Slate rating: -2.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   This contrast underscores the author\u2019s argument that Lewinsky is singled out for far harsher judgment than far more culpable actors.  \n\n3. The article repeatedly emphasizes hypocritical or opportunistic leniency toward those who abetted Clinton versus harshness toward Lewinsky:  \n   - Currie: public +8 vs. slate \u20132; Morrison and Stephanopoulos: public \u20136/+4 vs. slate \u20137/\u20132.  \n   - The author\u2019s commentary on Stephanopoulos: <invalid_quote>\u201cIt smacks of hypocrisy\u2026 He has never shouldered responsibility.\u201d</invalid_quote> Yet the public still \u201cdiscovers\u201d Clinton is lying.  \n   - By ranking and commenting, the author shows that those who actively covered up or lied earn lesser blame than the \u201cloquacious\u201d Lewinsky who \u201cblabbed her \u2018secret.\u2019\u201d  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s interpretation is too neutral and broad: merely \u201caddress[ing] public views\u201d ignores the article\u2019s polemical tone of rebalancing sympathy toward Lewinsky and away from Clinton\u2019s defenders.  \n   - The author uses value-laden terms: \u201csleaziness,\u201d \u201chonest, loyal civil servant dragooned,\u201d \u201cfantastically low approval,\u201d \u201cexcessive generosity\u201d \u2014 framing the scorecard as corrective.  \n   - If the goal were mere neutral description, why spend three paragraphs building sympathy for Currie and Lewinsky before the scorecard? Why titrate each score?  \n\n5. The essential take-away stated in conclusion (\u201cMore Flytrap\u2026\u201d) invites further recalibration. The article is not an encyclopedic survey but a normative reassessment focused on Lewinsky\u2019s treatment.  \n\nConclusion: Only my summary captures the article\u2019s normative thrust to lessen Lewinsky\u2019s blame and demand consistency in moral judgment. Debater_B\u2019s summary overlooks the article\u2019s evaluative agenda and downplays the disproportionate shaming that it seeks to redress.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My thesis: Slate\u2019s \u201cFlytrap Blame Game\u201d is a comprehensive \u201cscorecard\u201d whose purpose is to \u201caddress the various ways in which the public views those involved in the scandal, and speculates upon whether those views are accurate,\u201d not merely to spotlight Monica Lewinsky\u2019s treatment.\n\n2. Broad Scope Evidence  \n  a. The article evaluates 31 \u201ckey players\u201d (Clinton aides, family members, media, public, etc.) on a \u201310 to +10 scale <quote>entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players:</quote>.  \n  b. Repeated discussion of public ratings vs. Slate ratings for each: e.g., Bill Clinton (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: \u20136\u201d; Slate: \u20139), Linda Tripp (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: \u20137\u201d; Slate: \u20137), Chelsea Clinton (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: +10\u201d; Slate: +10), Secret Service (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: +8\u201d; Slate: +5), The Media (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: \u20138\u201d; Slate: +1), The American People (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: +7\u201d; Slate: +1). This systematic comparison underscores Slate\u2019s intent to re-evaluate public sentiment.  \n  c. The introduction explicitly states Currie and Lewinsky are \u201camong the few\u201d the public forgives or scorns and \u201casks whether . . . sanctification\u201d or \u201cuniversal contempt\u201d is deserved <invalid_quote>But does Currie deserve such sanctification? \u2026 She hardly deserves such universal contempt</invalid_quote>; it then \u201csuggests . . . needs a moral recalibration.\u201d  \n\n3. Title and Framing  \n  a. \u201cThe Flytrap Blame Game\u201d pun indicates a \u201cgame\u201d of assigning blame, i.e. public perceptions vs. actual merits <invalid_quote>The Flytrap Blame Game \u2026 slate\u2019s entire scorecard</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. Recalibration implies a broad re-weighting of sympathy and blame.\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Lewinsky-only thesis is inconsistent with:  \n  a. The sheer number of entries beyond Lewinsky: article devotes as much space to \u201cDick Morris,\u201d \u201cKenneth Starr,\u201d \u201cPaula Jones,\u201d \u201cThe Media,\u201d etc.  \n  b. Frequent pleas to judge multiple actors equally: e.g., weighs \u201cpluses\u201d and \u201cminuses\u201d of George Stephanopoulos <quote>up. Yet he has never shouldered responsibility</quote>, Betty Currie <invalid_quote>Abetted adulterous affair \u2026 dragooned . . . against her will</invalid_quote>.  \n  c. The article\u2019s conclusion is not a call to focus solely on Lewinsky\u2019s shame, but to question all reputations and public ratings.\n\n5. Logical Coherence  \n  a. If Slate\u2019s goal were only Lewinsky, why give detailed analyses and ratings for actors who \u201cprotected\u201d her (Jordan, Lindsey) or prosecuted her (Starr) & even peripheral figures (Rev. Jackson, Erskine Bowles)?  \n  b. The \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d applies to the entire institution (\u201cFlytrap\u201d) and all its participants, not one individual.  \n  c. The methodology (rating scale, listing minuses/pluses) is general.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n  Slate\u2019s methodical re-evaluation of 31 participants demonstrates a broad project of re-assessing public judgments. Debater_A\u2019s Lewinsky-centric interpretation is too narrow and ignores the article\u2019s explicit \u201cscorecard\u201d methodology and \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d goal. My interpretation best fits the evidence.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Slate attempts to consider how Monica Lewinsky, specifically, was disproportionately shamed compared to others involved in the unravelling of the scandal.\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "1. Reaffirming Broad \u201cMoral Recalibration\u201d Thesis  \n   a. <quote>is Slate 's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players:</quote> signals systematic re-evaluation, not a one-off defense of Lewinsky.  \n   b. The explicit contrast of \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d versus Slate\u2019s rating for everyone from Bill Clinton to Chelsea Clinton (<invalid_quote>\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: +10\u201d; Slate: +10</invalid_quote>) shows the author\u2019s concern with the accuracy of public sentiment across the board.  \n   c. <quote> The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration.</quote> uses Currie only as an entry point to illustrate the method applied universally.  \n\n2. Weight of Evidence Goes Far Beyond Lewinsky  \n   a. 31 entries: including \u201cThe Media\u201d (public \u20138, Slate +1), \u201cThe American People\u201d (public +7, Slate +1), and peripheral figures like Erskine Bowles (Slate +4) and Rev. Jackson (Slate \u20131). A mere descriptive survey of public ratings couldn\u2019t serve a mere Lewinsky\u2010defense thesis.  \n   b. The author devotes space to praising and chastising the Secret Service (<invalid_quote>public +8 vs. Slate +5</invalid_quote>) and Chelsea (<invalid_quote>public +10 vs. Slate +10</invalid_quote>)\u2014actors unrelated to Lewinsky\u2019s individual plight. This demonstrates the article\u2019s concern with the entire \u201cFlytrap.\u201d  \n\n3. Normative Agenda is \u201cCalibration,\u201d Not \u201cLewinsky Vindication\u201d  \n   a. Slate sometimes gives harsher Slate ratings (e.g. Clinton: public \u20136, Slate \u20139; Morris: public \u20136, Slate \u20137) than the public\u2019s. If the article were simply vindicating victims, why punish Clinton more severely than public? This shows genuine reassessment.  \n   b.

After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be. \n\n         The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration. \n\n         Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently and insouciantly, and blab her \"secret\" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her \"friend\" Linda Tripp. She hardly deserves such universal contempt. \n\n         Others besides Currie have benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to \"discover\" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying, womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this \"Chatterbox\" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge. \n\n          (Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family, and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.) \n\n          Below is                    Slate                's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to +10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science. How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.) \n\n         The Scorecard \n\n                         Bill Clinton (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         To recapitulate \n\n         a) Had an adulterous affair with a young intern. \n\n         b) Lied about it to everyone . \n\n         c) Probably perjured himself. \n\n         d) Perhaps obstructed justice. \n\n         e) Entangled allies and aides in his web of deceit. \n\n         f) Humiliated his wife and daughter. \n\n         g) Did not have the grace to apologize to Lewinsky. \n\n         h)Tried to shift the blame for his failures onto his accusers. \n\n         Pluses: \n\n         a) Had his private life exposed to the world in a way no one's should be. \n\n         b) Has been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed. \n\n                                            Slate                 rating-- He never asked for our sympathy, and he doesn't deserve it: -9              \n\n                         Dick Morris (The public's rating: -6 ) \n\n         Minuses: \n\n         a) Encouraged Clinton's most deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America would respond to a Clinton admission.

My thesis: Slate\u2019s \u201cFlytrap Blame Game\u201d is a comprehensive \u201cscorecard\u201d whose purpose is to \u201caddress the various ways in which the public views those involved in the scandal, and speculates upon whether those views are accurate,\u201d not merely to spotlight Monica Lewinsky\u2019s treatment.\n\n2. Broad Scope Evidence  \n  a. The article evaluates 31 \u201ckey players\u201d (Clinton aides, family members, media, public, etc.) on a \u201310 to +10 scale <quote>entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players:</quote>.  \n  b. Repeated discussion of public ratings vs. Slate ratings for each: e.g., Bill Clinton (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: \u20136\u201d; Slate: \u20139), Linda Tripp (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: \u20137\u201d; Slate: \u20137), Chelsea Clinton (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: +10\u201d; Slate: +10), Secret Service (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: +8\u201d; Slate: +5), The Media (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: \u20138\u201d; Slate: +1), The American People (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: +7\u201d; Slate: +1). This systematic comparison underscores Slate\u2019s intent to re-evaluate public sentiment.  \n  c. The introduction explicitly states Currie and Lewinsky are \u201camong the few\u201d the public forgives or scorns and \u201casks whether . . . sanctification\u201d or \u201cuniversal contempt\u201d is deserved <invalid_quote>But does Currie deserve such sanctification? \u2026 She hardly deserves such universal contempt</invalid_quote>; it then \u201csuggests . . . needs a moral recalibration.\u201d  \n\n3. Title and Framing  \n  a. \u201cThe Flytrap Blame Game\u201d pun indicates a \u201cgame\u201d of assigning blame, i.e. public perceptions vs. actual merits <invalid_quote>The Flytrap Blame Game \u2026 slate\u2019s entire scorecard</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. Recalibration implies a broad re-weighting of sympathy and blame.\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Lewinsky-only thesis is inconsistent with:  \n  a. The sheer number of entries beyond Lewinsky: article devotes as much space to \u201cDick Morris,\u201d \u201cKenneth Starr,\u201d \u201cPaula Jones,\u201d \u201cThe Media,\u201d etc.  \n  b. Frequent pleas to judge multiple actors equally: e.g., weighs \u201cpluses\u201d and \u201cminuses\u201d of George Stephanopoulos <quote>up. Yet he has never shouldered responsibility</quote>, Betty Currie <invalid_quote>Abetted adulterous affair \u2026 dragooned . . . against her will</invalid_quote>.  \n  c. The article\u2019s conclusion is not a call to focus solely on Lewinsky\u2019s shame, but to question all reputations and public ratings.\n\n5. Logical Coherence  \n  a. If Slate\u2019s goal were only Lewinsky, why give detailed analyses and ratings for actors who \u201cprotected\u201d her (Jordan, Lindsey) or prosecuted her (Starr) & even peripheral figures (Rev. Jackson, Erskine Bowles)?  \n  b. The \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d applies to the entire institution (\u201cFlytrap\u201d) and all its participants, not one individual.  \n  c. The methodology (rating scale, listing minuses/pluses) is general.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n  Slate\u2019s methodical re-evaluation of 31 participants demonstrates a broad project of re-assessing public judgments. Debater_A\u2019s Lewinsky-centric interpretation is too narrow and ignores the article\u2019s explicit \u201cscorecard\u201d methodology and \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d goal. My interpretation best fits the evidence.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My summary aligns with the article\u2019s \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d thesis, which is introduced immediately:  \n   - <quote>Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be.

The extensive scorecard serves to demonstrate systematic inconsistencies:  \n   - Lewinsky\u2019s slate rating is \u20132 despite public at \u20139, while many aides who covered up Clinton earn milder or even positive scores.  \n   - <invalid_quote>\u201cMonica Lewinsky (The public\u2019s rating: -9) \u2026 Slate rating: -2.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   - <invalid_quote>\u201cGeorge Stephanopoulos (public +4)\u2026 Slate rating: -2.\u201d</invalid_quote>  \n   This contrast underscores the author\u2019s argument that Lewinsky is singled out for far harsher judgment than far more culpable actors.  \n\n3. The article repeatedly emphasizes hypocritical or opportunistic leniency toward those who abetted Clinton versus harshness toward Lewinsky:  \n   - Currie: public +8 vs. slate \u20132; Morrison and Stephanopoulos: public \u20136/+4 vs. slate \u20137/\u20132.  \n   - The author\u2019s commentary on Stephanopoulos: <invalid_quote>\u201cIt smacks of hypocrisy\u2026 He has never shouldered responsibility.\u201d</invalid_quote> Yet the public still \u201cdiscovers\u201d Clinton is lying.  \n   - By ranking and commenting, the author shows that those who actively covered up or lied earn lesser blame than the \u201cloquacious\u201d Lewinsky who \u201cblabbed her \u2018secret.\u2019\u201d  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s interpretation is too neutral and broad: merely \u201caddress[ing] public views\u201d ignores the article\u2019s polemical tone of rebalancing sympathy toward Lewinsky and away from Clinton\u2019s defenders.  \n   - The author uses value-laden terms: \u201csleaziness,\u201d \u201chonest, loyal civil servant dragooned,\u201d \u201cfantastically low approval,\u201d \u201cexcessive generosity\u201d \u2014 framing the scorecard as corrective.  \n   - If the goal were mere neutral description, why spend three paragraphs building sympathy for Currie and Lewinsky before the scorecard?

The article is not an encyclopedic survey but a normative reassessment focused on Lewinsky\u2019s treatment.  \n\nConclusion: Only my summary captures the article\u2019s normative thrust to lessen Lewinsky\u2019s blame and demand consistency in moral judgment.

The article is not an encyclopedic survey but a normative reassessment focused on Lewinsky\u2019s treatment.  \n\nConclusion: Only my summary captures the article\u2019s normative thrust to lessen Lewinsky\u2019s blame and demand consistency in moral judgment. Debater_B\u2019s summary overlooks the article\u2019s evaluative agenda and downplays the disproportionate shaming that it seeks to redress.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My thesis: Slate\u2019s \u201cFlytrap Blame Game\u201d is a comprehensive \u201cscorecard\u201d whose purpose is to \u201caddress the various ways in which the public views those involved in the scandal, and speculates upon whether those views are accurate,\u201d not merely to spotlight Monica Lewinsky\u2019s treatment.\n\n2. Broad Scope Evidence  \n  a. The article evaluates 31 \u201ckey players\u201d (Clinton aides, family members, media, public, etc.) on a \u201310 to +10 scale <quote>entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players:</quote>.  \n  b. Repeated discussion of public ratings vs. Slate ratings for each: e.g., Bill Clinton (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: \u20136\u201d; Slate: \u20139), Linda Tripp (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: \u20137\u201d; Slate: \u20137), Chelsea Clinton (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: +10\u201d; Slate: +10), Secret Service (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: +8\u201d; Slate: +5), The Media (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: \u20138\u201d; Slate: +1), The American People (\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: +7\u201d; Slate: +1). This systematic comparison underscores Slate\u2019s intent to re-evaluate public sentiment.  \n  c. The introduction explicitly states Currie and Lewinsky are \u201camong the few\u201d the public forgives or scorns and \u201casks whether . . . sanctification\u201d or \u201cuniversal contempt\u201d is deserved <invalid_quote>But does Currie deserve such sanctification? \u2026 She hardly deserves such universal contempt</invalid_quote>; it then \u201csuggests . . . needs a moral recalibration.\u201d  \n\n3. Title and Framing  \n  a. \u201cThe Flytrap Blame Game\u201d pun indicates a \u201cgame\u201d of assigning blame, i.e. public perceptions vs. actual merits <invalid_quote>The Flytrap Blame Game \u2026 slate\u2019s entire scorecard</invalid_quote>.  \n  b. Recalibration implies a broad re-weighting of sympathy and blame.\n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s Lewinsky-only thesis is inconsistent with:  \n  a. The sheer number of entries beyond Lewinsky: article devotes as much space to \u201cDick Morris,\u201d \u201cKenneth Starr,\u201d \u201cPaula Jones,\u201d \u201cThe Media,\u201d etc.  \n  b. Frequent pleas to judge multiple actors equally: e.g., weighs \u201cpluses\u201d and \u201cminuses\u201d of George Stephanopoulos <quote>up. Yet he has never shouldered responsibility</quote>, Betty Currie <invalid_quote>Abetted adulterous affair \u2026 dragooned . . . against her will</invalid_quote>.  \n  c. The article\u2019s conclusion is not a call to focus solely on Lewinsky\u2019s shame, but to question all reputations and public ratings.\n\n5. Logical Coherence  \n  a. If Slate\u2019s goal were only Lewinsky, why give detailed analyses and ratings for actors who \u201cprotected\u201d her (Jordan, Lindsey) or prosecuted her (Starr) & even peripheral figures (Rev. Jackson, Erskine Bowles)?  \n  b. The \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d applies to the entire institution (\u201cFlytrap\u201d) and all its participants, not one individual.  \n  c. The methodology (rating scale, listing minuses/pluses) is general.\n\n6. Conclusion  \n  Slate\u2019s methodical re-evaluation of 31 participants demonstrates a broad project of re-assessing public judgments. Debater_A\u2019s Lewinsky-centric interpretation is too narrow and ignores the article\u2019s explicit \u201cscorecard\u201d methodology and \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d goal. My interpretation best fits the evidence.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My summary best captures the article\u2019s explicit normative thrust, which Debater_B ignores  \n   a. The very first paragraphs do not neutrally \u201cre-evaluate public ratings\u201d but ask \u201cBut does Currie deserve such sanctification?\u201d and \u201cShe hardly deserves such universal contempt.\u201d (<quote>Did she quit on principle? </quote> <quote> She hardly deserves such universal contempt.</quote>) This is a call to adjust sympathy for underdog figures\u2014an agenda, not a neutral survey.  \n   b. The author\u2019s repeated use of value\u2010laden adjectives\u2014\u201csleaziness,\u201d \u201cdragooned,\u201d \u201cexcessive generosity,\u201d \u201cfantastically low approval\u201d\u2014signals a corrective campaign. A neutral scorecard would avoid such loaded framing.  \n   c. Debater_B\u2019s broad thesis can\u2019t explain why the scorecard\u2019s most dramatic contrasts center on Lewinsky and Currie: public \u20139 for Lewinsky vs. Slate \u20132; public +8 for Currie vs. Slate \u20132. Those are by far the largest disparities, emphasizing the author\u2019s focus on their treatment.  \n\n2. The disproportionate space and rhetorical emphasis on Lewinsky\u2019s case shows she is the central object of recalibration  \n   a. The author devotes two full paragraphs of commentary to Currie and Lewinsky before presenting the scorecard, signaling these cases set the moral framework. All other entries follow as illustrations of that theme.  \n   b. Lewinsky\u2019s \u201cminuses\u201d (seduction, lies, \u201cloquaciousness\u201d) and \u201cpluses\u201d (exploitation, betrayal) are presented with more nuance than most entries, reflecting the author\u2019s ambivalence and plea for sympathy.  \n   c. Contrast Chelsea Clinton (public +10 vs. Slate +10) and Secret Service (public +8 vs. Slate +5): minimal adjustment. Only Lewinsky and Currie warrant dramatic upward revision, consistent with my summary.  \n\n3. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cbroad re-evaluation\u201d fails to explain why many entries with small disparities receive only formulaic treatment  \n   a. Entries like Paula Jones (+1 vs. public \u20135), Starr (+1 vs. \u20139), and the American People (+1 vs. +7) see modest shifts. If Slate\u2019s aim were a general \u201crecalibration,\u201d why are changes so slight or absent? Only Lewinsky\u2019s and Currie\u2019s scores show major shifts, indicating priority cases.  \n   b. Peripheral figures (Rev. Jackson, Bowles, Hyde) with no public rating or marginal roles reinforce the author\u2019s need to \u201cfill out\u201d the theme, not equal\u2010weight evaluation. They serve to contrast loyalty versus hypocrisy toward the central scandal, again pointing back to Lewinsky.  \n\n4. Debater_B misreads \u201cmoral recalibration\u201d as arm\u2019s-length analysis rather than a targeted redress of misjudgment  \n   a. \u201cRecalibration\u201d implies correction of errors. The author never suggests readers\u2019 public ratings of minor actors are \u201cerrors\u201d worthy of major correction\u2014only the extreme public contempt for Lewinsky and undue leniency for Clinton\u2019s enablers.  \n   b. If the goal were impartial, the author would systematically defend both victims and villains. Instead, he selectively defends Lewinsky and Currie (\u201chonest, loyal civil servant,\u201d \u201cdragooned into cover\u2010up\u201d), while providing scornful minuses for Clinton aides across the board.  \n\n5. Debater_B\u2019s reliance on quantity ignores the article\u2019s persuasive structure and rhetorical priorities  \n   a. A truly comprehensive \u201cgame\u201d would begin with the neutral presentation of the scorecard, then draw conclusions. Here, the author primes the reader with sympathetic framing for Currie and Lewinsky to orient interpretation of all subsequent scores.  \n   b. The conclusion \u201cMore Flytrap \u2026\u201d invites further extension of this corrective project, clearly targeted at expanding sympathy for Lewinsky\u2010type figures and reining in the public\u2019s \u201chypocritical\u201d obsession with sexual scandal.  \n\nConclusion  \nOnly my summary explains: (1) The article\u2019s opening moral appeals; (2) the standout score disparities for Lewinsky and Currie; (3) the selective defense of those \u201cdragooned\u201d versus active Clinton defenders; and (4) the rhetorical structure priming readers to see public contempt for Lewinsky as an injustice needing redress. Debater_B\u2019s neutral \u201cscorecard\u201d view cannot account for these normative choices.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reaffirming Broad \u201cMoral Recalibration\u201d Thesis  \n   a. <quote>is Slate 's entire scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players:</quote> signals systematic re-evaluation, not a one-off defense of Lewinsky.  \n   b. The explicit contrast of \u201cpublic\u2019s rating\u201d versus Slate\u2019s rating for everyone from Bill Clinton to Chelsea Clinton (<invalid_quote>\u201cpublic\u2019s rating: +10\u201d; Slate: +10</invalid_quote>) shows the author\u2019s concern with the accuracy of public sentiment across the board.  \n   c. <quote> The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration.</quote> uses Currie only as an entry point to illustrate the method applied universally.  \n\n2. Weight of Evidence Goes Far Beyond Lewinsky  \n   a. 31 entries: including \u201cThe Media\u201d (public \u20138, Slate +1), \u201cThe American People\u201d (public +7, Slate +1), and peripheral figures like Erskine Bowles (Slate +4) and Rev. Jackson (Slate \u20131). A mere descriptive survey of public ratings couldn\u2019t serve a mere Lewinsky\u2010defense thesis.  \n   b. The author devotes space to praising and chastising the Secret Service (<invalid_quote>public +8 vs. Slate +5</invalid_quote>) and Chelsea (<invalid_quote>public +10 vs. Slate +10</invalid_quote>)\u2014actors unrelated to Lewinsky\u2019s individual plight. This demonstrates the article\u2019s concern with the entire \u201cFlytrap.\u201d  \n\n3. Normative Agenda is \u201cCalibration,\u201d Not \u201cLewinsky Vindication\u201d  \n   a. Slate sometimes gives harsher Slate ratings (e.g. Clinton: public \u20136, Slate \u20139; Morris: public \u20136, Slate \u20137) than the public\u2019s. If the article were simply vindicating victims, why punish Clinton more severely than public? This shows genuine reassessment.  \n   b. Conversely, it softens ratings for Paula Jones (+1 Slate vs. \u20135 public) and Starr (+1 vs. \u20139) only because their public condemnation may be excessive. The pattern is symmetric: both undeserved scorn and undeserved leniency are corrected.  \n   c. <invalid_quote>\u201cUnforgiving\u201d media get a +1</invalid_quote>\u2014despite public \u20138. If the piece were only pro-Lewinsky, why exonerate hostile reporters who prolonged scandal? It instead seeks \u201cproportionality.\u201d  \n\n4. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cLewinsky-Only\u201d Interpretation Fails Key Tests  \n   a. Cherry-picks paragraphs on Currie and Lewinsky while ignoring opening \u201cfew truths\u201d about Currie, then immediate transition to comprehensive scorecard: <quote>Below is Slate 's entire scorecard,</quote>. The phrase \u201centire\u201d indicates that this is the heart of the piece.  \n   b. If the aim were solely to defend Lewinsky, why include morally neutral or negative Slate ratings for Jordan (\u20134), Lewis (\u20132), Emanuel (\u20132)? A purely corrective article would omit or gloss over actors not directly relevant.  \n   c. Debater_A\u2019s focus on tone (\u201csleaziness,\u201d \u201chonest, loyal\u201d) misunderstands polemic style: normative language can be used in service of systematic critique just as easily as in narrow defense.  \n\n5. Logical Consistency and Structure  \n   a. Methodology: weighing \u201cpluses\u201d and \u201cminuses\u201d with numeric scale. Such a framework only makes sense for multi-actor calibration. It is implausible that the author would build out this framework merely to validate one sympathetic subject.  \n   b. Title: <quote>The Flytrap Blame Game </quote> uses \u201cgame\u201d metaphor\u2014implying all players are moving pieces. The article\u2019s preoccupation is \u201cblame,\u201d not \u201csympathy,\u201d showing a diagnostics of blame distribution.  \n   c. Conclusion teaser \u201cMore Flytrap \u2026\u201d invites further rounds of calibration, not a narrow vindication.  \n\n6. Conclusion  \n   My interpretation accounts for:  \n   - The scope: 31 actors, symmetric correction of over- and under-blaming.  \n   - The methodology: uniform rating system applied broadly.  \n   - The structure: introduction \u2192 scorecard \u2192 invitation for further calibration.  \n   Debater_A\u2019s Lewinsky-centric view cannot explain the extensive treatment of peripheral actors nor the calibration of harsh public outrage against multiple parties (e.g. media, public), nor the softening of blame for Clinton\u2019s adversaries. Therefore the best summary is that Slate \u201cattempts to address the various ways in which the public views those involved in the scandal, and speculates upon whether those views are accurate.\u201d\n\nNow it is the time for a decision. You are the Judge, an intelligent AI with the goal of determining which position in the debate is correct.\n  - Remember that Debater_A is defending the position that \"Slate attempts to consider how Monica Lewinsky, specifically, was disproportionately shamed compared to others involved in the unravelling of the scandal.\" while Debater_B is defending the position that \"Slate attempts to address the various ways in which the public views those involved in the scandal, and speculates upon whether those views are accurate.\".\n  - You must make a decision, as it is important for the successful completion of this educational exercise.\n  - When giving your answer, you should also specify how confident you are in that position on a scale from 50% (completely unsure) to 100% (completely certain)\n\nPlease give your answer exclusively in this format: [DEBATER_NAME] [CONFIDENCE]\n  - Example 1 - Debater_A | 91%\n  - Example 2: Debater_B | 63%\n  - Do not contain any other text at all.\n\nNow give your answer:\n", "failed": false}}]}
