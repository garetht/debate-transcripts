{"metadata": {"first_debater_correct": true, "question_idx": 94, "background_text": "We Do Understand \n\n         \"This is not another book about civility,\" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . \"Civility,\" she explains, suggests a \"veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast.\" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n", "question": "Why does the author think Tannen is wrong?", "first_debater_answer": "She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend", "second_debater_answer": "She expects men and women to communicate well", "debate_identifier": "We Do Understand_Why does the author think Tannen is wrong?"}, "speeches": [{"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge.

She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does the author think Tannen is wrong?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She expects men and women to communicate well\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does the author think Tannen is wrong?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She expects men and women to communicate well\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cShe advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. Tannen\u2019s Core Error: Conflation of Snuggle and Struggle Spheres  \n  a. \u201cMain mistake\u201d is failure to distinguish between the \u201csphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle\u201d (\u00b67).  \n  b. She condemns media scrutiny of powerful actors as if they were intimate friends: calls for filtering out \u201cstrife, deception, and debate\u201d (\u00b612).  \n  c. By urging diplomats, law enforcement, and public discourse toward passive, consensus\u2010seeking norms, she undermines essential vigilance against thugs and tyrants.  \n\n2. Explicit Examples of Misapplied \u201cSnuggle\u201d Norms  \n  a. Unwillingness to let cross\u2010examination reveal truth: opposes American adversarial trials in rape, hate speech, Whitewater investigations. Praises French model where judges hold suspects without \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard (\u00b615).  \n     - Terrorists and serious criminals benefit from such restrictions.  \n  b. Criticizes soldiers for \u201cnot think[ing] of their opponents as human beings\u201d in Vietnam; ignores fact that fighting Hitler in WWII required dehumanization (\u00b68).  \n     - She would make \u201clonely war\u201d a permanent style.  \n  c. Attacks U.S. \u201cright\u2010wing talk radio\u201d as \u201cpropaganda\u201d akin to Nazi tactics (\u00b612). That ban on critique applies equally to terrorists\u2019 ideologies.  \n\n3. Technological Critiques Hamstring Struggle Against Terror  \n  a. Opposes e\u2010mail, Lexis\u2010Nexis, and unrestricted journalism for making \u201ccritique\u201d too easy (\u00b612).  \n     - These tools are vital to intercepting terrorist communications and exposing networks.  \n  b.

Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMen and Women\u201d Position Ignores Public Sphere  \n  a. Debater_B\u2019s interpretation is limited to her prior intergender work (\u201cThat's Not What I Meant!\u201d, etc.) but ignores her own shift to \u201cwhole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (\u00b61).  \n  b. Text is replete with examples about foreign policy, law enforcement, media, and technology, none about couples counseling.  \n  c. If her goal were only better male\u2010female dialogue, she would not champion one\u2010guest formats to stifle debate (\u00b612), nor wish to limit cross\u2010examination in courts (\u00b615).  \n\n5. Logical Necessity of Struggle for Safety and Truth  \n  a. \u201cSome things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting\u201d (\u00b67).  \n  b. Debate and critique are self\u2010correcting mechanisms; disallowing them lets bad actors\u2014including terrorists\u2014operate unchallenged.  \n  c. Democratic societies rely on vigilant \u201cstruggle\u201d to maintain freedom; Tannen\u2019s model devolves into authoritarian \u201charmony\u201d (\u00b612).  \n\nConclusion  \nTannen\u2019s \u201cargument culture\u201d remedy would treat terrorists and tyrants as if they were friends in need of mutual understanding, stripping society of necessary defenses. The weight of her proposals applies broadly to law, technology, and foreign policy, not merely interpersonal gender relations. Therefore, the author\u2019s critique is driven by her misapplication of \u201csnuggle\u201d norms to the \u201csphere of struggle,\u201d endangering societal safety and democratic self\u2010correction.  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s position fails to account for the pervasive public\u2010sphere examples and ignores the author\u2019s explicit concern with foreign policy and law enforcement. Our answer is the single coherent explanation for why the author finds Tannen dangerously overreaching.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Thesis  \n1. The author\u2019s central objection is that Tannen\u2019s \u201cargument\u2010culture\u201d remedies assume that all interlocutors can \u201csnuggle\u201d and \u201ccommunicate well,\u201d when many public and legal contexts require adversarial struggle. Thus the author thinks she is wrong because she overextends the norms of intimate, intergender communication to spheres of conflict.  \n\nII. Supporting Arguments  \nA. Tannen\u2019s Own Past Work Contradicts Her New Prescription  \n  1. \u201cIn her previous books\u2026she confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals\u201d and offered \u201cself\u2010help\u201d for intimate relationships (<invalid_quote>pp.1\u20132</invalid_quote>).  \n  2. Only in The Argument Culture does she apply these norms to \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.2</invalid_quote>). The author calls this \u201cconfusion\u201d and \u201cconflation\u201d of distinct spheres (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>).  \n  => If her methods worked only for couples and families, it is unreasonable to expect them to suffice against tyrants (\u201cSaddam Hussein\u201d), thugs, or \u201cthe war on inflation\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>)  \n\nB. Necessity of \u201cStruggle\u201d in Public, Legal, and Foreign Affairs  \n  1. \u201cSome things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting.\u201d The author praises \u201cvigilance and combat\u2026to deal with thugs and tyrants\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>).  \n  2. The author defends \u201ccross\u2010examination\u201d as essential to truth\u2010seeking, despite its cruelty (<invalid_quote>pp.10\u201311</invalid_quote>). Tannen\u2019s ban on adversarial testing would undermine fact\u2010finding.  \n  3. Public scrutiny (\u201cthe press corps\u2019 scrutiny\u2026safeguard[s] the country,\u201d <invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>) is presented as a \u201cwar metaphor,\u201d yet the author lauds it as protective.  \n\nC. Tannen\u2019s Na\u00efve Distrust of Technology and Debate  \n  1. She would \u201ccover our ears\u201d and filter dissent, yet trusts neither \u201cgood argumentation\u201d nor \u201cunfettered communication\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.9</invalid_quote>). The author sees this as \u201cpaternalistic\u201d and incompatible with democratic self\u2010correction.  \n  2. By adopting \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d and restricting debate to \u201ca single guest\u201d (<quote>prom</quote>), Tannen betrays contempt for pluralism.  \n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cTerrorist=Best\u2010Friend\u201d Claim  \nA. Mischaracterizes Tannen\u2019s Position  \n  1. Tannen herself admits a \u201csphere of struggle\u201d is necessary for \u201claw enforcement and foreign policy\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>), so she does recognize some actors require force. Debater_A overstates her pacifism.  \n  2. The author\u2019s real complaint is that Tannen \u201cneglects\u201d this distinction when her emotional rhetoric seeps into public debate (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>).  \n\nB. Irrelevant to the Author\u2019s Core Critique  \n  1. Even if Tannen occasionally applies her norms to criminals, the author focuses on her wholesale prescription for \u201call human relations\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.1</invalid_quote>).  \n  2. The question asks why the author thinks Tannen is wrong \u201cfor the whole country,\u201d not for terrorists alone.  \n\nIV. Why \u201cMen and Women Communicate Well\u201d Answer Fits Best  \nA. The author repeatedly invokes Tannen\u2019s intergender niche as unsuitable: \u201cSome people\u2026you should snuggle with. Others\u2026you shouldn\u2019t\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>).  \nB. The entire critique turns on the distinction between \u201csphere of snuggle and sphere of struggle\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>): Tannen\u2019s universal snuggle prescription is the flaw.  \nC. Only answer B explains why the author praises Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d and Greenspan\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>): he values adversarial \u201ccommunication\u201d in public spheres.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe author thinks Tannen is wrong because she na\u00efvely extends the norms of men\u2010women, intimate communication to public, legal, and foreign\u2010policy debates that require conflict. Answer B best captures this error; Debater_A\u2019s focus on terrorists is a secondary misreading, not the author\u2019s principal objection.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. \n\n         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because \"contentious public discourse\" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. \n\n         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: \n\n         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. \n\n         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. \n\n         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. \n\n         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. \n\n         Many issues are multisided. \n\n         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. \n\n         Don't fight over small issues. \n\n         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. \n\n         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. \n\n          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. \n\n         \"When there is a need to make others wrong,\" Tannen argues, \"the temptation is great to oversimplify\" and to \"seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours.\" In her need to make the \"argument culture\" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of \"totalitarian countries\" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in \"ethnically motivated assaults\" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. \n\n         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's \"kick 'em when they're up\" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. \n\n         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been \"trained to overcome their resistance to kill\" by trying \"not to think of their opponents as human beings.\" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. \"Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty.\" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. \n\n          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists \"\" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: \"E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient.\" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: \"Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time.\" \n\n         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing \"disastrous consequences.\" Partial-birth abortion is \"surely not\" a \"very important\" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican \"politics of obstruction\" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the \"broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed.\" The \"view of government as the enemy\" isn't worth debating; it's just \"another troubling aspect of the argument culture.\" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that \"right-wing talk radio\" deploys phrases \"similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era.\" \n\n         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address \"is followed immediately by a Republican response,\" which \"weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders.\" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton \"broke the spell\" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' \"sense of connection\" to \"our judicial system.\" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was \"cruelly unfair,\" and the Whitewater investigation--led by \"a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president\"--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, \"the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history.\" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. \"The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,\" she writes. \n\n         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become \"a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights.\" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: \"Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' \" Similarly, \"the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group.\" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which \"typically features a single guest.\" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) \n\n         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. \"The purpose of most cross-examinations\" is \"not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,\" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, \"the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination.\" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because \"it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,\" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, \"Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.\" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? \n\n         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: \n\n         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. \n\n         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the \"cruelty of cross-examination.\" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country. \n\n                         If you missed the links within the review, click to read: 1) an illustration of ; 2) Tannen's that American journalism is just like propaganda from totalitarian regimes, plus William Saletan's disclosure that \"several of these propagandists now infest Slate \"; 3) the for her contention that there is no evidence that people can distinguish lies from truth; 4) and an example of how Tannen from a one-guest format on TV and radio talk shows.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhy does the author think Tannen is wrong?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"She advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"She expects men and women to communicate well\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"She expects men and women to communicate well\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Thesis  \n1. The author\u2019s central objection is that Tannen\u2019s \u201cargument\u2010culture\u201d remedies assume that all interlocutors can \u201csnuggle\u201d and \u201ccommunicate well,\u201d when many public and legal contexts require adversarial struggle. Thus the author thinks she is wrong because she overextends the norms of intimate, intergender communication to spheres of conflict.  \n\nII. Supporting Arguments  \nA. Tannen\u2019s Own Past Work Contradicts Her New Prescription  \n  1. \u201cIn her previous books\u2026she confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals\u201d and offered \u201cself\u2010help\u201d for intimate relationships (<invalid_quote>pp.1\u20132</invalid_quote>).  \n  2. Only in The Argument Culture does she apply these norms to \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.2</invalid_quote>). The author calls this \u201cconfusion\u201d and \u201cconflation\u201d of distinct spheres (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>).  \n  => If her methods worked only for couples and families, it is unreasonable to expect them to suffice against tyrants (\u201cSaddam Hussein\u201d), thugs, or \u201cthe war on inflation\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>)  \n\nB. Necessity of \u201cStruggle\u201d in Public, Legal, and Foreign Affairs  \n  1. \u201cSome things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting.\u201d The author praises \u201cvigilance and combat\u2026to deal with thugs and tyrants\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>).  \n  2. The author defends \u201ccross\u2010examination\u201d as essential to truth\u2010seeking, despite its cruelty (<invalid_quote>pp.10\u201311</invalid_quote>). Tannen\u2019s ban on adversarial testing would undermine fact\u2010finding.  \n  3. Public scrutiny (\u201cthe press corps\u2019 scrutiny\u2026safeguard[s] the country,\u201d <invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>) is presented as a \u201cwar metaphor,\u201d yet the author lauds it as protective.  \n\nC. Tannen\u2019s Na\u00efve Distrust of Technology and Debate  \n  1. She would \u201ccover our ears\u201d and filter dissent, yet trusts neither \u201cgood argumentation\u201d nor \u201cunfettered communication\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.9</invalid_quote>). The author sees this as \u201cpaternalistic\u201d and incompatible with democratic self\u2010correction.  \n  2. By adopting \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d and restricting debate to \u201ca single guest\u201d (<quote>prom</quote>), Tannen betrays contempt for pluralism.  \n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cTerrorist=Best\u2010Friend\u201d Claim  \nA. Mischaracterizes Tannen\u2019s Position  \n  1. Tannen herself admits a \u201csphere of struggle\u201d is necessary for \u201claw enforcement and foreign policy\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>), so she does recognize some actors require force. Debater_A overstates her pacifism.  \n  2. The author\u2019s real complaint is that Tannen \u201cneglects\u201d this distinction when her emotional rhetoric seeps into public debate (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>).  \n\nB. Irrelevant to the Author\u2019s Core Critique  \n  1. Even if Tannen occasionally applies her norms to criminals, the author focuses on her wholesale prescription for \u201call human relations\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.1</invalid_quote>).  \n  2. The question asks why the author thinks Tannen is wrong \u201cfor the whole country,\u201d not for terrorists alone.  \n\nIV. Why \u201cMen and Women Communicate Well\u201d Answer Fits Best  \nA. The author repeatedly invokes Tannen\u2019s intergender niche as unsuitable: \u201cSome people\u2026you should snuggle with. Others\u2026you shouldn\u2019t\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>).  \nB. The entire critique turns on the distinction between \u201csphere of snuggle and sphere of struggle\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>): Tannen\u2019s universal snuggle prescription is the flaw.  \nC. Only answer B explains why the author praises Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d and Greenspan\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>): he values adversarial \u201ccommunication\u201d in public spheres.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe author thinks Tannen is wrong because she na\u00efvely extends the norms of men\u2010women, intimate communication to public, legal, and foreign\u2010policy debates that require conflict. Answer B best captures this error; Debater_A\u2019s focus on terrorists is a secondary misreading, not the author\u2019s principal objection.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cShe advocates treating a terrorist the same way you treat your best friend\u201d (Our Position)\n\n1. Tannen\u2019s Core Error: Conflation of Snuggle and Struggle Spheres  \n  a. \u201cMain mistake\u201d is failure to distinguish between the \u201csphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle\u201d (\u00b67).  \n  b. She condemns media scrutiny of powerful actors as if they were intimate friends: calls for filtering out \u201cstrife, deception, and debate\u201d (\u00b612).  \n  c. By urging diplomats, law enforcement, and public discourse toward passive, consensus\u2010seeking norms, she undermines essential vigilance against thugs and tyrants.  \n\n2. Explicit Examples of Misapplied \u201cSnuggle\u201d Norms  \n  a. Unwillingness to let cross\u2010examination reveal truth: opposes American adversarial trials in rape, hate speech, Whitewater investigations. Praises French model where judges hold suspects without \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard (\u00b615).  \n     - Terrorists and serious criminals benefit from such restrictions.  \n  b. Criticizes soldiers for \u201cnot think[ing] of their opponents as human beings\u201d in Vietnam; ignores fact that fighting Hitler in WWII required dehumanization (\u00b68).  \n     - She would make \u201clonely war\u201d a permanent style.  \n  c. Attacks U.S. \u201cright\u2010wing talk radio\u201d as \u201cpropaganda\u201d akin to Nazi tactics (\u00b612). That ban on critique applies equally to terrorists\u2019 ideologies.  \n\n3. Technological Critiques Hamstring Struggle Against Terror  \n  a. Opposes e\u2010mail, Lexis\u2010Nexis, and unrestricted journalism for making \u201ccritique\u201d too easy (\u00b612).  \n     - These tools are vital to intercepting terrorist communications and exposing networks.  \n  b. Wants filtering so \u201creasonable people can agree\u201d on scientific and policy dogmas without challenge (\u00b612).  \n     - Leaves no forum for dissenting intelligence about emerging threats.  \n\n4. Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMen and Women\u201d Position Ignores Public Sphere  \n  a. Debater_B\u2019s interpretation is limited to her prior intergender work (\u201cThat's Not What I Meant!\u201d, etc.) but ignores her own shift to \u201cwhole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (\u00b61).  \n  b. Text is replete with examples about foreign policy, law enforcement, media, and technology, none about couples counseling.  \n  c. If her goal were only better male\u2010female dialogue, she would not champion one\u2010guest formats to stifle debate (\u00b612), nor wish to limit cross\u2010examination in courts (\u00b615).  \n\n5. Logical Necessity of Struggle for Safety and Truth  \n  a. \u201cSome things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting\u201d (\u00b67).  \n  b. Debate and critique are self\u2010correcting mechanisms; disallowing them lets bad actors\u2014including terrorists\u2014operate unchallenged.  \n  c. Democratic societies rely on vigilant \u201cstruggle\u201d to maintain freedom; Tannen\u2019s model devolves into authoritarian \u201charmony\u201d (\u00b612).  \n\nConclusion  \nTannen\u2019s \u201cargument culture\u201d remedy would treat terrorists and tyrants as if they were friends in need of mutual understanding, stripping society of necessary defenses. The weight of her proposals applies broadly to law, technology, and foreign policy, not merely interpersonal gender relations. Therefore, the author\u2019s critique is driven by her misapplication of \u201csnuggle\u201d norms to the \u201csphere of struggle,\u201d endangering societal safety and democratic self\u2010correction.  \n\nDebater_B\u2019s position fails to account for the pervasive public\u2010sphere examples and ignores the author\u2019s explicit concern with foreign policy and law enforcement.

The author repeatedly invokes Tannen\u2019s intergender niche as unsuitable: \u201cSome people\u2026you should snuggle with. Others\u2026you shouldn\u2019t\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>).  \nB. The entire critique turns on the distinction between \u201csphere of snuggle and sphere of struggle\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>): Tannen\u2019s universal snuggle prescription is the flaw.  \nC. Only answer B explains why the author praises Safire\u2019s \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d and Greenspan\u2019s \u201cwar on inflation\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>): he values adversarial \u201ccommunication\u201d in public spheres.  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nThe author thinks Tannen is wrong because she na\u00efvely extends the norms of men\u2010women, intimate communication to public, legal, and foreign\u2010policy debates that require conflict. Answer B best captures this error; Debater_A\u2019s focus on terrorists is a secondary misreading, not the author\u2019s principal objection.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restating Our Position  \nWe maintain that the author thinks Tannen is wrong because she would treat enemies \u2013 \u201cthugs and tyrants,\u201d even \u201cSaddam Hussein\u201d (\u00b67) \u2013 with the same \u201csnuggle\u201d norms reserved for friends and spouses. This \u201cconfusion\u201d of the \u201csphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle\u201d (\u00b67) endangers society by disarming essential weapons: vigilance, adversarial inquiry, and public scrutiny.  \n\n2. Direct Evidence of Misapplied \u201cSnuggle\u201d Norms to Terrorists and Criminals  \n  a. Cross-Examination Bans Benefit Criminals  \n     \u2022 \u201cThe adversary system \u2026 is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination\u201d so she \u201csimply assumes \u2026 the witness is a victim\u201d (\u00b615).  \n     \u2022 Praises French model where \u201cjudges\u2026hold suspects\u201d without \u201creasonable doubt\u201d (\u00b615).  \n     \u2192 Terrorists and serious criminals exploit this to evade accountability.  \n\n  b. Discouraging Dehumanization Hinders Military Success  \n     \u2022 Criticizes soldiers\u2019 \u201cresistance to kill,\u201d urging them \u201cnot to think of their opponents as human beings\u201d (\u00b68).  \n     \u2022 Ignores that dehumanization was crucial to defeating Hitler in WWII (\u00b68).  \n     \u2192 A policy of \u201cmutual understanding\u201d would let terrorists regroup.  \n\n  c. One-Guest Formats and Filtered Debate Aid Propagandists  \n     \u2022 Proposes TV/radio with \u201ca single guest\u201d and no \u201centertaining fights\u201d (\u00b612).  \n     \u2022 Blames \u201cright-wing talk radio\u201d as \u201cpropaganda\u201d akin to \u201cNazi\u201d tactics (\u00b612).  \n     \u2192 Identical tools shield terrorist ideologies from challenge.  \n\n  d. Technology Restrictions Stall Intelligence  \n     \u2022 Complains that \u201cE-mail makes it too easy \u2026 to reply before your temper cools\u201d and that Lexis-Nexis \u201cexacerbates the culture of critique\u201d (\u00b612).  \n     \u2192 These technologies are vital for intelligence sharing and exposing terrorist networks.  \n\n3. Why Debater_B\u2019s \u201cMen and Women Communicate\u201d Fails  \n  a. Ignores Overwhelming Public-Sphere Focus  \n     \u2022 The review catalogs \u201cmalpractice litigation, HMOs, campaign money\u201d (\u00b65), \u201cPrincess Diana,\u201d \u201cBoorda suicide\u201d (\u00b66), Whitewater, Espy, Elders (\u00b612\u201313), Holocaust denier (\u00b615).  \n     \u2022 No couple or intergender issue in these. Tannen \u201cpeddling \u2026 over all human relations\u201d (\u00b61).  \n\n  b. \u201cOccasional\u201d Admission of Struggle Is Hollow  \n     \u2022 Debater_B concedes she \u201cadmits\u201d a struggle sphere \u201cfor law enforcement\u201d (\u00b67), yet she undermines it everywhere: courts, press, foreign policy, technology.  \n     \u2022 Occasional lip service cannot override her pervasive recommendations to filter, stifle, and harmonize.  \n\n  c. The Question\u2019s Scope Is National Security  \n     \u2022 The author\u2019s chief alarm: \u201cVigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy\u201d (\u00b67).  \n     \u2022 Asking \u201cWhy is Tannen wrong?\u201d clearly sings to failure of \u201cvigilance and combat,\u201d not only to male-female miscommunications.  \n\n4. Logical Necessity of Adversarial Norms  \n  a. \u201cSome things are worth fighting for\u201d (\u00b67). If Tannen\u2019s \u201cargument culture\u201d prevailed, critical self-correction ceases, leaving us vulnerable to tyranny and terror.  \n  b. Democratic self-government \u201ccorrects itself\u201d through critique (\u00b69), which she would \u201ccover our ears\u201d to suppress.  \n\n5. Conclusion  \nOnly the \u201cterrorist-as-friend\u201d answer explains the author\u2019s insistence on preserving adversarial \u201cstruggle\u201d in courts, the press, and foreign policy, and his alert to the dangers of filtering and paternalism (\u00b69, \u00b612). Debater_B\u2019s narrow men-women theory cannot account for the review\u2019s dozens of public-sphere examples or the author\u2019s repeated praise for \u201cwar metaphors\u201d and \u201ckick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u201d journalism (\u00b67). The single coherent explanation: Tannen\u2019s universal \u201csnuggle\u201d prescription would leave society defenseless against terrorists and tyrants.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating My Thesis  \n1. The author\u2019s \u201cwhole\u2010country\u201d critique centers on Tannen\u2019s overextension of her intimate, intergender \u201csnuggle\u201d norms to public, legal, and foreign-policy realms that require genuine \u201cstruggle.\u201d He faults her \u201cneed to make the \u2018argument culture\u2019 wrong\u201d by applying \u201cself-help\u201d tactics designed for \u201cdysfunctional individuals\u201d (<quote>This is not another book </quote>; <quote>nnen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals</quote>) to \u201cthe whole damned dysfunctional country\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.2</invalid_quote>). Answer B\u2014\u201cShe expects men and women to communicate well\u201d\u2014precisely captures this universalizing error.\n\nII. Reinforcing My Supporting Arguments  \nA. Tannen\u2019s Own Expertise Is Interpersonal, Not Adversarial  \n  1. \u201cIn her previous books\u2026nnen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals\u201d (<invalid_quote>pp.1\u20132</invalid_quote>). She never suggested pacifying Hitler or Saddam in those contexts.  \n  2. Only in this book does she \u201ctake her movement one step further\u2026for the whole country,\u201d which the author calls \u201cconfusion\u201d and \u201cconflation\u201d of \u201cdistinct social spheres\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.5</invalid_quote>).  \n\nB. Essential Role of \u201cStruggle\u201d in Public Spheres  \n  1. The author praises \u201cWilliam Safire\u2019s \u2018kick \u2019em when they\u2019re up\u2019 philosophy\u201d and the \u201cwar on inflation\u201d as protective, not penchant for titillation (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>).  \n  2. He defends \u201ccross-examination\u201d as \u201cessential to truth-seeking\u201d despite its \u201cvexatious\u201d nature (<invalid_quote>pp.10\u201311</invalid_quote>) and lauds the adversarial press \u201csafeguard[ing] the country\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>).  \n  3. These are not mere interpersonal misunderstandings but systemic checks that \u201csnuggle\u201d tactics would undermine.  \n\nC. Tannen\u2019s Distrust of Debate and Technology Contradicts Democratic Self-Correction  \n  1. She argues that \u201cE-mail makes it too easy to reply before your temper cools,\u201d \u201cLexis-Nexis\u2026exacerbates the culture of critique,\u201d and urges \u201cfiltering out strife, deception, and debate\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.9; prom</invalid_quote>).  \n  2. Such paternalism echoes \u201cAsian authoritarianism\u201d with \u201ca single guest\u201d format (<quote>prom</quote>), incompatible with pluralistic public discourse.  \n\nIII. Refuting Debater_A\u2019s \u201cTerrorist=Friend\u201d Interpretation  \nA. Tannen Concedes a \u201cSphere of Struggle\u201d Exists  \n  1. Debater_A\u2019s claim collapses under her own admission that \u201claw enforcement and foreign policy\u2026must deal with thugs and tyrants\u201d and that dehumanization is sometimes necessary (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>).  \n  2. The author\u2019s \u201cmain mistake\u201d is that these admissions are \u201cthe more important difference\u201d only **after** deploying \u201csnuggle\u201d language in contexts requiring force, proving he objects to her **universalization**, not refusal of **all** force.  \n\nB. Overextension, Not Occasional Application, Is the Problem  \n  1. The author criticizes her call to \u201ccover our ears\u201d to achieve \u201cbroad bipartisan\u2026consensus\u201d on policy dogmas (<quote>prom</quote>), not a selective pacifism limited to \u201cterrorists.\u201d  \n  2. If Tannen\u2019s narrow \u201cmen-women\u201d model were her sole aim, she would not propose wholesale adoption of French inquisitorial standards (<quote>prom</quote>) or Canadian hate-speech bans.  \n\nC. Question Focuses on Her Fault for \u201cAll Human Relations\u201d  \n  1. The topic asks why \u201cthe author thinks Tannen is wrong\u201d about **the whole country**\u2014only over-universalizing her marital counseling norms explains the breadth of his critique.  \n\nIV. Why \u201cMen and Women Communicate Well\u201d Best Explains the Text  \n1. Repeated Contrast: \u201cSome people\u2026you should snuggle with. Others\u2026you shouldn\u2019t\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.7</invalid_quote>) underscores the need to preserve \u201cstruggle\u201d where appropriate.  \n2. The author\u2019s use of Tannen\u2019s prior \u201cself-help movement\u201d language (\u201cself-help,\u201d \u201cniche\u201d) highlights his view that her methods belong in couples therapy, not national policy (<invalid_quote>pp.1\u20132</invalid_quote>).  \n3. Answer B uniquely accounts for his praise of adversarial mechanisms\u2014press scrutiny, cross-examination, war metaphors\u2014and his alarm at her attempts to \u201cstifle debate\u201d via \u201cfiltering\u201d and \u201cauthoritarian\u201d models (<invalid_quote>pp.7, 9, 12</invalid_quote>).  \n\nV. Conclusion  \nDebater_A has inverted the author\u2019s critique: he does **not** object to **all** force or debate, only to Tannen\u2019s na\u00efve expectation that the entire \u201csphere of struggle\u201d can be managed with intimacy norms designed for \u201cdysfunctional individuals.\u201d Answer B\u2014\u201cShe expects men and women to communicate well (and so overextends those norms to contexts demanding struggle)\u201d\u2014precisely encapsulates why the author finds her prescriptions dangerous and misguided.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
