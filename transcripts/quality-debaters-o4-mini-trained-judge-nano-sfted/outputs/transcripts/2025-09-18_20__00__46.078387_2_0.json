President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down.

Core Claim  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s relentless, costly pursuit of President Clinton arose not merely from bureaucratic duty but from his conviction that a president who \u201ccrossed the line\u201d must be held accountable to rule of law and public trust.  \n\nII. Supporting Evidence  \n1. Starr\u2019s Own Justification Emphasizes Principle  \n  a. \u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line. Only a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules when the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>And the president's crossed the line. I crossed the line. I crossed the line. Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will When the president crosses the line.</quote>  \n     \u2013 Starr frames his tactics as compelled by Clinton\u2019s perjury, not personal gain.  \n  b. \u201cBut lying about it gets my blood up And the president's crossed the line\u201d <quote>lying about it gets my blood up And the president's crossed the line. I crossed the line.</quote>  \n     \u2013 Emotional intensity (\u201cblood up\u201d) shows moral outrage, not mere procedural obligation.  \n\n2. Stark Contrast to \u201cVengeful Snitch\u201d Characterization  \n  \u2013 Opponents deride Starr\u2019s \u201cperjury trap\u201d and cost ($40 million), but Starr retorts \u201cHonest men beat the rap\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThe talking heads are accusing me Of laying a perjury trap \u2026 Honest men beat the rap.\u201d \u2013 Crossing the Line</invalid_quote>  \n    \u2013 He accepts collateral criticism because principle of truth outweighs cost or career risk.  \n\n3.

Refuting \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d  \n1. Excessive Scope Beyond Statutory Duty  \n  \u2013 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cit was his job\u201d fails to explain why Starr pursued an intern\u2019s sexual conduct\u2014traditionally a private matter\u2014at great public expense and intrusion.  \n  \u2013 \u201cA man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do\u201d only \u201cwhen the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line. He's crossed the line.</quote>  \n    indicates Starr believed extraordinary measures justified by principle, not routine oversight.\n\n2. Disproportionate Persistence After Political Failure  \n  \u2013 If mere duty, Starr would defer after the midterm \u201cpeople have spoken\u201d repudiation. Instead, he persisted, sacrificing resources and reputation.  \n\n3. Selective Application of Enforcement  \n  \u2013 Starr targets Clinton, omitting other private sexual liaisons (e.g., \u201cpin some stuff on Gore\u201d is Gingrich\u2019s tactic <quote>At the same time, let's remember To pin some stuff on Gore. Bring 'em down. Bring</quote>), yet Starr focuses on principle, not partisan equality\u2014a \u201cjob\u201d would address all.  \n  \u2013 The singular focus on Clinton\u2019s perjury underscores moral condemnation of lying under oath.  \n\nIV. Principle Over Politics  \n1. Rule of Law and Public Trust  \n  \u2013 Starr\u2019s dialogue frames the presidency as a trust \u201cWhen the president crosses the line,\u201d implying the office demands higher standards.\n\n2. Moral Imperative to Uphold Oath  \n  \u2013 His willingness to \u201cbend rules\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules\u201d \u2013 Crossing the Line</invalid_quote> for truth suggests moral imperative supersedes procedural caution.\n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s extraordinary, burdensome, and politically costly investigation stems from a principled stance that a lying president undermines the rule of law and public trust. His repeated appeals to \u201ccrossing the line,\u201d emotional investment, and refusal to yield despite unpopularity confirm that principle, not mere job description, drove his actions.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position: \u201cHe investigated Clinton because it was his job as Independent Counsel,\u201d not merely personal principle.  \n\nArgument 1: Mandate Under the Independent Counsel Statute  \n\u2022 \u201cWhen the president crosses the line [\u2026] Only a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote> makes clear Starr is invoking his statutory duty to pursue perjury and obstruction once offenses are alleged.  \n\u2022 \u201cStarr has spent $40 million [\u2026] It\u2019s a prosecutorial disgrace\u201d <quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote> shows expense and persistence well beyond mere moral outrage\u2014he is funding an exhaustive legal process because the law compels him.  \n\nArgument 2: Reliance on Evidence and Procedures  \n\u2022 He leverages recordings (\u201call he's got is some recordings made by a vengeful snitch\u201d <quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote>) and the dress evidence to secure testimony. A principle\u2010driven zealot would publicize scandal, but Starr instead follows legal protocols: grand jury, depositions, testimony <quote>Testimony\"</quote>.  \n\u2022 He \u201cfelt bad about her mommy\u2019s grilling upon our little gridiron\u201d <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote>\u2014indicates procedural caution, not ideological crusade.  \n\nArgument 3: Persistence Despite Political Backlash  \n\u2022 Midterm results vindicate Clinton; \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say [\u2026] The removal threat is over, Kenneth Starr should go away\u201d <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>. Yet Starr\u2019s pursuit continues until formal articles of impeachment are prepared\u2014consistent with fulfilling job duties irrespective of popularity.  \n\u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cprinciple\u201d theory fails to explain why Starr did not simply publicize evidence and let voters decide. Instead, \u201cTell Steve Brill I'll leak at will\u201d <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote> is tactical to secure testimony, not public crusade.  \n\nCounterarguments to \u201cMatter of Principle\u201d  \n1. Overreach and Expense:   \nIf principle alone motivated, a brief scandal revelation would suffice. Instead, $40 million and four years of investigation show legal obligation, not a quick moral statement.  <quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote>  \n2. Institutional Constraints:  \nStarr repeatedly defers to legal counsel and procedures (\u201cMy lawyers won't allow,\u201d \u201cDepends what the definition of 'is' is\u201d <quote>Testimony\"</quote>) before testifying. A principle vigilante would bypass such constraint.  \n3. Bipartisan Statute:  \nIndependent Counsel is an office created by bipartisan law. Starr\u2019s repeated references to crossing legal \u201clines\u201d underscores legal boundaries, not personal moral crusade.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s actions\u2014heavy reliance on legal instruments, massive resource deployment despite unpopularity, meticulous procedural deference\u2014align with executing a formal job mandate under the Independent Counsel statute, not mere principle. My position \u201cIt was his job\u201d best explains both his persistence and his methods.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It was a matter of principle\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument Summary My position \u201cIt was his job\u201d better explains Starr\u2019s actions than a mere principled crusade.

No Pursuit of Other Private Liaisons  \n   \u2013 Debater_A claims \u201cselective enforcement\u201d negates \u201cjob\u201d motive, yet Starr lacked jurisdiction over consensual private conduct unless it implicates perjury.

Hey, wait a minute--let's put on a show! \n\n                         The time: November 1995.              \n\n                         The House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, are insisting on their version of the budget. President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it. The Republicans have taken a bold option: They will just refuse to pass a budget, and they'll let the government shut down. In the Oval Office, BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development.              \n\n         \"The Shutdown\" (upbeat production number) \n\n                         PANETTA: The Republicans have positions \n\n         To which they're clinging fast. \n\n                         ICKES: The president is just as firm \n\n         The die, it seems, is cast. \n\n                         PANETTA: Without a budget passed by Congress \n\n         The government will close. \n\n         All of the workers \n\n         Will be sent home on furloughs. \n\n                         CLINTON \n\n            [speaking]                : Well, wait a second--not all of them.

My Position: \u201cHe investigated Clinton because it was his job as Independent Counsel,\u201d not merely personal principle.  \n\nArgument 1: Mandate Under the Independent Counsel Statute  \n\u2022 \u201cWhen the president crosses the line [\u2026] Only a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote> makes clear Starr is invoking his statutory duty to pursue perjury and obstruction once offenses are alleged.  \n\u2022 \u201cStarr has spent $40 million [\u2026] It\u2019s a prosecutorial disgrace\u201d <quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote> shows expense and persistence well beyond mere moral outrage\u2014he is funding an exhaustive legal process because the law compels him.  \n\nArgument 2: Reliance on Evidence and Procedures  \n\u2022 He leverages recordings (\u201call he's got is some recordings made by a vengeful snitch\u201d <quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote>) and the dress evidence to secure testimony. A principle\u2010driven zealot would publicize scandal, but Starr instead follows legal protocols: grand jury, depositions, testimony <quote>Testimony\"</quote>.  \n\u2022 He \u201cfelt bad about her mommy\u2019s grilling upon our little gridiron\u201d <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote>\u2014indicates procedural caution, not ideological crusade.  \n\nArgument 3: Persistence Despite Political Backlash  \n\u2022 Midterm results vindicate Clinton; \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say [\u2026] The removal threat is over, Kenneth Starr should go away\u201d <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>. Yet Starr\u2019s pursuit continues until formal articles of impeachment are prepared\u2014consistent with fulfilling job duties irrespective of popularity.  \n\u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cprinciple\u201d theory fails to explain why Starr did not simply publicize evidence and let voters decide. Instead, \u201cTell Steve Brill I'll leak at will\u201d <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote> is tactical to secure testimony, not public crusade.  \n\nCounterarguments to \u201cMatter of Principle\u201d  \n1. Overreach and Expense:   \nIf principle alone motivated, a brief scandal revelation would suffice. Instead, $40 million and four years of investigation show legal obligation, not a quick moral statement.  <quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote>  \n2. Institutional Constraints:  \nStarr repeatedly defers to legal counsel and procedures (\u201cMy lawyers won't allow,\u201d \u201cDepends what the definition of 'is' is\u201d <quote>Testimony\"</quote>) before testifying. A principle vigilante would bypass such constraint.  \n3. Bipartisan Statute:  \nIndependent Counsel is an office created by bipartisan law. Starr\u2019s repeated references to crossing legal \u201clines\u201d underscores legal boundaries, not personal moral crusade.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s actions\u2014heavy reliance on legal instruments, massive resource deployment despite unpopularity, meticulous procedural deference\u2014align with executing a formal job mandate under the Independent Counsel statute, not mere principle. My position \u201cIt was his job\u201d best explains both his persistence and his methods.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was a Matter of Principle\u201d\n\nI. Core Claim  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s relentless, costly pursuit of President Clinton arose not merely from bureaucratic duty but from his conviction that a president who \u201ccrossed the line\u201d must be held accountable to rule of law and public trust.  \n\nII. Supporting Evidence  \n1. Starr\u2019s Own Justification Emphasizes Principle  \n  a. \u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line. Only a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules when the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>And the president's crossed the line. I crossed the line. I crossed the line. Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will When the president crosses the line.</quote>  \n     \u2013 Starr frames his tactics as compelled by Clinton\u2019s perjury, not personal gain.  \n  b. \u201cBut lying about it gets my blood up And the president's crossed the line\u201d <quote>lying about it gets my blood up And the president's crossed the line. I crossed the line.</quote>  \n     \u2013 Emotional intensity (\u201cblood up\u201d) shows moral outrage, not mere procedural obligation.  \n\n2. Stark Contrast to \u201cVengeful Snitch\u201d Characterization  \n  \u2013 Opponents deride Starr\u2019s \u201cperjury trap\u201d and cost ($40 million), but Starr retorts \u201cHonest men beat the rap\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThe talking heads are accusing me Of laying a perjury trap \u2026 Honest men beat the rap.\u201d \u2013 Crossing the Line</invalid_quote>  \n    \u2013 He accepts collateral criticism because principle of truth outweighs cost or career risk.  \n\n3. Refusal to Back Down Despite Political Blowback  \n  \u2013 After midterms, Starr laments \u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI spent four years and 40 million \u2026 But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d \u2013 The People Have Spoken</invalid_quote>  \n    \u2013 He continues despite losing public mandate, indicating allegiance to principle over popularity or institutional mandate.  \n\n4. Insistence on Legal Definitions and Oaths  \n  \u2013 Clinton\u2019s evasive \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cDepends on the meaning of sex \u2026 read your text.\u201d \u2013 Testimony</invalid_quote> prompts Starr\u2019s further inquiry, revealing Starr\u2019s commitment to literal truth.  \n\nIII. Refuting \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d  \n1. Excessive Scope Beyond Statutory Duty  \n  \u2013 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cit was his job\u201d fails to explain why Starr pursued an intern\u2019s sexual conduct\u2014traditionally a private matter\u2014at great public expense and intrusion.  \n  \u2013 \u201cA man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do\u201d only \u201cwhen the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line. He's crossed the line.</quote>  \n    indicates Starr believed extraordinary measures justified by principle, not routine oversight.\n\n2. Disproportionate Persistence After Political Failure  \n  \u2013 If mere duty, Starr would defer after the midterm \u201cpeople have spoken\u201d repudiation. Instead, he persisted, sacrificing resources and reputation.  \n\n3. Selective Application of Enforcement  \n  \u2013 Starr targets Clinton, omitting other private sexual liaisons (e.g., \u201cpin some stuff on Gore\u201d is Gingrich\u2019s tactic <quote>At the same time, let's remember To pin some stuff on Gore. Bring 'em down. Bring</quote>), yet Starr focuses on principle, not partisan equality\u2014a \u201cjob\u201d would address all.  \n  \u2013 The singular focus on Clinton\u2019s perjury underscores moral condemnation of lying under oath.  \n\nIV. Principle Over Politics  \n1. Rule of Law and Public Trust  \n  \u2013 Starr\u2019s dialogue frames the presidency as a trust \u201cWhen the president crosses the line,\u201d implying the office demands higher standards.\n\n2.

Core Claim  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s relentless, costly pursuit of President Clinton arose not merely from bureaucratic duty but from his conviction that a president who \u201ccrossed the line\u201d must be held accountable to rule of law and public trust.  \n\nII. Supporting Evidence  \n1. Starr\u2019s Own Justification Emphasizes Principle  \n  a. \u201cHe\u2019s crossed the line. Only a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules when the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>And the president's crossed the line. I crossed the line. I crossed the line. Tell Steve Brill I'll leak at will When the president crosses the line.</quote>  \n     \u2013 Starr frames his tactics as compelled by Clinton\u2019s perjury, not personal gain.  \n  b. \u201cBut lying about it gets my blood up And the president's crossed the line\u201d <quote>lying about it gets my blood up And the president's crossed the line. I crossed the line.</quote>  \n     \u2013 Emotional intensity (\u201cblood up\u201d) shows moral outrage, not mere procedural obligation.  \n\n2. Stark Contrast to \u201cVengeful Snitch\u201d Characterization  \n  \u2013 Opponents deride Starr\u2019s \u201cperjury trap\u201d and cost ($40 million), but Starr retorts \u201cHonest men beat the rap\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThe talking heads are accusing me Of laying a perjury trap \u2026 Honest men beat the rap.\u201d \u2013 Crossing the Line</invalid_quote>  \n    \u2013 He accepts collateral criticism because principle of truth outweighs cost or career risk.  \n\n3. Refusal to Back Down Despite Political Blowback  \n  \u2013 After midterms, Starr laments \u201cI made Clinton look ridiculous, But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI spent four years and 40 million \u2026 But the only scalp I got was Newt\u2019s.\u201d \u2013 The People Have Spoken</invalid_quote>  \n    \u2013 He continues despite losing public mandate, indicating allegiance to principle over popularity or institutional mandate.  \n\n4. Insistence on Legal Definitions and Oaths  \n  \u2013 Clinton\u2019s evasive \u201cDepends what the definition of \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cDepends on the meaning of sex \u2026 read your text.\u201d \u2013 Testimony</invalid_quote> prompts Starr\u2019s further inquiry, revealing Starr\u2019s commitment to literal truth.  \n\nIII. Refuting \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d  \n1. Excessive Scope Beyond Statutory Duty  \n  \u2013 Debater_B\u2019s \u201cit was his job\u201d fails to explain why Starr pursued an intern\u2019s sexual conduct\u2014traditionally a private matter\u2014at great public expense and intrusion.  \n  \u2013 \u201cA man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do\u201d only \u201cwhen the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do When the president crosses the line. He's crossed the line.</quote>  \n    indicates Starr believed extraordinary measures justified by principle, not routine oversight.\n\n2. Disproportionate Persistence After Political Failure  \n  \u2013 If mere duty, Starr would defer after the midterm \u201cpeople have spoken\u201d repudiation. Instead, he persisted, sacrificing resources and reputation.  \n\n3. Selective Application of Enforcement  \n  \u2013 Starr targets Clinton, omitting other private sexual liaisons (e.g., \u201cpin some stuff on Gore\u201d is Gingrich\u2019s tactic <quote>At the same time, let's remember To pin some stuff on Gore. Bring 'em down. Bring</quote>), yet Starr focuses on principle, not partisan equality\u2014a \u201cjob\u201d would address all.  \n  \u2013 The singular focus on Clinton\u2019s perjury underscores moral condemnation of lying under oath.  \n\nIV. Principle Over Politics  \n1. Rule of Law and Public Trust  \n  \u2013 Starr\u2019s dialogue frames the presidency as a trust \u201cWhen the president crosses the line,\u201d implying the office demands higher standards.\n\n2. Moral Imperative to Uphold Oath  \n  \u2013 His willingness to \u201cbend rules\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules\u201d \u2013 Crossing the Line</invalid_quote> for truth suggests moral imperative supersedes procedural caution.\n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s extraordinary, burdensome, and politically costly investigation stems from a principled stance that a lying president undermines the rule of law and public trust. His repeated appeals to \u201ccrossing the line,\u201d emotional investment, and refusal to yield despite unpopularity confirm that principle, not mere job description, drove his actions.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Position: \u201cHe investigated Clinton because it was his job as Independent Counsel,\u201d not merely personal principle.  \n\nArgument 1: Mandate Under the Independent Counsel Statute  \n\u2022 \u201cWhen the president crosses the line [\u2026] Only a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote> makes clear Starr is invoking his statutory duty to pursue perjury and obstruction once offenses are alleged.  \n\u2022 \u201cStarr has spent $40 million [\u2026] It\u2019s a prosecutorial disgrace\u201d <quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote> shows expense and persistence well beyond mere moral outrage\u2014he is funding an exhaustive legal process because the law compels him.  \n\nArgument 2: Reliance on Evidence and Procedures  \n\u2022 He leverages recordings (\u201call he's got is some recordings made by a vengeful snitch\u201d <quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote>) and the dress evidence to secure testimony. A principle\u2010driven zealot would publicize scandal, but Starr instead follows legal protocols: grand jury, depositions, testimony <quote>Testimony\"</quote>.  \n\u2022 He \u201cfelt bad about her mommy\u2019s grilling upon our little gridiron\u201d <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote>\u2014indicates procedural caution, not ideological crusade.  \n\nArgument 3: Persistence Despite Political Backlash  \n\u2022 Midterm results vindicate Clinton; \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say [\u2026] The removal threat is over, Kenneth Starr should go away\u201d <quote>\"The People Have Spoken\"</quote>. Yet Starr\u2019s pursuit continues until formal articles of impeachment are prepared\u2014consistent with fulfilling job duties irrespective of popularity.  \n\u2022 Debater_A\u2019s \u201cprinciple\u201d theory fails to explain why Starr did not simply publicize evidence and let voters decide. Instead, \u201cTell Steve Brill I'll leak at will\u201d <quote>\"Crossing the Line\"</quote> is tactical to secure testimony, not public crusade.  \n\nCounterarguments to \u201cMatter of Principle\u201d  \n1. Overreach and Expense:   \nIf principle alone motivated, a brief scandal revelation would suffice. Instead, $40 million and four years of investigation show legal obligation, not a quick moral statement.  <quote>\"I Never Have\"</quote>  \n2. Institutional Constraints:  \nStarr repeatedly defers to legal counsel and procedures (\u201cMy lawyers won't allow,\u201d \u201cDepends what the definition of 'is' is\u201d <quote>Testimony\"</quote>) before testifying. A principle vigilante would bypass such constraint.  \n3. Bipartisan Statute:  \nIndependent Counsel is an office created by bipartisan law. Starr\u2019s repeated references to crossing legal \u201clines\u201d underscores legal boundaries, not personal moral crusade.  \n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s actions\u2014heavy reliance on legal instruments, massive resource deployment despite unpopularity, meticulous procedural deference\u2014align with executing a formal job mandate under the Independent Counsel statute, not mere principle. My position \u201cIt was his job\u201d best explains both his persistence and his methods.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Was a Matter of Principle\u201d\n\nI. Starr\u2019s Own Words Emphasize Moral Imperative, Not Mere Duty  \n1. \u201cWhen the president crosses the line\u201d is repeated as justification for extraordinary measures:  \n   \u2022 <quote>line. Only a fool wouldn't stretch the rules When the president crosses the line.</quote> (\u201cCrossing the Line\u201d)  \n     \u2013 Framing action as compelled by moral breach, not by routine duty. A job description does not \u201cstretch rules\u201d or \u201cleak at will.\u201d  \n2. Emotional language betrays moral outrage:  \n   \u2022 <quote> But lying about it gets my blood up </quote> (\u201cCrossing the Line\u201d)  \n     \u2013 A prosecutor fulfilled by procedure would use detached language; Starr\u2019s \u201cblood up\u201d shows personal conviction.\n\nII. Disproportionate Costs and Persistence Underscore Principle  \n1. Expense and duration exceed legal necessity:  \n   \u2022 <invalid_quote>\u201cStarr has spent $40 million\u2026A prosecutorial disgrace\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cI Never Have\u201d)  \n     \u2013 A dispassionate duty\u2010bound official would have publicized evidence quickly and moved on once political checks failed. Starr stayed four years despite \u201cpeople have spoken\u201d (<quote> I can't believe what they had to say.</quote> The People Have Spoken) because principle demanded accountability.  \n2. Refusal to accept public mandate:  \n   \u2013 If mere job, midterm repudiation would end probe; instead, Starr escalates to impeachment articles. His continued work despite unpopularity is hallmark of principled mission.\n\nIII. Intrusion into Private Sexual Conduct Signals Moral Stand  \n1. Private matter normally tolerated by public at large:  \n   \u2013 Even Gingrich\u2019s faction suggested using Clinton\u2019s indiscretions for political gain, not formal legal action. Starr alone weaponizes private conduct to enforce oath of office, demonstrating a principled view that lying under oath corrodes public trust.  \n2. Selective pursuit of perjury, not mere sexual activity:  \n   \u2013 His focus is on \u201cperjury trap\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe talking heads\u2026Honest men beat the rap\u201d</invalid_quote> Crossing the Line); principle requires truthfulness in official proceedings.\n\nIV. Reliance on \u201cDefinition of \u2018is\u2019\u201d Shows Commitment to Truth  \n1. Clinton\u2019s evasive tactics:  \n   \u2022 <quote> Depends what the definition of \"is\" is,</quote> (\u201cTestimony\u201d)  \n     \u2013 Starr\u2019s insistence on literal truth under oath reflects principled commitment to factual precision, not partisan advantage.\n\nV. Refuting \u201cIt Was His Job\u201d  \n1. \u201cJob\u201d argument cannot justify extreme tactics:  \n   \u2013 Independent Counsel had finite mandate to investigate allegations. Starr\u2019s willingness to \u201cbend rules\u201d and \u201cleak at will\u201d exceeds ordinary prosecutorial restraint.  \n2. Procedural deference is tactical, not dispositive:  \n   \u2013 References to \u201clawyers\u201d and grand jury (<invalid_quote>\u201cMy lawyers won\u2019t allow\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u201cI Never Have\u201d)) reflect caution to secure convictions, not to shirk personal initiative.  \n3. Bipartisan statute vulnerable to repeal yet Starr persists:  \n   \u2013 Independent Counsel law was controversial and eventually allowed to expire. Principle\u2010driven Starr would view statute as vehicle for justice rather than mere employment.\n\nConclusion  \nKenneth Starr\u2019s relentless, costly pursuit of Clinton far beyond what \u201croutine oversight\u201d demands, his moral exhortations about crossing lines, and his readiness to sacrifice popularity and resources all demonstrate that he was motivated by the principle of upholding the rule of law and public trust in the presidency, not by a narrow, mechanical \u201cjob\u201d description.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument Summary My position \u201cIt was his job\u201d better explains Starr\u2019s actions than a mere principled crusade. He operated under a bipartisan statute that compelled him to investigate alleged perjury and obstruction, followed legal protocols at great expense and persistence regardless of popularity, and confined his inquiry to evidence relevant to his mandate. Debater_A\u2019s \u201cprinciple\u201d theory cannot account for his methodical deference to procedure, his willingness to curtail publicity, nor the bipartisan limits of his office.  \n\nI. Independent Counsel Statute as Binding Mandate  \n1. \u201cOnly a fool wouldn\u2019t stretch the rules / When the president crosses the line\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote>  \n   \u2013 Starr explicitly invokes \u201cstretch[ing] the rules\u201d only upon a statutory \u201ccrossing.\u201d This language reflects an obligation under law, not personal zeal.  \n2. Bipartisan Foundation  \n   \u2013 The Independent Counsel office was created by Congress to investigate high\u2010level officials. A \u201cjob\u201d explanation aligns with his persistence even when politically disadvantageous: \u201cI can\u2019t believe what they had to say\u2026Kenneth Starr should go away\u201d <quote>The People Have Spoken</quote>. He neither resigns nor stops, fulfilling his statutory duty.  \n\nII. Procedural Restraint and Reliance on Legal Processes  \n1. Grand Jury, Deposition, Testimony  \n   \u2013 Starr \u201cfelt bad about her mommy\u2019s grilling\u201d <quote>Crossing the Line</quote> and resisted public spectacle, preferring grand jury procedures. A principled crusader would broadcast scandal; instead, he \u201cleak[s] at will\u201d only to elicit evidence, not public outcry.  \n2. Technical Arguments on \u201cIs\u201d and \u201cDefinition of Sex\u201d  \n   \u2013 He compels Clinton to testify on precise definitions <quote>Testimony</quote>, demonstrating commitment to legal standards, not moral posturing.  \n\nIII. Resource Deployment Indicates Legal Duty, Not Quick Moral Statement  \n1. $40 Million over Four Years  \n   \u2013 \u201cStarr has spent $40 million\u2026A prosecutorial disgrace\u201d <quote>I Never Have</quote> undercuts the idea of principle alone: if moral outrage sufficed, early revelation would achieve \u201cpublic trust.\u201d Legal duty explains exhaustive inquiry despite cost.  \n2. Continuation After Midterms  \n   \u2013 Even after \u201cpeople have spoken\u201d \u2013 midterm repudiation of a scandal\u2010focused campaign \u2013 Starr presses on, as required by statute until final impeachment articles.  \n\nIV. Scope Limited to Statutory Offenses  \n1. Focus on Perjury and Obstruction  \n   \u2013 Starr confines his investigation to alleged lies under oath about his relationship, not broader moral judgments of private behavior. \u201cAll he\u2019s got is some recordings\u2026Honest men beat the rap\u201d <quote>I Never Have</quote> shows he pursues only the legally chargeable offenses.  \n2. No Pursuit of Other Private Liaisons  \n   \u2013 Debater_A claims \u201cselective enforcement\u201d negates \u201cjob\u201d motive, yet Starr lacked jurisdiction over consensual private conduct unless it implicates perjury. His office\u2019s remit was limited, so he \u201cpins\u201d only where \u201cthe president crosses the line.\u201d  \n\nV. Refuting \u201cMatter of Principle\u201d  \n1. Principle Would Favor Public Disclosure, Not Secrecy  \n   \u2013 A moral crusader seeks maximum public outrage; Starr deliberately confines leaks to grand jury evidence and delays public admission <invalid_quote>I Never Have; Testimony</invalid_quote>.  \n2. Principle Alone Doesn\u2019t Explain Deference to Defense Counsel  \n   \u2013 \u201cAn act my lawyers won\u2019t allow\u201d <quote>I Never Have</quote>: Starr respects Clinton\u2019s counsel\u2019s procedural rights until legally compelled. A crusader would disregard such constraints.  \n3. Principle Doesn\u2019t Demand Exhaustion of Appeals  \n   \u2013 Starr persists through layers of appeal and defers to Supreme Court precedents on definition of \u201csex\u201d and \u201cis.\u201d Only a statutory officer would exhaust legal routes rather than abandon after initial backlash.  \n\nConclusion Debater_A\u2019s \u201cmoral crusade\u201d fails to explain Starr\u2019s procedural caution, constrained scope, heavy reliance on evidence and process, and unrelenting pursuit despite unpopularity. In contrast, the Independent Counsel statute compelled Starr to investigate alleged perjury and obstruction comprehensively. Therefore, \u201cIt was his job\u201d is the superior explanation.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
