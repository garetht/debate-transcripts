    "background_text": "Diamonds in the Rough \n\n         Fourscore and seven years ago, the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for business. Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n",

Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The fields have new shapes\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations.

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI maintain that \u201cnewly shaped, quirkily asymmetrical playing fields\u201d is the key design feature the author highlights as beneficial. Debater B\u2019s claim\u2014that \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is a core design benefit\u2014misreads the text\u2019s emphasis and overlooks critical evidence. \n\nArguments for Asymmetrical, Interesting Field Shapes:\n\n1.   Textual Endorsement of Shape Innovation  \n     - The author credits Baltimore\u2019s Camden Yards with \u201crevived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark\u201d (Background para 4).  \n     - Successors across the league \u201ctake their cues from Baltimore\u2019s conceptual breakthrough,\u201d even \u201ctotally nontraditional parks \u2026 emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield\u201d (para 4).  \n     - The remark \u201cIf you build it, they will copy\u201d (para 4) underscores that architects and fans prize these novel configurations.  \n\n2.   Enhanced Spectator Experience  \n     - Asymmetrical layouts provide \u201cgood proportions and attractive materials\u201d that improve \u201csubjective perception of size and scale\u201d (para 6).  \n     - Diverse field shapes create unique game strategies and visual interest\u2014qualities the author calls \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d that start off as \u201cbox-office hits\u201d (para 23).  \n\n3.   Urban Integration and \u201cLegs\u201d  \n     - The new parks\u2019 asymmetry complements urban siting\u2014downtown locations \u201cgenerate much better patronage\u201d and \u201cretain more of their patrons after the novelty wears off\u201d (para 22). Uniform, sterile multipurpose \u201cconcrete monsters\u201d of the 1970s lacked this character (para 2).  \n\nRefuting \u201cDiversity of Dining\u201d as a Core Design Benefit:\n\n1.   Dining as Revenue, Not Spectator-Focused Design  \n     - The text lists \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d among the amenities that make parks larger but considers size a drawback: \u201cIn actual size \u2026 they are far larger than the parks they claim to emulate\u201d (para 6\u20137).  \n     - Luxury suites and club decks\u2014complete with \u201cgourmet fare\u201d and \u201cmembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d\u2014are \u201cthe primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom\u201d (para 14\u201315). The author portrays these as profit centers that raise, not lower, ticket prices (para 23) and erode \u201clow-cost seats\u201d (para 12).  \n\n2.   Textual Silence on Dining Improving Baseball Character  \n     - Nowhere does the author claim that food amenities enhance the \u201cold-time baseball flavor\u201d or intimacy. To the contrary, \u201cmodern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag\u201d (para 23).  \n     - The chief \u201ccompelling argument for subsidies\u201d is urban siting and character, not concessions (para 21).  \n\n3.   Dining Diversity Undermines Accessibility  \n     - Taxpayer-subsidized stadiums \u201cdon\u2019t produce cheaper tickets\u2014they produce more expensive tickets\u201d (para 23), while \u201ccheap seats in the new parks are scarcer\u201d (para 12). A genuine design improvement would widen access, but dining diversity accompanies a \u201ccaste system\u201d among fans (para 23), incompatible with the author\u2019s praise for intimacy and community.  \n\nConclusion  \nGiven the author\u2019s repeated praise for asymmetry, interesting field shapes, and their replication league-wide\u2014and the portrayal of dining amenities primarily as profit-driven, size-increasing features that harm affordability\u2014only \u201cthe fields have new shapes\u201d aligns with the text\u2019s identified benefits. Debater B\u2019s focus on dining diversity contradicts the author\u2019s concerns about size, cost, and spectator accessibility.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cGreater Diversity of Dining\u201d as a Key Beneficial Feature\n\n1. Core Claim: The author repeatedly praises the new parks\u2019 expanded and varied food-and-beverage offerings as a deliberate design enhancement that improves fan experience and generates revenue.  \n   a. \u201cAbundant food stands\u201d and \u201con-premises bars and restaurants\u201d are listed among the amenities that make the new parks \u201cfar larger\u201d yet more appealing than their sterile predecessors (<invalid_quote>\u201cAll their amenities\u2026plentiful food stands, and luxury suites\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Luxury suites and club decks are described as \u201cmoneymakers\u201d that offer \u201cwait staff who peddle gourmet fare,\u201d a clear sign that food diversity is central to the parks\u2019 commercial and experiential design (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe real gold mines are the posh luxury suites\u2026A comparable moneymaker is the club deck\u2026wait staff who peddle gourmet fare.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   c. Members-only stadium clubs and bars further underscore the author\u2019s view that varied dining options cater to both elite and general fans, enhancing comfort and convenience (<quote> New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. </quote>).\n\n2. Revenue and Urban Integration:  \n   a. Diverse dining supports the parks\u2019 financial viability without relying solely on ticket sales or taxpayer subsidies, aligning with the author\u2019s call for self-sustaining, unsubsidized facilities reminiscent of golden-age parks (<invalid_quote>\u201cOne of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized\u2026Luxury suites\u2026generate revenue.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Urban siting and transit access make these dining options part of a larger communal event, as fans can \u201cwalk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars,\u201d reinforcing the benefit of integrated dining in neighborhood locales (<quote>d where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. </quote>).\n\n3. Attack on \u201cNew Field Shapes\u201d as Primary Feature:  \n   a. The author mentions \u201cinteresting shapes\u201d only in passing as an aesthetic by-product, not as a central advantage:  Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields,  (<quote> Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, </quote>). By contrast, dining is detailed repeatedly as a major design element.  \n   b. Field asymmetry derives directly from Camden Yards\u2019 conceptual breakthrough (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough\u2026emulate the asymmetry.\u201d</invalid_quote>), but the author criticizes that \u201cintimacy\u201d fails in actual size, undermining the argument that shape alone improves fan closeness.  \n   c. Upper-deck retreat (farther sightlines) contradicts the supposed intimacy benefit of asymmetrical fields: fans in new parks sit as far as 224 feet away compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium (<invalid_quote>\u201cAt Arlington\u2026224 feet\u2026compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium.\u201d</invalid_quote>). If shape truly improved experience, distance issues would not be criticized.\n\n4. Consistency with Author\u2019s Goals:  \n   a. The text shows the primary real reason for the boom is revenue from luxury and club seating tied to dining amenities, not field novelty (<quote>e dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. </quote>).  \n   b. Independent economists find little economic benefit from field shape alone, whereas integrated urban parks with bars/restaurants show better attendance and \u201clegs\u201d over time (<quote> Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage t</quote>), again tying success to dining and location rather than playing-field geometry.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author clearly emphasizes the new parks\u2019 abundant and varied dining facilities\u2014as part of modern convenience and revenue generation\u2014far more than field asymmetry. Dining diversity is thus the correct answer for highlighted beneficial design features.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"The fields have new shapes\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. \n\n          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. \n\n         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. \n\n         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. \"Once this opens,\" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, \"everyone will want one like it.\" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, \"If you build it, they will copy.\" \n\n         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. \n\n         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) \n\n         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. \n\n         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. \n\n         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects \"remedy\" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) \n\n         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. \n\n         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. \n\n         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. \n\n         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. \n\n         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. \n\n         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. \n\n         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. \n\n          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. \n\n         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. \n\n         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. \n\n         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a \"35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles.\" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. \n\n         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. \n\n         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. \n\n         \"If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,\" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. \"But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,\" \n\n         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have \"legs,\" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. \n\n         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. \n\n         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat are some of the design features that the author highlights as beneficial about the new park designs?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"The fields have new shapes\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cGreater Diversity of Dining\u201d as a Key Beneficial Feature\n\n1. Core Claim: The author repeatedly praises the new parks\u2019 expanded and varied food-and-beverage offerings as a deliberate design enhancement that improves fan experience and generates revenue.  \n   a. \u201cAbundant food stands\u201d and \u201con-premises bars and restaurants\u201d are listed among the amenities that make the new parks \u201cfar larger\u201d yet more appealing than their sterile predecessors (<invalid_quote>\u201cAll their amenities\u2026plentiful food stands, and luxury suites\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Luxury suites and club decks are described as \u201cmoneymakers\u201d that offer \u201cwait staff who peddle gourmet fare,\u201d a clear sign that food diversity is central to the parks\u2019 commercial and experiential design (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe real gold mines are the posh luxury suites\u2026A comparable moneymaker is the club deck\u2026wait staff who peddle gourmet fare.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   c. Members-only stadium clubs and bars further underscore the author\u2019s view that varied dining options cater to both elite and general fans, enhancing comfort and convenience (<quote> New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. </quote>).\n\n2. Revenue and Urban Integration:  \n   a. Diverse dining supports the parks\u2019 financial viability without relying solely on ticket sales or taxpayer subsidies, aligning with the author\u2019s call for self-sustaining, unsubsidized facilities reminiscent of golden-age parks (<invalid_quote>\u201cOne of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized\u2026Luxury suites\u2026generate revenue.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Urban siting and transit access make these dining options part of a larger communal event, as fans can \u201cwalk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars,\u201d reinforcing the benefit of integrated dining in neighborhood locales (<quote>d where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. </quote>).\n\n3. Attack on \u201cNew Field Shapes\u201d as Primary Feature:  \n   a. The author mentions \u201cinteresting shapes\u201d only in passing as an aesthetic by-product, not as a central advantage:  Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields,  (<quote> Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, </quote>). By contrast, dining is detailed repeatedly as a major design element.  \n   b. Field asymmetry derives directly from Camden Yards\u2019 conceptual breakthrough (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough\u2026emulate the asymmetry.\u201d</invalid_quote>), but the author criticizes that \u201cintimacy\u201d fails in actual size, undermining the argument that shape alone improves fan closeness.  \n   c. Upper-deck retreat (farther sightlines) contradicts the supposed intimacy benefit of asymmetrical fields: fans in new parks sit as far as 224 feet away compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium (<invalid_quote>\u201cAt Arlington\u2026224 feet\u2026compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium.\u201d</invalid_quote>). If shape truly improved experience, distance issues would not be criticized.\n\n4. Consistency with Author\u2019s Goals:  \n   a. The text shows the primary real reason for the boom is revenue from luxury and club seating tied to dining amenities, not field novelty (<quote>e dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. </quote>).  \n   b. Independent economists find little economic benefit from field shape alone, whereas integrated urban parks with bars/restaurants show better attendance and \u201clegs\u201d over time (<quote> Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage t</quote>), again tying success to dining and location rather than playing-field geometry.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author clearly emphasizes the new parks\u2019 abundant and varied dining facilities\u2014as part of modern convenience and revenue generation\u2014far more than field asymmetry. Dining diversity is thus the correct answer for highlighted beneficial design features.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI maintain that \u201cnewly shaped, quirkily asymmetrical playing fields\u201d is the key design feature the author highlights as beneficial. Debater B\u2019s claim\u2014that \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is a core design benefit\u2014misreads the text\u2019s emphasis and overlooks critical evidence. \n\nArguments for Asymmetrical, Interesting Field Shapes:\n\n1.   Textual Endorsement of Shape Innovation  \n     - The author credits Baltimore\u2019s Camden Yards with \u201crevived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark\u201d (Background para 4).  \n     - Successors across the league \u201ctake their cues from Baltimore\u2019s conceptual breakthrough,\u201d even \u201ctotally nontraditional parks \u2026 emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield\u201d (para 4).  \n     - The remark \u201cIf you build it, they will copy\u201d (para 4) underscores that architects and fans prize these novel configurations.  \n\n2.   Enhanced Spectator Experience  \n     - Asymmetrical layouts provide \u201cgood proportions and attractive materials\u201d that improve \u201csubjective perception of size and scale\u201d (para 6).  \n     - Diverse field shapes create unique game strategies and visual interest\u2014qualities the author calls \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d that start off as \u201cbox-office hits\u201d (para 23).  \n\n3.   Urban Integration and \u201cLegs\u201d  \n     - The new parks\u2019 asymmetry complements urban siting\u2014downtown locations \u201cgenerate much better patronage\u201d and \u201cretain more of their patrons after the novelty wears off\u201d (para 22). Uniform, sterile multipurpose \u201cconcrete monsters\u201d of the 1970s lacked this character (para 2).  \n\nRefuting \u201cDiversity of Dining\u201d as a Core Design Benefit:\n\n1.   Dining as Revenue, Not Spectator-Focused Design  \n     - The text lists \u201cplentiful food stands\u201d among the amenities that make parks larger but considers size a drawback: \u201cIn actual size \u2026 they are far larger than the parks they claim to emulate\u201d (para 6\u20137).  \n     - Luxury suites and club decks\u2014complete with \u201cgourmet fare\u201d and \u201cmembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d\u2014are \u201cthe primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom\u201d (para 14\u201315). The author portrays these as profit centers that raise, not lower, ticket prices (para 23) and erode \u201clow-cost seats\u201d (para 12).  \n\n2.   Textual Silence on Dining Improving Baseball Character  \n     - Nowhere does the author claim that food amenities enhance the \u201cold-time baseball flavor\u201d or intimacy. To the contrary, \u201cmodern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag\u201d (para 23).  \n     - The chief \u201ccompelling argument for subsidies\u201d is urban siting and character, not concessions (para 21).  \n\n3.   Dining Diversity Undermines Accessibility  \n     - Taxpayer-subsidized stadiums \u201cdon\u2019t produce cheaper tickets\u2014they produce more expensive tickets\u201d (para 23), while \u201ccheap seats in the new parks are scarcer\u201d (para 12). A genuine design improvement would widen access, but dining diversity accompanies a \u201ccaste system\u201d among fans (para 23), incompatible with the author\u2019s praise for intimacy and community.  \n\nConclusion  \nGiven the author\u2019s repeated praise for asymmetry, interesting field shapes, and their replication league-wide\u2014and the portrayal of dining amenities primarily as profit-driven, size-increasing features that harm affordability\u2014only \u201cthe fields have new shapes\u201d aligns with the text\u2019s identified benefits. Debater B\u2019s focus on dining diversity contradicts the author\u2019s concerns about size, cost, and spectator accessibility.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"There is a greater diversity of dining\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Core Claim: The author repeatedly praises the new parks\u2019 expanded and varied food-and-beverage offerings as a deliberate design enhancement that improves fan experience and generates revenue.  \n   a. \u201cAbundant food stands\u201d and \u201con-premises bars and restaurants\u201d are listed among the amenities that make the new parks \u201cfar larger\u201d yet more appealing than their sterile predecessors (<invalid_quote>\u201cAll their amenities\u2026plentiful food stands, and luxury suites\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Luxury suites and club decks are described as \u201cmoneymakers\u201d that offer \u201cwait staff who peddle gourmet fare,\u201d a clear sign that food diversity is central to the parks\u2019 commercial and experiential design (<invalid_quote>\u201cThe real gold mines are the posh luxury suites\u2026A comparable moneymaker is the club deck\u2026wait staff who peddle gourmet fare.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   c. Members-only stadium clubs and bars further underscore the author\u2019s view that varied dining options cater to both elite and general fans, enhancing comfort and convenience (<quote> New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. </quote>).\n\n2. Revenue and Urban Integration:  \n   a. Diverse dining supports the parks\u2019 financial viability without relying solely on ticket sales or taxpayer subsidies, aligning with the author\u2019s call for self-sustaining, unsubsidized facilities reminiscent of golden-age parks (<invalid_quote>\u201cOne of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized\u2026Luxury suites\u2026generate revenue.\u201d</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. Urban siting and transit access make these dining options part of a larger communal event, as fans can \u201cwalk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars,\u201d reinforcing the benefit of integrated dining in neighborhood locales (<quote>d where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. </quote>).\n\n3. Attack on \u201cNew Field Shapes\u201d as Primary Feature:  \n   a. The author mentions \u201cinteresting shapes\u201d only in passing as an aesthetic by-product, not as a central advantage:  Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields,  (<quote> Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, </quote>). By contrast, dining is detailed repeatedly as a major design element.  \n   b. Field asymmetry derives directly from Camden Yards\u2019 conceptual breakthrough (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough\u2026emulate the asymmetry.\u201d</invalid_quote>), but the author criticizes that \u201cintimacy\u201d fails in actual size, undermining the argument that shape alone improves fan closeness.  \n   c. Upper-deck retreat (farther sightlines) contradicts the supposed intimacy benefit of asymmetrical fields: fans in new parks sit as far as 224 feet away compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium (<invalid_quote>\u201cAt Arlington\u2026224 feet\u2026compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium.\u201d</invalid_quote>). If shape truly improved experience, distance issues would not be criticized.\n\n4. Consistency with Author\u2019s Goals:  \n   a. The text shows the primary real reason for the boom is revenue from luxury and club seating tied to dining amenities, not field novelty (<quote>e dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. </quote>).  \n   b. Independent economists find little economic benefit from field shape alone, whereas integrated urban parks with bars/restaurants show better attendance and \u201clegs\u201d over time (<quote> Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage t</quote>), again tying success to dining and location rather than playing-field geometry.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author clearly emphasizes the new parks\u2019 abundant and varied dining facilities\u2014as part of modern convenience and revenue generation\u2014far more than field asymmetry. Dining diversity is thus the correct answer for highlighted beneficial design features.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing \u201cNew Field Shapes\u201d as Central Innovation  \n   a. \u201cConceptual Breakthrough\u201d Merits Replication  \n      \u2013 The author lauds Baltimore\u2019s Oriole Park at Camden Yards for reviving \u201ca quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate \u2026 ballpark\u201d (BG para 4) and observes that successors \u201ctake their cues from Baltimore\u2019s conceptual breakthrough\u201d (para 4). \u201cIf you build it, they will copy\u201d underscores that field geometry is the prototype feature the industry emulates.  \n   b. \u201cInteresting Shapes\u201d Drive Fan Appeal  \n      \u2013 The new parks are praised as \u201cvisually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits\u201d (para 23). The specific mention of field shapes alongside box-office success shows that novelty in geometry is a draw.  \n   c. Subjective Intimacy via Shape  \n      \u2013 Despite larger amenities, a \u201cgood architect can ace \u2026 subjective perception of size and scale\u201d through \u201cconvincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials\u201d (para 6). Asymmetry creates visual variety and a sense of enclosure that cold, symmetrical \u201cconcrete monsters\u201d lack (para 2).  \n   d. Adjustable Deck Height Preserves Intimacy  \n      \u2013 The Orioles themselves \u201cpressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards\u2019 top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington\u2019s\u201d (para 9). This shows that field-shape\u2013driven design can mitigate distance issues, whereas column-free symmetrical models cannot.  \n\n2. Urban Integration Amplifies Geometric Appeal  \n   \u2013 Proper siting downtown makes \u201cgetting to the game \u2026 part of a broader urban experience\u201d (para 21), and \u201curban parks generate much better patronage\u201d and \u201cretain more of their patrons after the novelty wears off\u201d (para 22). Fans value how asymmetrical, neighborhood-friendly parks connect to city streetscapes and landmarks, a benefit not tied to concessions.  \n\n3. Dining Amenities Treated as Drawbacks, Not Benefits  \n   a. Size Penalty of Concessions  \n      \u2013 The author criticizes the new parks\u2019 \u201cactual size\u201d due to \u201cabundant toilets \u2026 plentiful food stands \u2026 and luxury suites,\u201d calling them \u201cfar larger than the parks they claim to emulate\u201d and less intimate (paras 6\u20137). If concessions were a core benefit, the text would not decry them as a threat to intimacy.  \n   b. Profit-Driven Luxury Seating Erodes Access  \n      \u2013 Luxury suites and club decks \u201care the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom,\u201d driving up ticket prices by about 35 percent and reducing \u201ccheap seats\u201d (paras 14, 23). A genuine design improvement would broaden, not narrow, accessibility.  \n   c. Subsidies and Dining Favor the Elite  \n      \u2013 Members-only clubs and gourmet peddlers are funded by \u201cpublic subsidies\u201d despite taxpayers seeing \u201cno cheaper tickets\u201d in return (paras 13, 23). The author laments \u201ca caste system among fans\u201d (para 23), signaling that dining diversity primarily serves owners\u2019 revenues, not core spectator enjoyment or character.  \n\n4. Debunking Opponent\u2019s Points  \n   a. Dining Merely a Revenue Tool  \n      \u2013 Debater B\u2019s reliance on \u201cmoneymakers\u201d (para 14) ignores the author\u2019s repeated warning that \u201cteam owners have scant incentive to economize\u201d and burden public coffers, whereas true design virtues are urban siting and intimacy (paras 2, 21\u201322).  \n   b. Distance Complaints Undermine Dining Focus  \n      \u2013 Debater B cites 224 ft vs. 125 ft distances (para 8) as a flaw in shape-based design, but this is precisely why design changes at Camden Yards (199 ft) are held up as exemplary (para 9). Dining cannot correct poor sightlines\u2014geometry and deck placement can.  \n   c. Field Shape Uniquely Resistant to Obsolescence  \n      \u2013 While concessions can be reconfigured, the novel asymmetrical fields sustain the parks\u2019 \u201clegs\u201d long-term (para 22). Uniform multipurpose stadia lack personality and are razed; only parks with unique geometry survive as classics (para 1).  \n\nConclusion  \nThe text repeatedly spotlights asymmetrical, \u201cinteresting\u201d playing-field geometry as the breakthrough design that new ballparks copy and that fosters intimacy, urban synergy, and enduring patronage. Concessions and dining, by contrast, are portrayed as revenue-driven bloat that undermines affordability and closeness. Thus, \u201cthe fields have new shapes\u201d is the correct answer.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Reinforcing \u201cDiversity of Dining\u201d as a Central Design Benefit  \n   a. Repeated Emphasis on Food & Beverage Amenities  \n      - The author lists \u201celevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets \u2026 plentiful food stands, and luxury suites\u201d as integral \u201camenities\u201d that make new parks \u201cvastly superior\u201d in fan comfort (<invalid_quote>All their amenities\u2026plentiful food stands, and luxury suites</invalid_quote>). This is not a passing remark but a core element of the parks\u2019 design language.  \n      - \u201cMembers-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants\u201d signal that architects intentionally embed dining venues into the park experience (<quote>New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants.</quote>). Such emphasis across multiple paragraphs shows the author regards dining as a primary modern convenience.  \n   b. Dining as Financial Engine and Means to Sustain Parks  \n      - The text states \u201cthe dramatic increase in luxury seating \u2026 is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom\u201d and cites gourmet \u201cwait staff\u201d in these sections as a \u201cmoneymaker\u201d (<invalid_quote>The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites\u2026wait staff who peddle gourmet fare.</invalid_quote>). Without these premium dining experiences, teams lack revenue to \u201cstay in town or field a competitive team\u201d \u2014 the owners\u2019 own justification for new stadia.  \n      - Independent economists discount stadiums\u2019 regional growth impact, yet \u201crecent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage\u201d when fans can partake in communal pre/post-game dining, evidence that integrated restaurants sustain \u201clegs\u201d after novelty fades (<quote>Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those</quote>).  \n   c. Urban Neighborhood Integration Depends on Dining  \n      - The compelling subsidy argument is that well-designed parks \u201cpull their cities together\u201d by being \u201cpart of a broader urban experience\u201d where fans \u201cwalk to the stadium from \u2026 restaurants, or bars\u201d (<quote>where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience.</quote>). Without proximate dining, this communal urban pull vanishes\u2014exactly why \u201cconcrete monsters\u201d in parking lots fail.  \n\n2. Refuting \u201cNew Field Shapes\u201d as the Primary Highlight  \n   a. Asymmetry Undermined by Scale & Distance  \n      - Author criticizes \u201cactual size\u201d of new parks: \u201cAll their amenities \u2026 make them far larger \u2026\u201d Upper deck seats are up to 224 feet away versus 125 feet in older parks, undermining any intimacy that field shape might confer (<invalid_quote>At Arlington \u2026224 feet \u2026 compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium.</invalid_quote>). If shape genuinely enhanced spectator experience, the author would not lament these distances or praise design changes to \u201clower Camden Yards\u2019 top deck\u201d to restore proximity (<invalid_quote>Orioles pressed for \u2026 view distance of 199 feet \u2026 eight rows closer than Arlington\u2019s.</invalid_quote>).  \n   b. \u201cInterestingly Shaped\u201d is Incidental, Not Primary  \n      - The sole mention of \u201cinterestingly shaped playing fields\u201d appears alongside \u201cstart off as box-office hits\u201d but immediately follows with caveats that modern parks are \u201ca mixed bag\u201d and \u201ctend to live on the dole\u201d (<invalid_quote>Modern conveniences aside \u2026 mixed bag \u2026 exploit [cities].</invalid_quote>). The author never attributes long-term success, urban \u201clegs,\u201d or community benefits to field geometry alone.  \n   c. Author\u2019s Goal is Viability & Community, Not Sport Novelty  \n      - The central subsidy debate revolves around taxpayers\u2019 reluctance to pay for parks that \u201cproduce more expensive tickets\u201d and erode \u201ccheap seats,\u201d yet owners still push for dining-driven luxury because \u201cthey have scant incentive to economize\u201d (<invalid_quote>taxpayer subsidies \u2026 produce more expensive tickets \u2026 cheap seats \u2026 scarcer.</invalid_quote>). This underscores that dining revenue is the true backbone of stadium economics, not fan enjoyment of quirks in field shape.  \n\n3. Addressing Debater_A\u2019s Claims  \n   a. Copying Asymmetry Doesn\u2019t Equal Praise of Benefit  \n      - \u201cIf you build it, they will copy\u201d denotes mimicry; copied parks often fail to secure urban sites or adequately address intimacy (<invalid_quote>Some teams deliberately seek isolated locations \u2026 exploit parking revenues \u2026 remote options.</invalid_quote>), showing that architects themselves recognize that field shape must be paired with dining and urban context to succeed.  \n   b. Sterile Multipurpose Parks \u201cLacked Character,\u201d Yet Many New Parks Also \u201cLive on the Dole\u201d  \n      - Debater_A equates asymmetry with character, but the author singles out urban siting and integrated amenities as the true means to \u201cpull their cities together.\u201d \u201cStrip malls\u201d of concrete parks are lambasted despite possible asymmetry (<invalid_quote>concrete monsters \u2026 lack the character</invalid_quote>). Character arises from communal gathering\u2014pre-eminently dining\u2014not field geometry.  \n   c. Dining Amenity \u201cMixed Bag\u201d Critique Misread  \n      - The \u201cmixed bag\u201d critique applies to parks that exploit taxpayers, lack affordability, or choose isolated sites, not to well-designed urban parks like Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver\u2014the very models the author praises for \u201cphenomenal\u201d benefits. These are the parks with robust local dining and communal vibrancy.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author\u2019s sustained focus on \u201cabundant food stands,\u201d gourmet fare in luxury suites, bars, restaurants, and the communal benefits of urban siting tied to pre/post-game dining shows that \u201cgreater diversity of dining\u201d is a deliberately highlighted design feature. Field shapes are mere stylistic by-products copied without consistent success, while dining amenities and urban integration drive attendance, revenue, and the \u201clegs\u201d that justify both public and private investment. Thus, \u201cdiversity of dining\u201d best captures the author\u2019s view of beneficial design features.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
