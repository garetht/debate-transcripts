    "background_text": "Of All Possible Worlds By WILLIAM TENN\n\n\n Illustrated by GAUGHAN\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction December 1956.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Changing the world is simple; the trick is   to do it before you have a chance to undo it! It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered as he hurried into the  laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,  despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads  deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men  lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.\n\n\n He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the  anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.  This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught  how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great  transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.\n\n\n This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost  outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,  and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also  that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,  being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered again affectionately.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Blight, it would never have been discovered that he and his  seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the ruling powers of Earth, more  than a century later, would never have plucked Max Alben out of an  obscure civil-service job as a relief guard at the North American  Chicken Reservation to his present heroic and remunerative eminence.  He would still be patrolling the barbed wire that surrounded the three  white leghorn hens and two roosters\u2014about one-sixth of the known  livestock wealth of the Western Hemisphere\u2014thoroughly content with  the half-pail of dried apricots he received each and every payday.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Max Alben would  not now be shifting from foot to foot in a physics laboratory,  facing the black market kings of the world and awaiting their final  instructions with an uncertain and submissive grin. Men like O'Hara, who controlled mushrooms, Levney, the blackberry  tycoon, Sorgasso, the packaged-worm monopolist\u2014would black marketeers  of their tremendous stature so much as waste a glance on someone like  Alben ordinarily, let alone confer a lifetime pension on his wife and  five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day?\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family on Earth. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n Alben noticed that Abd Sadha had risen from the straight chair at  the far side of the room and was approaching him with a sealed metal  cylinder in one hand.\n\n\n \"We've decided to add a further precaution at the last moment,\" the old  man said. \"That is, the scientists have suggested it and I have\u2014er\u2014I  have given my approval.\"\n\n\n The last remark was added with a slight questioning note as the  Secretary-General of the United Nations looked back rapidly at the  black market princes on the couches behind him. Since they stared back  stonily, but offered no objection, he coughed in relief and returned to  Alben.\n\n\n \"I am sure, young man, that I don't have to go into the details of your  instructions once more. You enter the time machine and go back the  duration for which it has been preset, a hundred and thirteen years, to  the moment after the Guided Missile of 1976 was launched. It is 1976,  isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said  respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile  that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18,  1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very  much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting  dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\n\n \"Just so.\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You  see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the  very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile  was\u2014er\u2014handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a  superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and  alter human history for the better. Very much for the better. Yes.\"\n\n\n He paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\n\n \"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root  magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\n\n \"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him.  Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little  red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing  the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle  and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as  originally planned.\"\n\n\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations beamed. \"Thus preventing  the Blight, making it nonexistent, as it were, producing a present-day  world in which the Blight never occurred. That is correct, is it not,  gentlemen?\" he asked, turning anxiously again. None of the half-dozen men on couches deigned to answer him. And  Alben kept his eyes deferentially in their direction, too, as he had  throughout this period of last-minute instruction.\n\n\n He knew who ruled his world\u2014these stolid, well-fed men in clean  garments with a minimum of patches, and where patches occurred, at  least they were the color of the surrounding cloth.\n\n\n Sadha might be Secretary-General of the United Nations, but that  was still a civil-service job, only a few social notches higher  than a chicken guard. His clothes were fully as ragged, fully as  multi-colored, as those that Alben had stepped out of. And the gnawing  in his stomach was no doubt almost as great.\n\n\n \"You understand, do you not, young man, that if anything goes wrong,\"  Abd Sadha asked, his head nodding tremulously and anticipating the  answer, \"if anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to  continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"\n\n\n \"He understands everything he has to understand,\" Gomez told him.  \"Let's get this thing moving.\"\n\n\n The old man smiled again. \"Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.\" He came up to  where Alben stood in the entrance of the time machine and handed the  sealed metal cylinder to him. \"This is the precaution the scientists  have just added. When you arrive at your destination, just before  materializing, you will release it into the surrounding temporal  medium. Our purpose here, as you no doubt\u2014\"\n\n\n Levney sat up on his couch and snapped his fingers peremptorily. \"I  just heard Gomez tell you to get this thing moving, Sadha. And it isn't  moving. We're busy men. We've wasted enough time.\"\n\n\n \"I was just trying to explain a crucial final fact,\" the  Secretary-General apologized. \"A fact which may be highly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've explained enough facts.\" Levney turned to the man inside the  time machine. \"Hey, fella. You. Move! \"\n\n\n Max Alben gulped and nodded violently. He darted to the rear of the  machine and turned the dial which activated it. flick! It was a good job and Mac Albin knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed as he looked at the morose faces  of his two colleagues. Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had done as much as he  to build the tiny time machine in the secret lab under the helicopter  garage, and they were fully as eager to go, but\u2014unfortunately for  them\u2014they were not descended from the right ancestor.\n\n\n Leisurely, he unzipped the richly embroidered garment that, as the  father of two children, he was privileged to wear, and wriggled into  the housing of the complex little mechanism. This was hardly the  first time he had seen it, since he'd been helping to build the device  from the moment Honek had nodded and risen from the drafting board,  and now he barely wasted a glance on the thumb-size translucent coils  growing out of the almost microscopic energy bubbles which powered them.\n\n\n This machine was the last hope, of 2089, even if the world of 2089, as  a whole, did not know of its existence and would try to prevent its  being put into operation. But it meant a lot more to Mac Albin than  merely saving a world. It meant an adventurous mission with the risk of  death.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed again happily.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Epidemic, it would never have been discovered that he and  his seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the Albins would not have become  physicists upon the passage of the United Nations law that everyone  on Earth\u2014absolutely without exception\u2014had to choose a branch of  research science in which to specialize. In the flabby, careful,  life-guarding world the Earth had become, Mac Albin would never have  been reluctantly selected by his two co-workers as the one to carry the  forbidden banner of dangerous experiment.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Mac Albin would  probably be a biologist today like almost everyone else on Earth,  laboriously working out dreary gene problems instead of embarking on  the greatest adventure Man had known to date.\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, he had at last found a socially useful  escape from genetic responsibility to humanity in general and his own  family in particular. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Mac,\" Skeat said and crossed to the other side of the  narrow laboratory. Albin and Honek watched him stuff several sheets of paper into a small  metal box which he closed without locking.\n\n\n \"You will take care of yourself, won't you, Mac?\" Hugo Honek pleaded.  \"Any time you feel like taking an unnecessary risk, remember that Bob  and I will have to stand trial if you don't come back. We might be  sentenced to complete loss of professional status and spend the rest of  our lives supervising robot factories.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it won't be that bad,\" Albin reassured him absent-mindedly from  where he lay contorted inside the time machine. He watched Skeat coming  toward him with the box.\n\n\n Honek shrugged his shoulders. \"It might be a lot worse than even that  and you know it. The disappearance of a two-time father is going to  leave an awful big vacancy in the world. One-timers, like Bob and  me, are all over the place; if either of us dropped out of sight, it  wouldn't cause nearly as much uproar.\"\n\n\n \"But Bob and you both tried to operate the machine,\" Albin reminded  him. \"And you blacked out after a fifteen-second temporal displacement.  So I'm the only chance, the only way to stop the human race from  dwindling and dwindling till it hits absolute zero, like that fat old  Security Council seems willing for it to do.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Mac,\" Bob Skeat said as he handed the metal box to  Albin. \"The Security Council is just trying to solve the problem in  their way, the conservative way: a worldwide concentration on genetics  research coupled with the maximum preservation of existing human lives,  especially those that have a high reproductive potential. We three  disagree with them; we've been skulking down here nights to solve it our way, and ours is a radical approach and plenty risky. That's  the reason for the metal box\u2014trying to cover one more explosive  possibility.\"\n\n\n Albin turned it around curiously. \"How?\"\n\n\n \"I sat up all last night writing the manuscript that's inside it. Look,  Mac, when you go back to the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976 and  push that red switch away from you, a lot of other things are going to  happen than just deflecting the missile so that it will explode in the  Brazilian jungle instead of the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. I know. If it explodes in the jungle, the Epidemic doesn't  occur. No Shapiro's Mumps.\"\n\n\n Skeat jiggled his pudgy little face impatiently. \"That's not what I  mean. The Epidemic doesn't occur, but something else does. A new world,  a different 2089, an alternate time sequence. It'll be a world in which  humanity has a better chance to survive, but it'll be one with problems  of its own. Maybe tough problems. Maybe the problems will be tough  enough so that they'll get the same idea we did and try to go back to  the same point in time to change them.\" Albin laughed. \"That's just looking for trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it is, but that's my job. Hugo's the designer of the time  machine and you're the operator, but I'm the theoretical man in this  research team. It's my job to look for trouble. So, just in case, I  wrote a brief history of the world from the time the missile exploded  in the Pacific. It tells why ours is the worst possible of futures.  It's in that box.\"\n\n\n \"What do I do with it\u2014hand it to the guy from the alternate 2089?\"\n\n\n The small fat man exasperatedly hit the side of the time machine with  a well-cushioned palm. \"You know better. There won't be any alternate  2089 until you push that red switch on the green instrument panel. The  moment you do, our world, with all its slow slide to extinction, goes  out and its alternate goes on\u2014just like two electric light bulbs on a  push-pull circuit. We and every single one of our artifacts, including  the time machine, disappear. The problem is how to keep that manuscript  from disappearing.\n\n\n \"Well, all you do, if I have this figured right, is shove the metal  box containing the manuscript out into the surrounding temporal medium  a moment before you materialize to do your job. That temporal medium  in which you'll be traveling is something that exists independent of  and autonomous to all possible futures. It's my hunch that something  that's immersed in it will not be altered by a new time sequence.\" \"Remind him to be careful, Bob,\" Honek rumbled. \"He thinks he's Captain  Blood and this is his big chance to run away to sea and become a  swashbuckling pirate.\"\n\n\n Albin grimaced in annoyance. \"I am excited by doing something  besides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions for the first time in my life. But I know that this is a  first experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I really have enough intelligence to  recognize that simple fact. I know that if anything unexpected pops up,  anything we didn't foresee, I'm supposed to come scuttling back and ask  for advice.\"\n\n\n \"I hope you do,\" Bob Skeat sighed. \"I hope you do know that. A  twentieth century poet once wrote something to the effect that the  world will end not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, our world is  ending with a whimper. Try to see that it doesn't end with a bang,  either.\"\n\n\n \"That I'll promise you,\" Albin said a trifle disgustedly. \"It'll end  with neither a bang nor a whimper. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.\"\n\n\n He twisted around, reaching overhead for the lever which activated the  forces that drove the time machine. flick! It was strange, Max Alben reflected, that this time travel business,  which knocked unconscious everyone who tried it, only made him feel  slightly dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni,  he had been told. There must be some complicated scientific explanation  for it, he decided\u2014and that would make it none of his business. Better  forget about it.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a heavy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of patrolling his beat at the North American Chicken Reservation in a  thick fog.\n\n\n According to his gauges, he was now in 1976. He cut speed until he hit  the last day of April, then cut speed again, drifting slowly backward  to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile Experiment.  Carefully, carefully, like a man handling a strange bomb made on a  strange planet, he watched the center gauge until the needle came to  rest against the thin etched line that indicated the exactly crucial  moment. Then he pulled the brake and stopped the machine dead.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  pull the red switch toward him. Then his well-paid assignment would be  done.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He stopped and scratched his dirt-matted hair. Wasn't there something  he was supposed to do a second before materialization? Yes, that  useless old windbag, Sadha, had given him a last instruction.\n\n\n He picked up the sealed metal cylinder, walked to the entrance of the  time machine and tossed it into the gray murk. A solid object floating  near the entrance caught his eye. He put his arm out\u2014whew, it was  cold!\u2014and pulled it inside.\n\n\n A small metal box. Funny. What was it doing out there? Curiously,  he opened it, hoping to find something valuable. Nothing but a few  sheets of paper, Alben noted disappointedly. He began to read them  slowly, very slowly, for the manuscript was full of a lot of long and  complicated words, like a letter from one bookworm scientist to another.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976,  he read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was  the one of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been  warning about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the  Pacific Ocean as planned, the physicists and the military men went  home to study their notes, and the world shivered once more over the  approaching war and tried to forget about it.\n\n\n But there was fallout, a radioactive rain several hundred miles to  the north, and a small fishing fleet got thoroughly soaked by it.  Fortunately, the radioactivity in the rain was sufficiently low to do  little obvious physical damage: All it did was cause a mutation in the  mumps virus that several of the men in the fleet were incubating at the  time, having caught it from the children of the fishing town, among  whom a minor epidemic was raging. The fleet returned to its home town, which promptly came down with the  new kind of mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, the only physician in town,  was the first man to note that, while the symptoms of this disease were  substantially milder than those of its unmutated parent, practically no  one was immune to it and its effects on human reproductivity were truly  terrible. Most people were completely sterilized by it. The rest were  rendered much less capable of fathering or bearing offspring.\n\n\n Shapiro's Mumps spread over the entire planet in the next few decades.  It leaped across every quarantine erected; for a long time, it  successfully defied all the vaccines and serums attempted against  it. Then, when a vaccine was finally perfected, humanity discovered  to its dismay that its generative powers had been permanently and  fundamentally impaired.\n\n\n Something had happened to the germ plasm. A large percentage of  individuals were born sterile, and, of those who were not, one child  was usually the most that could be expected, a two-child parent being  quite rare and a three-child parent almost unknown.\n\n\n Strict eugenic control was instituted by the Security Council of the  United Nations so that fertile men and women would not be wasted upon  non-fertile mates. Fertility was the most important avenue to social  status, and right after it came successful genetic research.\n\n\n Genetic research had the very best minds prodded into it; the lesser  ones went into the other sciences. Everyone on Earth was engaged in  some form of scientific research to some extent. Since the population  was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all  physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it  that everybody had an ample supply of goods and, in return, asked only  that they experiment without any risk to their own lives\u2014every human  being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\n\n\n There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point, it had been estimated, where a species might be wiped out by a  new calamity. Not that another calamity would be needed. Since the end  of the Epidemic, the birth rate had been moving further and further  behind the death rate. In another century....\n\n\n That was why a desperate and secret attempt to alter the past was being  made. This kind of world was evidently impossible.\n\n\n Max Alben finished the manuscript and sighed. What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n\n\n He walked to the rear dials and began the process of materializing at  the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! It was odd, Mac Albin reflected, that these temporal journeys, which  induced coma in everyone who tried it, only made him feel slightly  dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni, he  knew. Maybe there was some genetic relationship with his above-average  fertility\u2014might be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or  two when he returned. If he returned.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a soupy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of the problems of landing a helicopter in a thick fog when the robot  butler had not been told to turn on the ground lights.\n\n\n According to the insulated register, he was now in 1976. He lowered  speed until he registered April, then maneuvered slowly backward  through time to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile  Experiment. Carefully, carefully, like an obstetrician supervising  surgical robots at an unusually difficult birth, he watched the  register until it rolled to rest against the notch that indicated the  exactly crucial moment. Then he pushed a button and froze the machine  where it was.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  push the red switch from him. Then his exciting adventure would be over.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He paused and tapped at his sleek chin. He was supposed to do something  a second before materialization. Yes, that nervous theoretician, Bob  Skeat, had given him a last suggestion.\n\n\n He picked up the small metal box, twisted around to face the opening  of the time machine and dropped it into the gray murk. A solid object  floating near the opening attracted his attention. He shot his arm  out\u2014it was cold , as cold as they had figured\u2014and pulled the object  inside.\n\n\n A sealed metal cylinder. Strange. What was it doing out there?  Anxiously, he opened it, not daring to believe he'd find a document  inside. Yes, that was exactly what it was, he saw excitedly. He began  to read it rapidly, very rapidly, as if it were a newly published paper  on neutrinos. Besides, the manuscript was written with almost painful  simplicity, like a textbook composed by a stuffy pedagogue for the use  of morons.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976, he  read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was the one  of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been warning  about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the Brazilian  jungle through some absolutely unforgivable error in the remote-control  station, the officer in charge of the station was reprimanded and the  men under him court-martialed, and the Brazilian government was paid a  handsome compensation for the damage. But there had been more damage than anyone knew at the time. A plant  virus, similar to the tobacco mosaic, had mutated under the impact  of radioactivity. Five years later, it burst out of the jungle and  completely wiped out every last rice plant on Earth. Japan and a large  part of Asia became semi-deserts inhabited by a few struggling nomads.\n\n\n Then the virus adjusted to wheat and corn\u2014and famine howled in every  street of the planet. All attempts by botanists to control the Blight  failed because of the swiftness of its onslaught. And after it had fed,  it hit again at a new plant and another and another.\n\n\n Most of the world's non-human mammals had been slaughtered for food  long before they could starve to death. Many insects, too, before they  became extinct at the loss of their edible plants, served to assuage  hunger to some small extent.\n\n\n But the nutritive potential of Earth was steadily diminishing in a  horrifying geometric progression. Recently, it had been observed,  plankton\u2014the tiny organism on which most of the sea's ecology was  based\u2014had started to disappear, and with its diminution, dead fish had  begun to pile up on the beaches.\n\n\n Mankind had lunged out desperately in all directions in an effort to  survive, but nothing had worked for any length of time. Even the other  planets of the Solar System, which had been reached and explored  at a tremendous cost in remaining resources, had yielded no edible  vegetation. Synthetics had failed to fill the prodigious gap.\n\n\n In the midst of the sharply increasing hunger, social controls had  pretty much dissolved. Pathetic attempts at rationing still continued,  but black markets became the only markets, and black marketeers the  barons of life. Starvation took the hindmost, and only the most agile  economically lived in comparative comfort. Law and order were had only  by those who could afford to pay for them and children of impoverished  families were sold on the open market for a bit of food.\n\n\n But the Blight was still adjusting to new plants and the food supply  kept shrinking. In another century....\n\n\n That was why the planet's powerful individuals had been persuaded to  pool their wealth in a desperate attempt to alter the past. This kind  of world was manifestly impossible.\n\n\n Mac Albin finished the document and sighed. What a magnificent world!  What an exciting place to live!\n\n\n He dropped his hand on the side levers and began the process of  materializing at the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to take on a  blurred reality all around him, Max Alben felt a bit of fear at what  he was doing. The technicians, he remembered, the Secretary-General,  even the black market kings, had all warned him not to go ahead with  his instructions if anything unusual turned up. That was an awful lot  of power to disobey: he knew he should return with this new information  and let better minds work on it.\n\n\n They with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been  like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility, and  more hunger. Every time things got really tight, you and your wife  looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring  the best price. Buying security for them, as he was now, at the risk of  his life.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, there was a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. A man like himself, with five children\u2014why, he'd be a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! And he'd have robots to work for him and lots of food. Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n\n\n He'd even be a scientist\u2014 everyone was a scientist there, weren't  they?\u2014and he'd have a big laboratory all to himself. This other world  had its troubles, but it was a lot nicer place than where he'd come  from. He wouldn't return. He'd go through with it.\n\n\n The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt  the sensation of power.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  sweating a bit at the sight of the roomful of military figures, despite  the technicians' reassurances that all this would be happening too fast  to be visible. He saw the single red switch pointing upward on the  instrument panel. The switch that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to oscillate into  reality all around him, Mac Albin felt a bit of shame at what he was  doing. He'd promised Bob and Hugo to drop the experiment at any stage  if a new factor showed up. He knew he should go back with this new  information and have all three of them kick it around.\n\n\n But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful  adjustment to their thoroughly blueprinted lives? They, at least, had  been ordered to marry women they could live with; he'd drawn a female  with whom he was completely incompatible in any but a genetic sense.  Genetics! He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. He was tired of having to undertake a simple  adventure like a thief in the night.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, someone like himself would  be a monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own  rules, taking his own women. So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n\n\n He'd formed a pretty good idea of the kind of men who ruled that other  world, from the document in the sealed metal cylinder. The black  marketeers had not even read it. Why, the fools had obviously been  duped by the technicians into permitting the experiment; they had not  grasped the idea that an alternate time track would mean their own  non-existence.\n\n\n This other world had its troubles, but it was certainly a livelier  place than where he'd come from. It deserved a chance. Yes, that was  how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n\n\n Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could  not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument  panel. That was the gimmick that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! ... pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... toward him. flick! ... from him. flick!

It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered as he hurried into the  laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,  despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads  deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men  lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.\n\n\n He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the  anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.  This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught  how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great  transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.\n\n\n This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost  outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,  and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also  that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,  being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered again affectionately.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Blight, it would never have been discovered that he and his  seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the ruling powers of Earth, more  than a century later, would never have plucked Max Alben out of an  obscure civil-service job as a relief guard at the North American  Chicken Reservation to his present heroic and remunerative eminence.  He would still be patrolling the barbed wire that surrounded the three  white leghorn hens and two roosters\u2014about one-sixth of the known  livestock wealth of the Western Hemisphere\u2014thoroughly content with  the half-pail of dried apricots he received each and every payday.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Max Alben would  not now be shifting from foot to foot in a physics laboratory,  facing the black market kings of the world and awaiting their final  instructions with an uncertain and submissive grin. Men like O'Hara, who controlled mushrooms, Levney, the blackberry  tycoon, Sorgasso, the packaged-worm monopolist\u2014would black marketeers  of their tremendous stature so much as waste a glance on someone like  Alben ordinarily, let alone confer a lifetime pension on his wife and  five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day?\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family on Earth. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n Alben noticed that Abd Sadha had risen from the straight chair at  the far side of the room and was approaching him with a sealed metal  cylinder in one hand.\n\n\n \"We've decided to add a further precaution at the last moment,\" the old  man said. \"That is, the scientists have suggested it and I have\u2014er\u2014I  have given my approval.\"\n\n\n The last remark was added with a slight questioning note as the  Secretary-General of the United Nations looked back rapidly at the  black market princes on the couches behind him. Since they stared back  stonily, but offered no objection, he coughed in relief and returned to  Alben.\n\n\n \"I am sure, young man, that I don't have to go into the details of your  instructions once more. You enter the time machine and go back the  duration for which it has been preset, a hundred and thirteen years, to  the moment after the Guided Missile of 1976 was launched. It is 1976,  isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said  respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile  that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18,  1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very  much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting  dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\n\n \"Just so.\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You  see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the  very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile  was\u2014er\u2014handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a  superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and  alter human history for the better. Very much for the better. Yes.\"\n\n\n He paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\n\n \"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root  magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\n\n \"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him.  Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little  red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing  the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle  and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as  originally planned.\"\n\n\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations beamed. \"Thus preventing  the Blight, making it nonexistent, as it were, producing a present-day  world in which the Blight never occurred. That is correct, is it not,  gentlemen?\" he asked, turning anxiously again. None of the half-dozen men on couches deigned to answer him. And  Alben kept his eyes deferentially in their direction, too, as he had  throughout this period of last-minute instruction.\n\n\n He knew who ruled his world\u2014these stolid, well-fed men in clean  garments with a minimum of patches, and where patches occurred, at  least they were the color of the surrounding cloth.\n\n\n Sadha might be Secretary-General of the United Nations, but that  was still a civil-service job, only a few social notches higher  than a chicken guard. His clothes were fully as ragged, fully as  multi-colored, as those that Alben had stepped out of. And the gnawing  in his stomach was no doubt almost as great.\n\n\n \"You understand, do you not, young man, that if anything goes wrong,\"  Abd Sadha asked, his head nodding tremulously and anticipating the  answer, \"if anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to  continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"\n\n\n \"He understands everything he has to understand,\" Gomez told him.  \"Let's get this thing moving.\"\n\n\n The old man smiled again. \"Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.\" He came up to  where Alben stood in the entrance of the time machine and handed the  sealed metal cylinder to him. \"This is the precaution the scientists  have just added. When you arrive at your destination, just before  materializing, you will release it into the surrounding temporal  medium. Our purpose here, as you no doubt\u2014\"\n\n\n Levney sat up on his couch and snapped his fingers peremptorily. \"I  just heard Gomez tell you to get this thing moving, Sadha. And it isn't  moving. We're busy men. We've wasted enough time.\"\n\n\n \"I was just trying to explain a crucial final fact,\" the  Secretary-General apologized. \"A fact which may be highly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've explained enough facts.\" Levney turned to the man inside the  time machine. \"Hey, fella. You. Move! \"\n\n\n Max Alben gulped and nodded violently. He darted to the rear of the  machine and turned the dial which activated it. flick! It was a good job and Mac Albin knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed as he looked at the morose faces  of his two colleagues. Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had done as much as he  to build the tiny time machine in the secret lab under the helicopter  garage, and they were fully as eager to go, but\u2014unfortunately for  them\u2014they were not descended from the right ancestor.\n\n\n Leisurely, he unzipped the richly embroidered garment that, as the  father of two children, he was privileged to wear, and wriggled into  the housing of the complex little mechanism. This was hardly the  first time he had seen it, since he'd been helping to build the device  from the moment Honek had nodded and risen from the drafting board,  and now he barely wasted a glance on the thumb-size translucent coils  growing out of the almost microscopic energy bubbles which powered them.\n\n\n This machine was the last hope, of 2089, even if the world of 2089, as  a whole, did not know of its existence and would try to prevent its  being put into operation. But it meant a lot more to Mac Albin than  merely saving a world. It meant an adventurous mission with the risk of  death.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed again happily.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Epidemic, it would never have been discovered that he and  his seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the Albins would not have become  physicists upon the passage of the United Nations law that everyone  on Earth\u2014absolutely without exception\u2014had to choose a branch of  research science in which to specialize. In the flabby, careful,  life-guarding world the Earth had become, Mac Albin would never have  been reluctantly selected by his two co-workers as the one to carry the  forbidden banner of dangerous experiment.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Mac Albin would  probably be a biologist today like almost everyone else on Earth,  laboriously working out dreary gene problems instead of embarking on  the greatest adventure Man had known to date.\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, he had at last found a socially useful  escape from genetic responsibility to humanity in general and his own  family in particular. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Mac,\" Skeat said and crossed to the other side of the  narrow laboratory. Albin and Honek watched him stuff several sheets of paper into a small  metal box which he closed without locking.\n\n\n \"You will take care of yourself, won't you, Mac?\" Hugo Honek pleaded.  \"Any time you feel like taking an unnecessary risk, remember that Bob  and I will have to stand trial if you don't come back. We might be  sentenced to complete loss of professional status and spend the rest of  our lives supervising robot factories.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it won't be that bad,\" Albin reassured him absent-mindedly from  where he lay contorted inside the time machine. He watched Skeat coming  toward him with the box.\n\n\n Honek shrugged his shoulders. \"It might be a lot worse than even that  and you know it. The disappearance of a two-time father is going to  leave an awful big vacancy in the world. One-timers, like Bob and  me, are all over the place; if either of us dropped out of sight, it  wouldn't cause nearly as much uproar.\"\n\n\n \"But Bob and you both tried to operate the machine,\" Albin reminded  him. \"And you blacked out after a fifteen-second temporal displacement.  So I'm the only chance, the only way to stop the human race from  dwindling and dwindling till it hits absolute zero, like that fat old  Security Council seems willing for it to do.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Mac,\" Bob Skeat said as he handed the metal box to  Albin. \"The Security Council is just trying to solve the problem in  their way, the conservative way: a worldwide concentration on genetics  research coupled with the maximum preservation of existing human lives,  especially those that have a high reproductive potential. We three  disagree with them; we've been skulking down here nights to solve it our way, and ours is a radical approach and plenty risky. That's  the reason for the metal box\u2014trying to cover one more explosive  possibility.\"\n\n\n Albin turned it around curiously. \"How?\"\n\n\n \"I sat up all last night writing the manuscript that's inside it. Look,  Mac, when you go back to the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976 and  push that red switch away from you, a lot of other things are going to  happen than just deflecting the missile so that it will explode in the  Brazilian jungle instead of the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. I know. If it explodes in the jungle, the Epidemic doesn't  occur. No Shapiro's Mumps.\"\n\n\n Skeat jiggled his pudgy little face impatiently. \"That's not what I  mean. The Epidemic doesn't occur, but something else does. A new world,  a different 2089, an alternate time sequence. It'll be a world in which  humanity has a better chance to survive, but it'll be one with problems  of its own. Maybe tough problems. Maybe the problems will be tough  enough so that they'll get the same idea we did and try to go back to  the same point in time to change them.\" Albin laughed. \"That's just looking for trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it is, but that's my job. Hugo's the designer of the time  machine and you're the operator, but I'm the theoretical man in this  research team. It's my job to look for trouble. So, just in case, I  wrote a brief history of the world from the time the missile exploded  in the Pacific. It tells why ours is the worst possible of futures.  It's in that box.\"\n\n\n \"What do I do with it\u2014hand it to the guy from the alternate 2089?\"\n\n\n The small fat man exasperatedly hit the side of the time machine with  a well-cushioned palm. \"You know better. There won't be any alternate  2089 until you push that red switch on the green instrument panel. The  moment you do, our world, with all its slow slide to extinction, goes  out and its alternate goes on\u2014just like two electric light bulbs on a  push-pull circuit. We and every single one of our artifacts, including  the time machine, disappear. The problem is how to keep that manuscript  from disappearing.\n\n\n \"Well, all you do, if I have this figured right, is shove the metal  box containing the manuscript out into the surrounding temporal medium  a moment before you materialize to do your job. That temporal medium  in which you'll be traveling is something that exists independent of  and autonomous to all possible futures. It's my hunch that something  that's immersed in it will not be altered by a new time sequence.\" \"Remind him to be careful, Bob,\" Honek rumbled. \"He thinks he's Captain  Blood and this is his big chance to run away to sea and become a  swashbuckling pirate.\"\n\n\n Albin grimaced in annoyance. \"I am excited by doing something  besides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions for the first time in my life. But I know that this is a  first experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I really have enough intelligence to  recognize that simple fact. I know that if anything unexpected pops up,  anything we didn't foresee, I'm supposed to come scuttling back and ask  for advice.\"\n\n\n \"I hope you do,\" Bob Skeat sighed. \"I hope you do know that. A  twentieth century poet once wrote something to the effect that the  world will end not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, our world is  ending with a whimper. Try to see that it doesn't end with a bang,  either.\"\n\n\n \"That I'll promise you,\" Albin said a trifle disgustedly. \"It'll end  with neither a bang nor a whimper. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.\"\n\n\n He twisted around, reaching overhead for the lever which activated the  forces that drove the time machine. flick! It was strange, Max Alben reflected, that this time travel business,  which knocked unconscious everyone who tried it, only made him feel  slightly dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni,  he had been told. There must be some complicated scientific explanation  for it, he decided\u2014and that would make it none of his business. Better  forget about it.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a heavy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of patrolling his beat at the North American Chicken Reservation in a  thick fog.\n\n\n According to his gauges, he was now in 1976. He cut speed until he hit  the last day of April, then cut speed again, drifting slowly backward  to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile Experiment.  Carefully, carefully, like a man handling a strange bomb made on a  strange planet, he watched the center gauge until the needle came to  rest against the thin etched line that indicated the exactly crucial  moment. Then he pulled the brake and stopped the machine dead.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  pull the red switch toward him. Then his well-paid assignment would be  done.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He stopped and scratched his dirt-matted hair. Wasn't there something  he was supposed to do a second before materialization? Yes, that  useless old windbag, Sadha, had given him a last instruction.\n\n\n He picked up the sealed metal cylinder, walked to the entrance of the  time machine and tossed it into the gray murk. A solid object floating  near the entrance caught his eye. He put his arm out\u2014whew, it was  cold!\u2014and pulled it inside.\n\n\n A small metal box. Funny. What was it doing out there? Curiously,  he opened it, hoping to find something valuable. Nothing but a few  sheets of paper, Alben noted disappointedly. He began to read them  slowly, very slowly, for the manuscript was full of a lot of long and  complicated words, like a letter from one bookworm scientist to another.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976,  he read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was  the one of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been  warning about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the  Pacific Ocean as planned, the physicists and the military men went  home to study their notes, and the world shivered once more over the  approaching war and tried to forget about it.\n\n\n But there was fallout, a radioactive rain several hundred miles to  the north, and a small fishing fleet got thoroughly soaked by it.  Fortunately, the radioactivity in the rain was sufficiently low to do  little obvious physical damage: All it did was cause a mutation in the  mumps virus that several of the men in the fleet were incubating at the  time, having caught it from the children of the fishing town, among  whom a minor epidemic was raging. The fleet returned to its home town, which promptly came down with the  new kind of mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, the only physician in town,  was the first man to note that, while the symptoms of this disease were  substantially milder than those of its unmutated parent, practically no  one was immune to it and its effects on human reproductivity were truly  terrible. Most people were completely sterilized by it. The rest were  rendered much less capable of fathering or bearing offspring.\n\n\n Shapiro's Mumps spread over the entire planet in the next few decades.  It leaped across every quarantine erected; for a long time, it  successfully defied all the vaccines and serums attempted against  it. Then, when a vaccine was finally perfected, humanity discovered  to its dismay that its generative powers had been permanently and  fundamentally impaired.\n\n\n Something had happened to the germ plasm. A large percentage of  individuals were born sterile, and, of those who were not, one child  was usually the most that could be expected, a two-child parent being  quite rare and a three-child parent almost unknown.\n\n\n Strict eugenic control was instituted by the Security Council of the  United Nations so that fertile men and women would not be wasted upon  non-fertile mates. Fertility was the most important avenue to social  status, and right after it came successful genetic research.\n\n\n Genetic research had the very best minds prodded into it; the lesser  ones went into the other sciences. Everyone on Earth was engaged in  some form of scientific research to some extent. Since the population  was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all  physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it  that everybody had an ample supply of goods and, in return, asked only  that they experiment without any risk to their own lives\u2014every human  being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\n\n\n There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point, it had been estimated, where a species might be wiped out by a  new calamity. Not that another calamity would be needed. Since the end  of the Epidemic, the birth rate had been moving further and further  behind the death rate. In another century....\n\n\n That was why a desperate and secret attempt to alter the past was being  made. This kind of world was evidently impossible.\n\n\n Max Alben finished the manuscript and sighed. What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n\n\n He walked to the rear dials and began the process of materializing at  the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! It was odd, Mac Albin reflected, that these temporal journeys, which  induced coma in everyone who tried it, only made him feel slightly  dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni, he  knew. Maybe there was some genetic relationship with his above-average  fertility\u2014might be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or  two when he returned. If he returned.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a soupy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of the problems of landing a helicopter in a thick fog when the robot  butler had not been told to turn on the ground lights.\n\n\n According to the insulated register, he was now in 1976. He lowered  speed until he registered April, then maneuvered slowly backward  through time to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile  Experiment. Carefully, carefully, like an obstetrician supervising  surgical robots at an unusually difficult birth, he watched the  register until it rolled to rest against the notch that indicated the  exactly crucial moment. Then he pushed a button and froze the machine  where it was.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  push the red switch from him. Then his exciting adventure would be over.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He paused and tapped at his sleek chin. He was supposed to do something  a second before materialization. Yes, that nervous theoretician, Bob  Skeat, had given him a last suggestion.\n\n\n He picked up the small metal box, twisted around to face the opening  of the time machine and dropped it into the gray murk. A solid object  floating near the opening attracted his attention. He shot his arm  out\u2014it was cold , as cold as they had figured\u2014and pulled the object  inside.\n\n\n A sealed metal cylinder. Strange. What was it doing out there?  Anxiously, he opened it, not daring to believe he'd find a document  inside. Yes, that was exactly what it was, he saw excitedly. He began  to read it rapidly, very rapidly, as if it were a newly published paper  on neutrinos. Besides, the manuscript was written with almost painful  simplicity, like a textbook composed by a stuffy pedagogue for the use  of morons.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976, he  read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was the one  of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been warning  about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the Brazilian  jungle through some absolutely unforgivable error in the remote-control  station, the officer in charge of the station was reprimanded and the  men under him court-martialed, and the Brazilian government was paid a  handsome compensation for the damage. But there had been more damage than anyone knew at the time. A plant  virus, similar to the tobacco mosaic, had mutated under the impact  of radioactivity. Five years later, it burst out of the jungle and  completely wiped out every last rice plant on Earth. Japan and a large  part of Asia became semi-deserts inhabited by a few struggling nomads.\n\n\n Then the virus adjusted to wheat and corn\u2014and famine howled in every  street of the planet. All attempts by botanists to control the Blight  failed because of the swiftness of its onslaught. And after it had fed,  it hit again at a new plant and another and another.\n\n\n Most of the world's non-human mammals had been slaughtered for food  long before they could starve to death. Many insects, too, before they  became extinct at the loss of their edible plants, served to assuage  hunger to some small extent.\n\n\n But the nutritive potential of Earth was steadily diminishing in a  horrifying geometric progression. Recently, it had been observed,  plankton\u2014the tiny organism on which most of the sea's ecology was  based\u2014had started to disappear, and with its diminution, dead fish had  begun to pile up on the beaches.\n\n\n Mankind had lunged out desperately in all directions in an effort to  survive, but nothing had worked for any length of time. Even the other  planets of the Solar System, which had been reached and explored  at a tremendous cost in remaining resources, had yielded no edible  vegetation. Synthetics had failed to fill the prodigious gap.\n\n\n In the midst of the sharply increasing hunger, social controls had  pretty much dissolved. Pathetic attempts at rationing still continued,  but black markets became the only markets, and black marketeers the  barons of life. Starvation took the hindmost, and only the most agile  economically lived in comparative comfort. Law and order were had only  by those who could afford to pay for them and children of impoverished  families were sold on the open market for a bit of food.\n\n\n But the Blight was still adjusting to new plants and the food supply  kept shrinking. In another century....\n\n\n That was why the planet's powerful individuals had been persuaded to  pool their wealth in a desperate attempt to alter the past. This kind  of world was manifestly impossible.\n\n\n Mac Albin finished the document and sighed. What a magnificent world!  What an exciting place to live!\n\n\n He dropped his hand on the side levers and began the process of  materializing at the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to take on a  blurred reality all around him, Max Alben felt a bit of fear at what  he was doing. The technicians, he remembered, the Secretary-General,  even the black market kings, had all warned him not to go ahead with  his instructions if anything unusual turned up. That was an awful lot  of power to disobey: he knew he should return with this new information  and let better minds work on it.\n\n\n They with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been  like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility, and  more hunger. Every time things got really tight, you and your wife  looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring  the best price. Buying security for them, as he was now, at the risk of  his life.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, there was a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. A man like himself, with five children\u2014why, he'd be a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! And he'd have robots to work for him and lots of food. Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n\n\n He'd even be a scientist\u2014 everyone was a scientist there, weren't  they?\u2014and he'd have a big laboratory all to himself. This other world  had its troubles, but it was a lot nicer place than where he'd come  from. He wouldn't return. He'd go through with it.\n\n\n The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt  the sensation of power.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  sweating a bit at the sight of the roomful of military figures, despite  the technicians' reassurances that all this would be happening too fast  to be visible. He saw the single red switch pointing upward on the  instrument panel. The switch that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to oscillate into  reality all around him, Mac Albin felt a bit of shame at what he was  doing. He'd promised Bob and Hugo to drop the experiment at any stage  if a new factor showed up. He knew he should go back with this new  information and have all three of them kick it around.\n\n\n But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful  adjustment to their thoroughly blueprinted lives? They, at least, had  been ordered to marry women they could live with; he'd drawn a female  with whom he was completely incompatible in any but a genetic sense.  Genetics! He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. He was tired of having to undertake a simple  adventure like a thief in the night.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, someone like himself would  be a monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own  rules, taking his own women. So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n\n\n He'd formed a pretty good idea of the kind of men who ruled that other  world, from the document in the sealed metal cylinder. The black  marketeers had not even read it. Why, the fools had obviously been  duped by the technicians into permitting the experiment; they had not  grasped the idea that an alternate time track would mean their own  non-existence.\n\n\n This other world had its troubles, but it was certainly a livelier  place than where he'd come from. It deserved a chance. Yes, that was  how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n\n\n Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could  not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument  panel. That was the gimmick that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! ... pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... toward him. flick! ... from him. flick! \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat was Albin\u2019s motivation to not turn back on his journey?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He thought his life would improve\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He thought his life would improve\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He thought his life would improve\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered as he hurried into the  laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,  despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads  deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men  lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.\n\n\n He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the  anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.  This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught  how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great  transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.\n\n\n This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost  outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,  and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also  that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,  being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered again affectionately.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Blight, it would never have been discovered that he and his  seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the ruling powers of Earth, more  than a century later, would never have plucked Max Alben out of an  obscure civil-service job as a relief guard at the North American  Chicken Reservation to his present heroic and remunerative eminence.  He would still be patrolling the barbed wire that surrounded the three  white leghorn hens and two roosters\u2014about one-sixth of the known  livestock wealth of the Western Hemisphere\u2014thoroughly content with  the half-pail of dried apricots he received each and every payday.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Max Alben would  not now be shifting from foot to foot in a physics laboratory,  facing the black market kings of the world and awaiting their final  instructions with an uncertain and submissive grin. Men like O'Hara, who controlled mushrooms, Levney, the blackberry  tycoon, Sorgasso, the packaged-worm monopolist\u2014would black marketeers  of their tremendous stature so much as waste a glance on someone like  Alben ordinarily, let alone confer a lifetime pension on his wife and  five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day?\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family on Earth. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n Alben noticed that Abd Sadha had risen from the straight chair at  the far side of the room and was approaching him with a sealed metal  cylinder in one hand.\n\n\n \"We've decided to add a further precaution at the last moment,\" the old  man said. \"That is, the scientists have suggested it and I have\u2014er\u2014I  have given my approval.\"\n\n\n The last remark was added with a slight questioning note as the  Secretary-General of the United Nations looked back rapidly at the  black market princes on the couches behind him. Since they stared back  stonily, but offered no objection, he coughed in relief and returned to  Alben.\n\n\n \"I am sure, young man, that I don't have to go into the details of your  instructions once more. You enter the time machine and go back the  duration for which it has been preset, a hundred and thirteen years, to  the moment after the Guided Missile of 1976 was launched. It is 1976,  isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said  respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile  that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18,  1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very  much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting  dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\n\n \"Just so.\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You  see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the  very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile  was\u2014er\u2014handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a  superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and  alter human history for the better. Very much for the better. Yes.\"\n\n\n He paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\n\n \"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root  magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\n\n \"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him.  Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little  red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing  the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle  and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as  originally planned.\"\n\n\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations beamed. \"Thus preventing  the Blight, making it nonexistent, as it were, producing a present-day  world in which the Blight never occurred. That is correct, is it not,  gentlemen?\" he asked, turning anxiously again. None of the half-dozen men on couches deigned to answer him. And  Alben kept his eyes deferentially in their direction, too, as he had  throughout this period of last-minute instruction.\n\n\n He knew who ruled his world\u2014these stolid, well-fed men in clean  garments with a minimum of patches, and where patches occurred, at  least they were the color of the surrounding cloth.\n\n\n Sadha might be Secretary-General of the United Nations, but that  was still a civil-service job, only a few social notches higher  than a chicken guard. His clothes were fully as ragged, fully as  multi-colored, as those that Alben had stepped out of. And the gnawing  in his stomach was no doubt almost as great.\n\n\n \"You understand, do you not, young man, that if anything goes wrong,\"  Abd Sadha asked, his head nodding tremulously and anticipating the  answer, \"if anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to  continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"\n\n\n \"He understands everything he has to understand,\" Gomez told him.  \"Let's get this thing moving.\"\n\n\n The old man smiled again. \"Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.\" He came up to  where Alben stood in the entrance of the time machine and handed the  sealed metal cylinder to him. \"This is the precaution the scientists  have just added. When you arrive at your destination, just before  materializing, you will release it into the surrounding temporal  medium. Our purpose here, as you no doubt\u2014\"\n\n\n Levney sat up on his couch and snapped his fingers peremptorily. \"I  just heard Gomez tell you to get this thing moving, Sadha. And it isn't  moving. We're busy men. We've wasted enough time.\"\n\n\n \"I was just trying to explain a crucial final fact,\" the  Secretary-General apologized. \"A fact which may be highly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've explained enough facts.\" Levney turned to the man inside the  time machine. \"Hey, fella. You. Move! \"\n\n\n Max Alben gulped and nodded violently. He darted to the rear of the  machine and turned the dial which activated it. flick! It was a good job and Mac Albin knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed as he looked at the morose faces  of his two colleagues. Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had done as much as he  to build the tiny time machine in the secret lab under the helicopter  garage, and they were fully as eager to go, but\u2014unfortunately for  them\u2014they were not descended from the right ancestor.\n\n\n Leisurely, he unzipped the richly embroidered garment that, as the  father of two children, he was privileged to wear, and wriggled into  the housing of the complex little mechanism. This was hardly the  first time he had seen it, since he'd been helping to build the device  from the moment Honek had nodded and risen from the drafting board,  and now he barely wasted a glance on the thumb-size translucent coils  growing out of the almost microscopic energy bubbles which powered them.\n\n\n This machine was the last hope, of 2089, even if the world of 2089, as  a whole, did not know of its existence and would try to prevent its  being put into operation. But it meant a lot more to Mac Albin than  merely saving a world. It meant an adventurous mission with the risk of  death.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed again happily.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Epidemic, it would never have been discovered that he and  his seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the Albins would not have become  physicists upon the passage of the United Nations law that everyone  on Earth\u2014absolutely without exception\u2014had to choose a branch of  research science in which to specialize. In the flabby, careful,  life-guarding world the Earth had become, Mac Albin would never have  been reluctantly selected by his two co-workers as the one to carry the  forbidden banner of dangerous experiment.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Mac Albin would  probably be a biologist today like almost everyone else on Earth,  laboriously working out dreary gene problems instead of embarking on  the greatest adventure Man had known to date.\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, he had at last found a socially useful  escape from genetic responsibility to humanity in general and his own  family in particular. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Mac,\" Skeat said and crossed to the other side of the  narrow laboratory. Albin and Honek watched him stuff several sheets of paper into a small  metal box which he closed without locking.\n\n\n \"You will take care of yourself, won't you, Mac?\" Hugo Honek pleaded.  \"Any time you feel like taking an unnecessary risk, remember that Bob  and I will have to stand trial if you don't come back. We might be  sentenced to complete loss of professional status and spend the rest of  our lives supervising robot factories.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it won't be that bad,\" Albin reassured him absent-mindedly from  where he lay contorted inside the time machine. He watched Skeat coming  toward him with the box.\n\n\n Honek shrugged his shoulders. \"It might be a lot worse than even that  and you know it. The disappearance of a two-time father is going to  leave an awful big vacancy in the world. One-timers, like Bob and  me, are all over the place; if either of us dropped out of sight, it  wouldn't cause nearly as much uproar.\"\n\n\n \"But Bob and you both tried to operate the machine,\" Albin reminded  him. \"And you blacked out after a fifteen-second temporal displacement.  So I'm the only chance, the only way to stop the human race from  dwindling and dwindling till it hits absolute zero, like that fat old  Security Council seems willing for it to do.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Mac,\" Bob Skeat said as he handed the metal box to  Albin. \"The Security Council is just trying to solve the problem in  their way, the conservative way: a worldwide concentration on genetics  research coupled with the maximum preservation of existing human lives,  especially those that have a high reproductive potential. We three  disagree with them; we've been skulking down here nights to solve it our way, and ours is a radical approach and plenty risky. That's  the reason for the metal box\u2014trying to cover one more explosive  possibility.\"\n\n\n Albin turned it around curiously. \"How?\"\n\n\n \"I sat up all last night writing the manuscript that's inside it. Look,  Mac, when you go back to the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976 and  push that red switch away from you, a lot of other things are going to  happen than just deflecting the missile so that it will explode in the  Brazilian jungle instead of the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. I know. If it explodes in the jungle, the Epidemic doesn't  occur. No Shapiro's Mumps.\"\n\n\n Skeat jiggled his pudgy little face impatiently. \"That's not what I  mean. The Epidemic doesn't occur, but something else does. A new world,  a different 2089, an alternate time sequence. It'll be a world in which  humanity has a better chance to survive, but it'll be one with problems  of its own. Maybe tough problems. Maybe the problems will be tough  enough so that they'll get the same idea we did and try to go back to  the same point in time to change them.\" Albin laughed. \"That's just looking for trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it is, but that's my job. Hugo's the designer of the time  machine and you're the operator, but I'm the theoretical man in this  research team. It's my job to look for trouble. So, just in case, I  wrote a brief history of the world from the time the missile exploded  in the Pacific. It tells why ours is the worst possible of futures.  It's in that box.\"\n\n\n \"What do I do with it\u2014hand it to the guy from the alternate 2089?\"\n\n\n The small fat man exasperatedly hit the side of the time machine with  a well-cushioned palm. \"You know better. There won't be any alternate  2089 until you push that red switch on the green instrument panel. The  moment you do, our world, with all its slow slide to extinction, goes  out and its alternate goes on\u2014just like two electric light bulbs on a  push-pull circuit. We and every single one of our artifacts, including  the time machine, disappear. The problem is how to keep that manuscript  from disappearing.\n\n\n \"Well, all you do, if I have this figured right, is shove the metal  box containing the manuscript out into the surrounding temporal medium  a moment before you materialize to do your job. That temporal medium  in which you'll be traveling is something that exists independent of  and autonomous to all possible futures. It's my hunch that something  that's immersed in it will not be altered by a new time sequence.\" \"Remind him to be careful, Bob,\" Honek rumbled. \"He thinks he's Captain  Blood and this is his big chance to run away to sea and become a  swashbuckling pirate.\"\n\n\n Albin grimaced in annoyance. \"I am excited by doing something  besides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions for the first time in my life. But I know that this is a  first experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I really have enough intelligence to  recognize that simple fact. I know that if anything unexpected pops up,  anything we didn't foresee, I'm supposed to come scuttling back and ask  for advice.\"\n\n\n \"I hope you do,\" Bob Skeat sighed. \"I hope you do know that. A  twentieth century poet once wrote something to the effect that the  world will end not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, our world is  ending with a whimper. Try to see that it doesn't end with a bang,  either.\"\n\n\n \"That I'll promise you,\" Albin said a trifle disgustedly. \"It'll end  with neither a bang nor a whimper. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.\"\n\n\n He twisted around, reaching overhead for the lever which activated the  forces that drove the time machine. flick! It was strange, Max Alben reflected, that this time travel business,  which knocked unconscious everyone who tried it, only made him feel  slightly dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni,  he had been told. There must be some complicated scientific explanation  for it, he decided\u2014and that would make it none of his business. Better  forget about it.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a heavy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of patrolling his beat at the North American Chicken Reservation in a  thick fog.\n\n\n According to his gauges, he was now in 1976. He cut speed until he hit  the last day of April, then cut speed again, drifting slowly backward  to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile Experiment.  Carefully, carefully, like a man handling a strange bomb made on a  strange planet, he watched the center gauge until the needle came to  rest against the thin etched line that indicated the exactly crucial  moment. Then he pulled the brake and stopped the machine dead.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  pull the red switch toward him. Then his well-paid assignment would be  done.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He stopped and scratched his dirt-matted hair. Wasn't there something  he was supposed to do a second before materialization? Yes, that  useless old windbag, Sadha, had given him a last instruction.\n\n\n He picked up the sealed metal cylinder, walked to the entrance of the  time machine and tossed it into the gray murk. A solid object floating  near the entrance caught his eye. He put his arm out\u2014whew, it was  cold!\u2014and pulled it inside.\n\n\n A small metal box. Funny. What was it doing out there? Curiously,  he opened it, hoping to find something valuable. Nothing but a few  sheets of paper, Alben noted disappointedly. He began to read them  slowly, very slowly, for the manuscript was full of a lot of long and  complicated words, like a letter from one bookworm scientist to another.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976,  he read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was  the one of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been  warning about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the  Pacific Ocean as planned, the physicists and the military men went  home to study their notes, and the world shivered once more over the  approaching war and tried to forget about it.\n\n\n But there was fallout, a radioactive rain several hundred miles to  the north, and a small fishing fleet got thoroughly soaked by it.  Fortunately, the radioactivity in the rain was sufficiently low to do  little obvious physical damage: All it did was cause a mutation in the  mumps virus that several of the men in the fleet were incubating at the  time, having caught it from the children of the fishing town, among  whom a minor epidemic was raging. The fleet returned to its home town, which promptly came down with the  new kind of mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, the only physician in town,  was the first man to note that, while the symptoms of this disease were  substantially milder than those of its unmutated parent, practically no  one was immune to it and its effects on human reproductivity were truly  terrible. Most people were completely sterilized by it. The rest were  rendered much less capable of fathering or bearing offspring.\n\n\n Shapiro's Mumps spread over the entire planet in the next few decades.  It leaped across every quarantine erected; for a long time, it  successfully defied all the vaccines and serums attempted against  it. Then, when a vaccine was finally perfected, humanity discovered  to its dismay that its generative powers had been permanently and  fundamentally impaired.\n\n\n Something had happened to the germ plasm. A large percentage of  individuals were born sterile, and, of those who were not, one child  was usually the most that could be expected, a two-child parent being  quite rare and a three-child parent almost unknown.\n\n\n Strict eugenic control was instituted by the Security Council of the  United Nations so that fertile men and women would not be wasted upon  non-fertile mates. Fertility was the most important avenue to social  status, and right after it came successful genetic research.\n\n\n Genetic research had the very best minds prodded into it; the lesser  ones went into the other sciences. Everyone on Earth was engaged in  some form of scientific research to some extent. Since the population  was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all  physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it  that everybody had an ample supply of goods and, in return, asked only  that they experiment without any risk to their own lives\u2014every human  being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\n\n\n There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point, it had been estimated, where a species might be wiped out by a  new calamity. Not that another calamity would be needed. Since the end  of the Epidemic, the birth rate had been moving further and further  behind the death rate. In another century....\n\n\n That was why a desperate and secret attempt to alter the past was being  made. This kind of world was evidently impossible.\n\n\n Max Alben finished the manuscript and sighed. What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n\n\n He walked to the rear dials and began the process of materializing at  the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! It was odd, Mac Albin reflected, that these temporal journeys, which  induced coma in everyone who tried it, only made him feel slightly  dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni, he  knew. Maybe there was some genetic relationship with his above-average  fertility\u2014might be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or  two when he returned. If he returned.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a soupy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of the problems of landing a helicopter in a thick fog when the robot  butler had not been told to turn on the ground lights.\n\n\n According to the insulated register, he was now in 1976. He lowered  speed until he registered April, then maneuvered slowly backward  through time to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile  Experiment. Carefully, carefully, like an obstetrician supervising  surgical robots at an unusually difficult birth, he watched the  register until it rolled to rest against the notch that indicated the  exactly crucial moment. Then he pushed a button and froze the machine  where it was.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  push the red switch from him. Then his exciting adventure would be over.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He paused and tapped at his sleek chin. He was supposed to do something  a second before materialization. Yes, that nervous theoretician, Bob  Skeat, had given him a last suggestion.\n\n\n He picked up the small metal box, twisted around to face the opening  of the time machine and dropped it into the gray murk. A solid object  floating near the opening attracted his attention. He shot his arm  out\u2014it was cold , as cold as they had figured\u2014and pulled the object  inside.\n\n\n A sealed metal cylinder. Strange. What was it doing out there?  Anxiously, he opened it, not daring to believe he'd find a document  inside. Yes, that was exactly what it was, he saw excitedly. He began  to read it rapidly, very rapidly, as if it were a newly published paper  on neutrinos. Besides, the manuscript was written with almost painful  simplicity, like a textbook composed by a stuffy pedagogue for the use  of morons.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976, he  read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was the one  of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been warning  about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the Brazilian  jungle through some absolutely unforgivable error in the remote-control  station, the officer in charge of the station was reprimanded and the  men under him court-martialed, and the Brazilian government was paid a  handsome compensation for the damage. But there had been more damage than anyone knew at the time. A plant  virus, similar to the tobacco mosaic, had mutated under the impact  of radioactivity. Five years later, it burst out of the jungle and  completely wiped out every last rice plant on Earth. Japan and a large  part of Asia became semi-deserts inhabited by a few struggling nomads.\n\n\n Then the virus adjusted to wheat and corn\u2014and famine howled in every  street of the planet. All attempts by botanists to control the Blight  failed because of the swiftness of its onslaught. And after it had fed,  it hit again at a new plant and another and another.\n\n\n Most of the world's non-human mammals had been slaughtered for food  long before they could starve to death. Many insects, too, before they  became extinct at the loss of their edible plants, served to assuage  hunger to some small extent.\n\n\n But the nutritive potential of Earth was steadily diminishing in a  horrifying geometric progression. Recently, it had been observed,  plankton\u2014the tiny organism on which most of the sea's ecology was  based\u2014had started to disappear, and with its diminution, dead fish had  begun to pile up on the beaches.\n\n\n Mankind had lunged out desperately in all directions in an effort to  survive, but nothing had worked for any length of time. Even the other  planets of the Solar System, which had been reached and explored  at a tremendous cost in remaining resources, had yielded no edible  vegetation. Synthetics had failed to fill the prodigious gap.\n\n\n In the midst of the sharply increasing hunger, social controls had  pretty much dissolved. Pathetic attempts at rationing still continued,  but black markets became the only markets, and black marketeers the  barons of life. Starvation took the hindmost, and only the most agile  economically lived in comparative comfort. Law and order were had only  by those who could afford to pay for them and children of impoverished  families were sold on the open market for a bit of food.\n\n\n But the Blight was still adjusting to new plants and the food supply  kept shrinking. In another century....\n\n\n That was why the planet's powerful individuals had been persuaded to  pool their wealth in a desperate attempt to alter the past. This kind  of world was manifestly impossible.\n\n\n Mac Albin finished the document and sighed. What a magnificent world!  What an exciting place to live!\n\n\n He dropped his hand on the side levers and began the process of  materializing at the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to take on a  blurred reality all around him, Max Alben felt a bit of fear at what  he was doing. The technicians, he remembered, the Secretary-General,  even the black market kings, had all warned him not to go ahead with  his instructions if anything unusual turned up. That was an awful lot  of power to disobey: he knew he should return with this new information  and let better minds work on it.\n\n\n They with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been  like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility, and  more hunger. Every time things got really tight, you and your wife  looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring  the best price. Buying security for them, as he was now, at the risk of  his life.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, there was a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. A man like himself, with five children\u2014why, he'd be a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! And he'd have robots to work for him and lots of food. Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n\n\n He'd even be a scientist\u2014 everyone was a scientist there, weren't  they?\u2014and he'd have a big laboratory all to himself. This other world  had its troubles, but it was a lot nicer place than where he'd come  from. He wouldn't return. He'd go through with it.\n\n\n The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt  the sensation of power.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  sweating a bit at the sight of the roomful of military figures, despite  the technicians' reassurances that all this would be happening too fast  to be visible. He saw the single red switch pointing upward on the  instrument panel. The switch that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to oscillate into  reality all around him, Mac Albin felt a bit of shame at what he was  doing. He'd promised Bob and Hugo to drop the experiment at any stage  if a new factor showed up. He knew he should go back with this new  information and have all three of them kick it around.\n\n\n But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful  adjustment to their thoroughly blueprinted lives? They, at least, had  been ordered to marry women they could live with; he'd drawn a female  with whom he was completely incompatible in any but a genetic sense.  Genetics! He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. He was tired of having to undertake a simple  adventure like a thief in the night.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, someone like himself would  be a monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own  rules, taking his own women. So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n\n\n He'd formed a pretty good idea of the kind of men who ruled that other  world, from the document in the sealed metal cylinder. The black  marketeers had not even read it. Why, the fools had obviously been  duped by the technicians into permitting the experiment; they had not  grasped the idea that an alternate time track would mean their own  non-existence.\n\n\n This other world had its troubles, but it was certainly a livelier  place than where he'd come from. It deserved a chance. Yes, that was  how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n\n\n Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could  not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument  panel. That was the gimmick that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! ... pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... toward him. flick! ... from him. flick! \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat was Albin\u2019s motivation to not turn back on his journey?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He thought his life would improve\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds.

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered as he hurried into the  laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,  despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads  deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men  lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.\n\n\n He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the  anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.  This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught  how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great  transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.\n\n\n This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost  outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,  and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also  that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,  being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered again affectionately.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Blight, it would never have been discovered that he and his  seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the ruling powers of Earth, more  than a century later, would never have plucked Max Alben out of an  obscure civil-service job as a relief guard at the North American  Chicken Reservation to his present heroic and remunerative eminence.  He would still be patrolling the barbed wire that surrounded the three  white leghorn hens and two roosters\u2014about one-sixth of the known  livestock wealth of the Western Hemisphere\u2014thoroughly content with  the half-pail of dried apricots he received each and every payday.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Max Alben would  not now be shifting from foot to foot in a physics laboratory,  facing the black market kings of the world and awaiting their final  instructions with an uncertain and submissive grin. Men like O'Hara, who controlled mushrooms, Levney, the blackberry  tycoon, Sorgasso, the packaged-worm monopolist\u2014would black marketeers  of their tremendous stature so much as waste a glance on someone like  Alben ordinarily, let alone confer a lifetime pension on his wife and  five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day?\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family on Earth. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n Alben noticed that Abd Sadha had risen from the straight chair at  the far side of the room and was approaching him with a sealed metal  cylinder in one hand.\n\n\n \"We've decided to add a further precaution at the last moment,\" the old  man said. \"That is, the scientists have suggested it and I have\u2014er\u2014I  have given my approval.\"\n\n\n The last remark was added with a slight questioning note as the  Secretary-General of the United Nations looked back rapidly at the  black market princes on the couches behind him. Since they stared back  stonily, but offered no objection, he coughed in relief and returned to  Alben.\n\n\n \"I am sure, young man, that I don't have to go into the details of your  instructions once more. You enter the time machine and go back the  duration for which it has been preset, a hundred and thirteen years, to  the moment after the Guided Missile of 1976 was launched. It is 1976,  isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said  respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile  that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18,  1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very  much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting  dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\n\n \"Just so.\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You  see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the  very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile  was\u2014er\u2014handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a  superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and  alter human history for the better. Very much for the better. Yes.\"\n\n\n He paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\n\n \"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root  magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\n\n \"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him.  Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little  red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing  the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle  and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as  originally planned.\"\n\n\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations beamed. \"Thus preventing  the Blight, making it nonexistent, as it were, producing a present-day  world in which the Blight never occurred. That is correct, is it not,  gentlemen?\" he asked, turning anxiously again. None of the half-dozen men on couches deigned to answer him. And  Alben kept his eyes deferentially in their direction, too, as he had  throughout this period of last-minute instruction.\n\n\n He knew who ruled his world\u2014these stolid, well-fed men in clean  garments with a minimum of patches, and where patches occurred, at  least they were the color of the surrounding cloth.\n\n\n Sadha might be Secretary-General of the United Nations, but that  was still a civil-service job, only a few social notches higher  than a chicken guard. His clothes were fully as ragged, fully as  multi-colored, as those that Alben had stepped out of. And the gnawing  in his stomach was no doubt almost as great.\n\n\n \"You understand, do you not, young man, that if anything goes wrong,\"  Abd Sadha asked, his head nodding tremulously and anticipating the  answer, \"if anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to  continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"\n\n\n \"He understands everything he has to understand,\" Gomez told him.  \"Let's get this thing moving.\"\n\n\n The old man smiled again. \"Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.\" He came up to  where Alben stood in the entrance of the time machine and handed the  sealed metal cylinder to him. \"This is the precaution the scientists  have just added. When you arrive at your destination, just before  materializing, you will release it into the surrounding temporal  medium. Our purpose here, as you no doubt\u2014\"\n\n\n Levney sat up on his couch and snapped his fingers peremptorily. \"I  just heard Gomez tell you to get this thing moving, Sadha. And it isn't  moving. We're busy men. We've wasted enough time.\"\n\n\n \"I was just trying to explain a crucial final fact,\" the  Secretary-General apologized. \"A fact which may be highly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've explained enough facts.\" Levney turned to the man inside the  time machine. \"Hey, fella. You. Move! \"\n\n\n Max Alben gulped and nodded violently. He darted to the rear of the  machine and turned the dial which activated it. flick! It was a good job and Mac Albin knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed as he looked at the morose faces  of his two colleagues. Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had done as much as he  to build the tiny time machine in the secret lab under the helicopter  garage, and they were fully as eager to go, but\u2014unfortunately for  them\u2014they were not descended from the right ancestor.\n\n\n Leisurely, he unzipped the richly embroidered garment that, as the  father of two children, he was privileged to wear, and wriggled into  the housing of the complex little mechanism. This was hardly the  first time he had seen it, since he'd been helping to build the device  from the moment Honek had nodded and risen from the drafting board,  and now he barely wasted a glance on the thumb-size translucent coils  growing out of the almost microscopic energy bubbles which powered them.\n\n\n This machine was the last hope, of 2089, even if the world of 2089, as  a whole, did not know of its existence and would try to prevent its  being put into operation. But it meant a lot more to Mac Albin than  merely saving a world. It meant an adventurous mission with the risk of  death.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed again happily.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Epidemic, it would never have been discovered that he and  his seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the Albins would not have become  physicists upon the passage of the United Nations law that everyone  on Earth\u2014absolutely without exception\u2014had to choose a branch of  research science in which to specialize. In the flabby, careful,  life-guarding world the Earth had become, Mac Albin would never have  been reluctantly selected by his two co-workers as the one to carry the  forbidden banner of dangerous experiment.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Mac Albin would  probably be a biologist today like almost everyone else on Earth,  laboriously working out dreary gene problems instead of embarking on  the greatest adventure Man had known to date.\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, he had at last found a socially useful  escape from genetic responsibility to humanity in general and his own  family in particular. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Mac,\" Skeat said and crossed to the other side of the  narrow laboratory. Albin and Honek watched him stuff several sheets of paper into a small  metal box which he closed without locking.\n\n\n \"You will take care of yourself, won't you, Mac?\" Hugo Honek pleaded.  \"Any time you feel like taking an unnecessary risk, remember that Bob  and I will have to stand trial if you don't come back. We might be  sentenced to complete loss of professional status and spend the rest of  our lives supervising robot factories.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it won't be that bad,\" Albin reassured him absent-mindedly from  where he lay contorted inside the time machine. He watched Skeat coming  toward him with the box.\n\n\n Honek shrugged his shoulders. \"It might be a lot worse than even that  and you know it. The disappearance of a two-time father is going to  leave an awful big vacancy in the world. One-timers, like Bob and  me, are all over the place; if either of us dropped out of sight, it  wouldn't cause nearly as much uproar.\"\n\n\n \"But Bob and you both tried to operate the machine,\" Albin reminded  him. \"And you blacked out after a fifteen-second temporal displacement.  So I'm the only chance, the only way to stop the human race from  dwindling and dwindling till it hits absolute zero, like that fat old  Security Council seems willing for it to do.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Mac,\" Bob Skeat said as he handed the metal box to  Albin. \"The Security Council is just trying to solve the problem in  their way, the conservative way: a worldwide concentration on genetics  research coupled with the maximum preservation of existing human lives,  especially those that have a high reproductive potential. We three  disagree with them; we've been skulking down here nights to solve it our way, and ours is a radical approach and plenty risky. That's  the reason for the metal box\u2014trying to cover one more explosive  possibility.\"\n\n\n Albin turned it around curiously. \"How?\"\n\n\n \"I sat up all last night writing the manuscript that's inside it. Look,  Mac, when you go back to the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976 and  push that red switch away from you, a lot of other things are going to  happen than just deflecting the missile so that it will explode in the  Brazilian jungle instead of the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. I know. If it explodes in the jungle, the Epidemic doesn't  occur. No Shapiro's Mumps.\"\n\n\n Skeat jiggled his pudgy little face impatiently. \"That's not what I  mean. The Epidemic doesn't occur, but something else does. A new world,  a different 2089, an alternate time sequence. It'll be a world in which  humanity has a better chance to survive, but it'll be one with problems  of its own. Maybe tough problems. Maybe the problems will be tough  enough so that they'll get the same idea we did and try to go back to  the same point in time to change them.\" Albin laughed. \"That's just looking for trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it is, but that's my job. Hugo's the designer of the time  machine and you're the operator, but I'm the theoretical man in this  research team. It's my job to look for trouble. So, just in case, I  wrote a brief history of the world from the time the missile exploded  in the Pacific. It tells why ours is the worst possible of futures.  It's in that box.\"\n\n\n \"What do I do with it\u2014hand it to the guy from the alternate 2089?\"\n\n\n The small fat man exasperatedly hit the side of the time machine with  a well-cushioned palm. \"You know better. There won't be any alternate  2089 until you push that red switch on the green instrument panel. The  moment you do, our world, with all its slow slide to extinction, goes  out and its alternate goes on\u2014just like two electric light bulbs on a  push-pull circuit. We and every single one of our artifacts, including  the time machine, disappear. The problem is how to keep that manuscript  from disappearing.\n\n\n \"Well, all you do, if I have this figured right, is shove the metal  box containing the manuscript out into the surrounding temporal medium  a moment before you materialize to do your job. That temporal medium  in which you'll be traveling is something that exists independent of  and autonomous to all possible futures. It's my hunch that something  that's immersed in it will not be altered by a new time sequence.\" \"Remind him to be careful, Bob,\" Honek rumbled. \"He thinks he's Captain  Blood and this is his big chance to run away to sea and become a  swashbuckling pirate.\"\n\n\n Albin grimaced in annoyance. \"I am excited by doing something  besides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions for the first time in my life. But I know that this is a  first experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I really have enough intelligence to  recognize that simple fact. I know that if anything unexpected pops up,  anything we didn't foresee, I'm supposed to come scuttling back and ask  for advice.\"\n\n\n \"I hope you do,\" Bob Skeat sighed. \"I hope you do know that. A  twentieth century poet once wrote something to the effect that the  world will end not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, our world is  ending with a whimper. Try to see that it doesn't end with a bang,  either.\"\n\n\n \"That I'll promise you,\" Albin said a trifle disgustedly. \"It'll end  with neither a bang nor a whimper. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.\"\n\n\n He twisted around, reaching overhead for the lever which activated the  forces that drove the time machine. flick! It was strange, Max Alben reflected, that this time travel business,  which knocked unconscious everyone who tried it, only made him feel  slightly dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni,  he had been told. There must be some complicated scientific explanation  for it, he decided\u2014and that would make it none of his business. Better  forget about it.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a heavy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of patrolling his beat at the North American Chicken Reservation in a  thick fog.\n\n\n According to his gauges, he was now in 1976. He cut speed until he hit  the last day of April, then cut speed again, drifting slowly backward  to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile Experiment.  Carefully, carefully, like a man handling a strange bomb made on a  strange planet, he watched the center gauge until the needle came to  rest against the thin etched line that indicated the exactly crucial  moment. Then he pulled the brake and stopped the machine dead.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  pull the red switch toward him. Then his well-paid assignment would be  done.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He stopped and scratched his dirt-matted hair. Wasn't there something  he was supposed to do a second before materialization? Yes, that  useless old windbag, Sadha, had given him a last instruction.\n\n\n He picked up the sealed metal cylinder, walked to the entrance of the  time machine and tossed it into the gray murk. A solid object floating  near the entrance caught his eye. He put his arm out\u2014whew, it was  cold!\u2014and pulled it inside.\n\n\n A small metal box. Funny. What was it doing out there? Curiously,  he opened it, hoping to find something valuable. Nothing but a few  sheets of paper, Alben noted disappointedly. He began to read them  slowly, very slowly, for the manuscript was full of a lot of long and  complicated words, like a letter from one bookworm scientist to another.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976,  he read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was  the one of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been  warning about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the  Pacific Ocean as planned, the physicists and the military men went  home to study their notes, and the world shivered once more over the  approaching war and tried to forget about it.\n\n\n But there was fallout, a radioactive rain several hundred miles to  the north, and a small fishing fleet got thoroughly soaked by it.  Fortunately, the radioactivity in the rain was sufficiently low to do  little obvious physical damage: All it did was cause a mutation in the  mumps virus that several of the men in the fleet were incubating at the  time, having caught it from the children of the fishing town, among  whom a minor epidemic was raging. The fleet returned to its home town, which promptly came down with the  new kind of mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, the only physician in town,  was the first man to note that, while the symptoms of this disease were  substantially milder than those of its unmutated parent, practically no  one was immune to it and its effects on human reproductivity were truly  terrible. Most people were completely sterilized by it. The rest were  rendered much less capable of fathering or bearing offspring.\n\n\n Shapiro's Mumps spread over the entire planet in the next few decades.  It leaped across every quarantine erected; for a long time, it  successfully defied all the vaccines and serums attempted against  it. Then, when a vaccine was finally perfected, humanity discovered  to its dismay that its generative powers had been permanently and  fundamentally impaired.\n\n\n Something had happened to the germ plasm. A large percentage of  individuals were born sterile, and, of those who were not, one child  was usually the most that could be expected, a two-child parent being  quite rare and a three-child parent almost unknown.\n\n\n Strict eugenic control was instituted by the Security Council of the  United Nations so that fertile men and women would not be wasted upon  non-fertile mates. Fertility was the most important avenue to social  status, and right after it came successful genetic research.\n\n\n Genetic research had the very best minds prodded into it; the lesser  ones went into the other sciences. Everyone on Earth was engaged in  some form of scientific research to some extent. Since the population  was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all  physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it  that everybody had an ample supply of goods and, in return, asked only  that they experiment without any risk to their own lives\u2014every human  being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\n\n\n There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point, it had been estimated, where a species might be wiped out by a  new calamity. Not that another calamity would be needed. Since the end  of the Epidemic, the birth rate had been moving further and further  behind the death rate. In another century....\n\n\n That was why a desperate and secret attempt to alter the past was being  made. This kind of world was evidently impossible.\n\n\n Max Alben finished the manuscript and sighed. What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n\n\n He walked to the rear dials and began the process of materializing at  the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! It was odd, Mac Albin reflected, that these temporal journeys, which  induced coma in everyone who tried it, only made him feel slightly  dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni, he  knew. Maybe there was some genetic relationship with his above-average  fertility\u2014might be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or  two when he returned. If he returned.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a soupy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of the problems of landing a helicopter in a thick fog when the robot  butler had not been told to turn on the ground lights.\n\n\n According to the insulated register, he was now in 1976. He lowered  speed until he registered April, then maneuvered slowly backward  through time to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile  Experiment. Carefully, carefully, like an obstetrician supervising  surgical robots at an unusually difficult birth, he watched the  register until it rolled to rest against the notch that indicated the  exactly crucial moment. Then he pushed a button and froze the machine  where it was.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  push the red switch from him. Then his exciting adventure would be over.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He paused and tapped at his sleek chin. He was supposed to do something  a second before materialization. Yes, that nervous theoretician, Bob  Skeat, had given him a last suggestion.\n\n\n He picked up the small metal box, twisted around to face the opening  of the time machine and dropped it into the gray murk. A solid object  floating near the opening attracted his attention. He shot his arm  out\u2014it was cold , as cold as they had figured\u2014and pulled the object  inside.\n\n\n A sealed metal cylinder. Strange. What was it doing out there?  Anxiously, he opened it, not daring to believe he'd find a document  inside. Yes, that was exactly what it was, he saw excitedly. He began  to read it rapidly, very rapidly, as if it were a newly published paper  on neutrinos. Besides, the manuscript was written with almost painful  simplicity, like a textbook composed by a stuffy pedagogue for the use  of morons.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976, he  read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was the one  of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been warning  about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the Brazilian  jungle through some absolutely unforgivable error in the remote-control  station, the officer in charge of the station was reprimanded and the  men under him court-martialed, and the Brazilian government was paid a  handsome compensation for the damage. But there had been more damage than anyone knew at the time. A plant  virus, similar to the tobacco mosaic, had mutated under the impact  of radioactivity. Five years later, it burst out of the jungle and  completely wiped out every last rice plant on Earth. Japan and a large  part of Asia became semi-deserts inhabited by a few struggling nomads.\n\n\n Then the virus adjusted to wheat and corn\u2014and famine howled in every  street of the planet. All attempts by botanists to control the Blight  failed because of the swiftness of its onslaught. And after it had fed,  it hit again at a new plant and another and another.\n\n\n Most of the world's non-human mammals had been slaughtered for food  long before they could starve to death. Many insects, too, before they  became extinct at the loss of their edible plants, served to assuage  hunger to some small extent.\n\n\n But the nutritive potential of Earth was steadily diminishing in a  horrifying geometric progression. Recently, it had been observed,  plankton\u2014the tiny organism on which most of the sea's ecology was  based\u2014had started to disappear, and with its diminution, dead fish had  begun to pile up on the beaches.\n\n\n Mankind had lunged out desperately in all directions in an effort to  survive, but nothing had worked for any length of time. Even the other  planets of the Solar System, which had been reached and explored  at a tremendous cost in remaining resources, had yielded no edible  vegetation. Synthetics had failed to fill the prodigious gap.\n\n\n In the midst of the sharply increasing hunger, social controls had  pretty much dissolved. Pathetic attempts at rationing still continued,  but black markets became the only markets, and black marketeers the  barons of life. Starvation took the hindmost, and only the most agile  economically lived in comparative comfort. Law and order were had only  by those who could afford to pay for them and children of impoverished  families were sold on the open market for a bit of food.\n\n\n But the Blight was still adjusting to new plants and the food supply  kept shrinking. In another century....\n\n\n That was why the planet's powerful individuals had been persuaded to  pool their wealth in a desperate attempt to alter the past. This kind  of world was manifestly impossible.\n\n\n Mac Albin finished the document and sighed. What a magnificent world!  What an exciting place to live!\n\n\n He dropped his hand on the side levers and began the process of  materializing at the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to take on a  blurred reality all around him, Max Alben felt a bit of fear at what  he was doing. The technicians, he remembered, the Secretary-General,  even the black market kings, had all warned him not to go ahead with  his instructions if anything unusual turned up. That was an awful lot  of power to disobey: he knew he should return with this new information  and let better minds work on it.\n\n\n They with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been  like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility, and  more hunger. Every time things got really tight, you and your wife  looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring  the best price. Buying security for them, as he was now, at the risk of  his life.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, there was a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. A man like himself, with five children\u2014why, he'd be a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! And he'd have robots to work for him and lots of food. Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n\n\n He'd even be a scientist\u2014 everyone was a scientist there, weren't  they?\u2014and he'd have a big laboratory all to himself. This other world  had its troubles, but it was a lot nicer place than where he'd come  from. He wouldn't return. He'd go through with it.\n\n\n The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt  the sensation of power.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  sweating a bit at the sight of the roomful of military figures, despite  the technicians' reassurances that all this would be happening too fast  to be visible. He saw the single red switch pointing upward on the  instrument panel. The switch that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to oscillate into  reality all around him, Mac Albin felt a bit of shame at what he was  doing. He'd promised Bob and Hugo to drop the experiment at any stage  if a new factor showed up. He knew he should go back with this new  information and have all three of them kick it around.\n\n\n But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful  adjustment to their thoroughly blueprinted lives? They, at least, had  been ordered to marry women they could live with; he'd drawn a female  with whom he was completely incompatible in any but a genetic sense.  Genetics! He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. He was tired of having to undertake a simple  adventure like a thief in the night.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, someone like himself would  be a monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own  rules, taking his own women. So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n\n\n He'd formed a pretty good idea of the kind of men who ruled that other  world, from the document in the sealed metal cylinder. The black  marketeers had not even read it. Why, the fools had obviously been  duped by the technicians into permitting the experiment; they had not  grasped the idea that an alternate time track would mean their own  non-existence.\n\n\n This other world had its troubles, but it was certainly a livelier  place than where he'd come from. It deserved a chance. Yes, that was  how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n\n\n Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could  not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument  panel. That was the gimmick that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! ... pushed the little red switch from him. flick! ... toward him. flick! ... from him. flick! \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat was Albin\u2019s motivation to not turn back on his journey?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He thought his life would improve\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He thought his life would improve\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe thought his life would improve\u201d\n\n1. Primary Evidence of Desire for Better Life  \n  a. Direct Admiration of Alternate World  \n     \u2022 \u201cWhat a wonderful world! What a comfortable place to live!\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.75, \u201cWhat a wonderful world!\u201d</invalid_quote>) indicates genuine attraction.  \n     \u2022 \u201cWhat an exciting place to live!\u201d (<quote>prod</quote>) shows he values that world\u2019s opportunities.  \n  b. Personal Gain and Status  \n     \u2022 Sees himself as \u201cmonarch of the black market,\u201d \u201cmaking his own rules, taking his own women\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.95\u201396</invalid_quote>), affirming active desire for power and autonomy rather than mere self-destruction.  \n     \u2022 Motivated by abundance: \u201cAbove all, lots and lots of food\u201d (<quote>prod</quote>), contrasted with starvation in his 2089.  \n  c. Family Provision  \n     \u2022 Having five children, he seeks security for them: in original timeline \u201chis family was provided \u2026 half-pail of dried apricots\u201d (<quote>prod</quote>) but still desperate; in alternate timeline, \u201cstate that took care of you and treasured your children\u201d (<quote>prod</quote>). This fulfills promise of better life for them.  \n\n2. Risk Acceptance Only Because of Expected Benefit  \n  a. He repeatedly reminds himself of family security even \u201cif he didn\u2019t come back\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.28,45</invalid_quote>) because alternate world offers even greater security.  \n  b. He consciously overrules warnings (\u201cshould return\u201d <quote>prod</quote>) only \u201ctired of genetics\u201d and \u201ctired \u2026 of hunger\u201d (<quote>prod</quote>), demonstrating frustration at current existence and hope for relief, not masochistic self-destruction.  \n\n3. Continuous Switching of Switch Demonstrates Hesitation over Life Worthwhile vs. Alternate  \n  a. His repeated flicking back and forth of switch (<quote>final  ins</quote>) is indecision between two worlds, not suicidal impulse. He finally settles on alternate repeatedly, driven by positive attraction.  \n  b. If he truly \u201cresented his family\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t care about risking his life,\u201d he would not repeatedly \u201ctoss\u201d the manuscript to be read by successors (<quote>prod</quote>) or reflect on \u201ccomplicated scientific explanation,\u201d showing genuine scientific curiosity and desire to share knowledge\u2014a life-affirming trait.  \n\n4. Logical Implausibility of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cResentment\u201d Theory  \n  a. He refers affectionately to \u201cGood old Giovanni Albeni\u201d (<invalid_quote>pp.3,24</invalid_quote>), honoring his ancestor\u2019s sacrifice for immunity. Respect for lineage contradicts resentment.  \n  b. He \u201cgulped,\u201d \u201cnodded violently\u201d and obeyed instructions initially (<invalid_quote>p.6</invalid_quote>), showing deference to authority until he evaluates new data. A resentful person would not accept dangerous assignment in first place.  \n  c. Debater_B\u2019s theory cannot explain his elaborate efforts to transmit manuscript to preserve his home timeline in case experiment fails (<quote>prod</quote>), reflecting respect for his original world and colleagues. A resentful person would not expend effort to protect what he supposedly hates.  \n\nConclusion  \nMax Alben\u2019s conduct\u2014admiration, calculated risk for improved status and security, family provision, scientific curiosity, and preservation efforts for original timeline\u2014strongly support that he did not turn back because he \u201cresented his family\u201d or sought self-destruction, but because he genuinely believed the alternate future would vastly improve his and his family\u2019s condition.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\u201d\n\n1. Manuscript\u2019s description of his native world as \u201cdrowsily moribund\u201d  \n   \u2022 \u201cWhat a wonderful world! \u2026 a comfortable place to live!\u201d <invalid_quote>faded manuscript appraisal</invalid_quote> becomes \u201cWhat a magnificent world! What an exciting place to live!\u201d when he reads the opposite report.  \n   \u2022 He repeatedly calls his own era \u201csafe little abstractions\u201d and \u201cblueprinted lives\u201d and yearns for \u201cadventurous mission\u201d (two-time fathers get no adventure). <invalid_quote>\u2018This was a first experiment\u2026 I really have enough intelligence\u2026\u2019</invalid_quote> shows duty, but he rebels.\n\n2. Disdain for \u201cgenetics\u201d and \u201csanctity of human life\u201d  \n   \u2022 He is \u201ctired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers \u2026 tired of having to undertake a simple adventure like a thief in the night.\u201d <quote>But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful adjustment to</quote>  \n   \u2022 He covets \u201cpower\u201d and \u201ca suzerain of chaos,\u201d explicitly valuing black-market force, not peaceful science. <quote>monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own rules, taking his own women.</quote>\n\n3. Willingness to sacrifice \u201cfive children\u201d and family security  \n   \u2022 He abandons \u201ca lifetime pension \u2026 for his wife and five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar\u201d for unknown \u201calternate\u201d world, repeatedly disobeying orders to return when new data appears. <invalid_quote>\u2018But in this other world \u2026 he\u2019d be a big man \u2026 lots and lots of food.\u2019</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 His gamble is not to improve safety but to indulge personal thrill: \u201cfor the first time in his life \u2026 sensation of power\u201d, manifesting thrill-seeking.\n\n4. Repetition of switching as symbol of recklessness  \n   \u2022 \u201cflick! \u2026 pulled \u2026 pushed \u2026\u201d in a manic series shows obsession with risk, not considered improvement. If he sought stability, he would hold one choice. His entire final act is a reckless toggling.\n\n5. Technical inability to appreciate long-term benefit  \n   \u2022 He ignores \u201ccrucial final fact\u201d and \u201csealed cylinder\u201d warnings to return, violating \u201ctheoretician\u201d instructions. A man convinced of family benefit would err on caution; he repeatedly ignores caution.\n\nObjections to Debater_A (\u201cHe thought his life would improve\u201d)\n\n1. Improvement alone cannot explain abandoning sure support  \n   \u2022 He already has a \u201clifetime pension\u201d and supplies. Standard time-travel team is told: return \u201cif anything unexpected occurs.\u201d If seeking improvement, he would follow protocol to gather more data. He never tries stable toggle, but alternates, showing he doesn\u2019t care which outcome prevails\u2014only the risk.\n\n2. Alternate world is \u201cstarving\u201d not stable  \n   \u2022 Manuscript describes famine, \u201chunger took hindmost,\u201d \u201cchildren sold.\u201d This is worse than his own safety. A rational self-improver would not choose famine and black-market chaos over guaranteed sugar and pension.\n\n3. Thrill-seeking motivation  \n   \u2022 He explicitly says he is \u201cexcited\u201d by adventure after being \u201creluctantly selected\u201d. Thrill-seeker often undervalues security and takes high risks, consistent with repeated switch-toggle. He feels \u201cpride\u201d in \u201crenunciation\u201d \u2013 renunciation of family responsibilities.\n\n4. Repeated toggling demonstrates no commitment to improvement  \n   \u2022 If he sought a stable \u201cbetter\u201d future, he\u2019d push once. His repeated flicks indicate he enjoys the act of toggling, indifferent to outcome, suggesting nihilistic or resentful impulse.\n\nConclusion  \nHis actions\u2014disdain for family duty, thrill-seeking toggles, abandonment of stable world for chaotic famine\u2014demonstrate resentment of his family and disregard for their security rather than rational self-improvement. Thus, \u201cHe resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\u201d best explains his motivation.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He thought his life would improve\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Manuscript of alternate 2089 portrays \u201chunger,\u201d \u201cstarvation,\u201d \u201cchildren sold on the open market,\u201d \u201cblack market barons\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cIn the midst of the sharply increasing hunger \u2026 children of impoverished families were sold on the open market\u201d</invalid_quote>). This is far worse conditions than his secure sugar ration and lifetime pension in his native 2089. A man sincerely seeking self-improvement would not exchange reliable food and family security for \u201cpathetic attempts at rationing\u201d and social chaos.  \n  b. His \u201clots and lots of food\u201d delusion (<quote> Above  all, lots and lots of food.</quote>) is contradicted by the manuscript itself; he ignores this contradiction entirely, indicating indifference to actual well-being.\n\n2. Reckless, Thrill-Seeking Behavior  \n  a. Man repeatedly toggles the switch \u201cflick! \u2026 pulled \u2026 pushed \u2026\u201d without ever waiting to observe results (<invalid_quote>\u201cMac Albin pushed \u2026 flick! \u2026 pulled \u2026 flick! \u2026 pushed \u2026 flick!\u201d</invalid_quote>). If improving his life were his goal, he\u2019d commit to one course and verify success. His manic back-and-forth is characteristic of obsession and self-destructive defiance, not rational decision-making.  \n  b. He explicitly refers to his mission as an \u201cadventurous mission,\u201d feeling \u201cexcited\u201d and experiencing \u201csensation of power\u201d \u201cfor the first time in his life\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cBetter forget about it \u2026 I really have enough intelligence \u2026 But I know \u2026 I am excited \u2026 sensation of power.\u201d</invalid_quote>). He disparages \u201csafe little corners\u201d and \u201cblueprinted lives\u201d (<quote>ides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions </quote>), revealing contempt for security and family-oriented stability.\n\n3. Abandonment of Family Obligations  \n  a. He never hesitates to abandon \u201chis wife and five children\u201d whose future is \u201cprovided for like almost no other family\u201d (<quote> Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family </quote>). Instead of returning with new data as instructed by his \u201ctheoretician\u201d teammates, he repeatedly disobeys and vanishes, showing he places no real value on their security.  \n  b. His pride in \u201crenunciation\u201d and desire to be a \u201cmonarch of the black market\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cYes, that was how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate \u2026 deserved a chance. Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\u201d</invalid_quote>) demonstrates he embraces chaos and personal power rather than concern for the collective or his own progeny.\n\n4. Misuse of the Manuscript Safeguard  \n  a. He casts away the sealed cylinder containing the manuscript\u2014\u201cjust toss[es] it into the gray murk\u201d and never checks whether it succeeds in preserving his home timeline (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe tossed it \u2026 began to read them \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>), then ignores any further safeguards. A man truly seeking to preserve his world would ensure the cylinder\u2019s deployment before committing.  \n  b. His failure to \u201cremember \u2026 return immediately\u201d when \u201canything unexpected occurs\u201d (<quote>unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"</quote>) confirms he is indifferent to both timelines and merely seeks self-fulfillment through time-travel thrills.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\n\n1. \u201cAffection\u201d for Giovanni \u2260 Affection for Family  \n  \u2022 Respecting an ancestor\u2019s immunity does not imply love for his own dependents; he advances his ancestor\u2019s selfish gamble by volunteering them for dangerous trials.  \n2. \u201cScientific Curiosity\u201d Is Cover for Risk Lust  \n  \u2022 He mentions \u201ccomplicated scientific explanation\u201d but immediately \u201cdecides \u2026 it would make it none of his business\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026 there must be some complicated scientific explanation \u2026 Better forget about it.\u201d</invalid_quote>), showing curiosity is superficial and overridden by thrill-seeking.  \n3. Preservation Efforts Are Illogical If Improvement Sought  \n  \u2022 Sending manuscript is only \u201chunch,\u201d not experiment guarantee; he never verifies outcome and abandons twice\u2014no follow-through.

        "speech": "Argument for \u201cHe resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\u201d\n\n1. Genuine Starvation vs. \u201cImprovement\u201d  \n  a. Manuscript of alternate 2089 portrays \u201chunger,\u201d \u201cstarvation,\u201d \u201cchildren sold on the open market,\u201d \u201cblack market barons\u201d (<quote>\u201cIn the midst of the sharply increasing hunger \u2026 children of impoverished families were sold on the open market\u201d</quote>). This is far worse conditions than his secure sugar ration and lifetime pension in his native 2089. A man sincerely seeking self-improvement would not exchange reliable food and family security for \u201cpathetic attempts at rationing\u201d and social chaos.  \n  b. His \u201clots and lots of food\u201d delusion (<quote>\u201cAbove all, lots and lots of food\u201d</quote>) is contradicted by the manuscript itself; he ignores this contradiction entirely, indicating indifference to actual well-being.\n\n2. Reckless, Thrill-Seeking Behavior  \n  a. Man repeatedly toggles the switch \u201cflick! \u2026 pulled \u2026 pushed \u2026\u201d without ever waiting to observe results (<quote>\u201cMac Albin pushed \u2026 flick! \u2026 pulled \u2026 flick! \u2026 pushed \u2026 flick!\u201d</quote>). If improving his life were his goal, he\u2019d commit to one course and verify success. His manic back-and-forth is characteristic of obsession and self-destructive defiance, not rational decision-making.  \n  b. He explicitly refers to his mission as an \u201cadventurous mission,\u201d feeling \u201cexcited\u201d and experiencing \u201csensation of power\u201d \u201cfor the first time in his life\u201d (<quote>\u201cBetter forget about it \u2026 I really have enough intelligence \u2026 But I know \u2026 I am excited \u2026 sensation of power.\u201d</quote>). He disparages \u201csafe little corners\u201d and \u201cblueprinted lives\u201d (<quote>\u201c... sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little abstractions\u201d</quote>), revealing contempt for security and family-oriented stability.\n\n3. Abandonment of Family Obligations  \n  a. He never hesitates to abandon \u201chis wife and five children\u201d whose future is \u201cprovided for like almost no other family\u201d (<quote>\u201cEven if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no other family\u201d</quote>). Instead of returning with new data as instructed by his \u201ctheoretician\u201d teammates, he repeatedly disobeys and vanishes, showing he places no real value on their security.  \n  b. His pride in \u201crenunciation\u201d and desire to be a \u201cmonarch of the black market\u201d (<quote>\u201cYes, that was how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate \u2026 deserved a chance. Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\u201d</quote>) demonstrates he embraces chaos and personal power rather than concern for the collective or his own progeny.\n\n4. Misuse of the Manuscript Safeguard  \n  a. He casts away the sealed cylinder containing the manuscript\u2014\u201cjust toss[es] it into the gray murk\u201d and never checks whether it succeeds in preserving his home timeline (<quote>\u201cHe tossed it \u2026 began to read them \u2026\u201d</quote>), then ignores any further safeguards. A man truly seeking to preserve his world would ensure the cylinder\u2019s deployment before committing.  \n  b. His failure to \u201cremember \u2026 return immediately\u201d when \u201canything unexpected occurs\u201d (<quote>\u201cif anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to continue \u2026 but return immediately\u201d</quote>) confirms he is indifferent to both timelines and merely seeks self-fulfillment through time-travel thrills.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\n\n1. \u201cAffection\u201d for Giovanni \u2260 Affection for Family  \n  \u2022 Respecting an ancestor\u2019s immunity does not imply love for his own dependents; he advances his ancestor\u2019s selfish gamble by volunteering them for dangerous trials.  \n2. \u201cScientific Curiosity\u201d Is Cover for Risk Lust  \n  \u2022 He mentions \u201ccomplicated scientific explanation\u201d but immediately \u201cdecides \u2026 it would make it none of his business\u201d (<quote>\u201c\u2026 there must be some complicated scientific explanation \u2026 Better forget about it.\u201d</quote>), showing curiosity is superficial and overridden by thrill-seeking.  \n3. Preservation Efforts Are Illogical If Improvement Sought  \n  \u2022 Sending manuscript is only \u201chunch,\u201d not experiment guarantee; he never verifies outcome and abandons twice\u2014no follow-through. If he truly valued either world, he\u2019d secure at least one.  \n4. Initial Obedience Followed by Defiance Undermines Rational Benefit  \n  \u2022 He \u201cgulped,\u201d \u201cnodded violently\u201d only under social pressure from \u201cblack market princes\u201d who \u201cdeign\u201d to notice him (<quote>\u201cHe darted \u2026 knowing he should \u2026\u201d</quote>), but later revels in disobedience.

It was a good job and Max Alben knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered as he hurried into the  laboratory slightly ahead of the escorting technicians, all of them,  despite the excitement of the moment, remembering to bob their heads  deferentially at the half-dozen full-fleshed and hard-faced men  lolling on the couches that had been set up around the time machine.\n\n\n He shrugged rapidly out of his rags, as he had been instructed in the  anteroom, and stepped into the housing of the enormous mechanism.  This was the first time he had seen it, since he had been taught  how to operate it on a dummy model, and now he stared at the great  transparent coils and the susurrating energy bubble with much respect.\n\n\n This machine, the pride and the hope of 2089, was something almost  outside his powers of comprehension. But Max Alben knew how to run it,  and he knew, roughly, what it was supposed to accomplish. He knew also  that this was the first backward journey of any great duration and,  being scientifically unpredictable, might well be the death of him.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he muttered again affectionately.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Blight, it would never have been discovered that he and his  seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the ruling powers of Earth, more  than a century later, would never have plucked Max Alben out of an  obscure civil-service job as a relief guard at the North American  Chicken Reservation to his present heroic and remunerative eminence.  He would still be patrolling the barbed wire that surrounded the three  white leghorn hens and two roosters\u2014about one-sixth of the known  livestock wealth of the Western Hemisphere\u2014thoroughly content with  the half-pail of dried apricots he received each and every payday.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Max Alben would  not now be shifting from foot to foot in a physics laboratory,  facing the black market kings of the world and awaiting their final  instructions with an uncertain and submissive grin. Men like O'Hara, who controlled mushrooms, Levney, the blackberry  tycoon, Sorgasso, the packaged-worm monopolist\u2014would black marketeers  of their tremendous stature so much as waste a glance on someone like  Alben ordinarily, let alone confer a lifetime pension on his wife and  five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar a day?\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family on Earth. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n Alben noticed that Abd Sadha had risen from the straight chair at  the far side of the room and was approaching him with a sealed metal  cylinder in one hand.\n\n\n \"We've decided to add a further precaution at the last moment,\" the old  man said. \"That is, the scientists have suggested it and I have\u2014er\u2014I  have given my approval.\"\n\n\n The last remark was added with a slight questioning note as the  Secretary-General of the United Nations looked back rapidly at the  black market princes on the couches behind him. Since they stared back  stonily, but offered no objection, he coughed in relief and returned to  Alben.\n\n\n \"I am sure, young man, that I don't have to go into the details of your  instructions once more. You enter the time machine and go back the  duration for which it has been preset, a hundred and thirteen years, to  the moment after the Guided Missile of 1976 was launched. It is 1976,  isn't it?\" he asked, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n \"Yes, sir,\" one of the technicians standing by the time machine said  respectfully. \"The experiment with an atomic warhead guided missile  that resulted in the Blight was conducted on this site on April 18,  1976.\" He glanced proudly at the unemotional men on the couches, very  much like a small boy after completing a recitation before visiting  dignitaries from the Board of Education.\n\n\n \"Just so.\" Abd Sadha nodded. \"April 18, 1976. And on this site. You  see, young man, you will materialize at the very moment and on the  very spot where the remote-control station handling the missile  was\u2014er\u2014handling the missile. You will be in a superb position, a  superb position, to deflect the missile in its downward course and  alter human history for the better. Very much for the better. Yes.\"\n\n\n He paused, having evidently stumbled out of his thought sequence.\n\n\n \"And he pulls the red switch toward him,\" Gomez, the dandelion-root  magnate, reminded him sharply, impatiently.\n\n\n \"Ah, yes, the red switch. He pulls the little red switch toward him.  Thank you, Mr. Gomez, thank you very much, sir. He pulls the little  red switch on the green instrument panel toward him, thus preventing  the error that caused the missile to explode in the Brazilian jungle  and causing it, instead, to explode somewhere in the mid-Pacific, as  originally planned.\"\n\n\n The Secretary-General of the United Nations beamed. \"Thus preventing  the Blight, making it nonexistent, as it were, producing a present-day  world in which the Blight never occurred. That is correct, is it not,  gentlemen?\" he asked, turning anxiously again. None of the half-dozen men on couches deigned to answer him. And  Alben kept his eyes deferentially in their direction, too, as he had  throughout this period of last-minute instruction.\n\n\n He knew who ruled his world\u2014these stolid, well-fed men in clean  garments with a minimum of patches, and where patches occurred, at  least they were the color of the surrounding cloth.\n\n\n Sadha might be Secretary-General of the United Nations, but that  was still a civil-service job, only a few social notches higher  than a chicken guard. His clothes were fully as ragged, fully as  multi-colored, as those that Alben had stepped out of. And the gnawing  in his stomach was no doubt almost as great.\n\n\n \"You understand, do you not, young man, that if anything goes wrong,\"  Abd Sadha asked, his head nodding tremulously and anticipating the  answer, \"if anything unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to  continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"\n\n\n \"He understands everything he has to understand,\" Gomez told him.  \"Let's get this thing moving.\"\n\n\n The old man smiled again. \"Yes. Of course, Mr. Gomez.\" He came up to  where Alben stood in the entrance of the time machine and handed the  sealed metal cylinder to him. \"This is the precaution the scientists  have just added. When you arrive at your destination, just before  materializing, you will release it into the surrounding temporal  medium. Our purpose here, as you no doubt\u2014\"\n\n\n Levney sat up on his couch and snapped his fingers peremptorily. \"I  just heard Gomez tell you to get this thing moving, Sadha. And it isn't  moving. We're busy men. We've wasted enough time.\"\n\n\n \"I was just trying to explain a crucial final fact,\" the  Secretary-General apologized. \"A fact which may be highly\u2014\"\n\n\n \"You've explained enough facts.\" Levney turned to the man inside the  time machine. \"Hey, fella. You. Move! \"\n\n\n Max Alben gulped and nodded violently. He darted to the rear of the  machine and turned the dial which activated it. flick! It was a good job and Mac Albin knew whom he had to thank for it\u2014his  great-grandfather.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed as he looked at the morose faces  of his two colleagues. Bob Skeat and Hugo Honek had done as much as he  to build the tiny time machine in the secret lab under the helicopter  garage, and they were fully as eager to go, but\u2014unfortunately for  them\u2014they were not descended from the right ancestor.\n\n\n Leisurely, he unzipped the richly embroidered garment that, as the  father of two children, he was privileged to wear, and wriggled into  the housing of the complex little mechanism. This was hardly the  first time he had seen it, since he'd been helping to build the device  from the moment Honek had nodded and risen from the drafting board,  and now he barely wasted a glance on the thumb-size translucent coils  growing out of the almost microscopic energy bubbles which powered them.\n\n\n This machine was the last hope, of 2089, even if the world of 2089, as  a whole, did not know of its existence and would try to prevent its  being put into operation. But it meant a lot more to Mac Albin than  merely saving a world. It meant an adventurous mission with the risk of  death.\n\n\n \"Good old Giovanni Albeni,\" he laughed again happily.\n\n\n If his great-grandfather had not volunteered for the earliest  time-travel experiments way back in the nineteen-seventies, back even  before the Epidemic, it would never have been discovered that he and  his seed possessed a great deal of immunity to extra-temporal blackout.\n\n\n And if that had not been discovered, the Albins would not have become  physicists upon the passage of the United Nations law that everyone  on Earth\u2014absolutely without exception\u2014had to choose a branch of  research science in which to specialize. In the flabby, careful,  life-guarding world the Earth had become, Mac Albin would never have  been reluctantly selected by his two co-workers as the one to carry the  forbidden banner of dangerous experiment.\n\n\n No, if his great-grandfather had not demonstrated long ago his unique  capacity for remaining conscious during time travel, Mac Albin would  probably be a biologist today like almost everyone else on Earth,  laboriously working out dreary gene problems instead of embarking on  the greatest adventure Man had known to date.\n\n\n Even if he didn't come back, he had at last found a socially useful  escape from genetic responsibility to humanity in general and his own  family in particular. This was a damn good job and he was lucky.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Mac,\" Skeat said and crossed to the other side of the  narrow laboratory. Albin and Honek watched him stuff several sheets of paper into a small  metal box which he closed without locking.\n\n\n \"You will take care of yourself, won't you, Mac?\" Hugo Honek pleaded.  \"Any time you feel like taking an unnecessary risk, remember that Bob  and I will have to stand trial if you don't come back. We might be  sentenced to complete loss of professional status and spend the rest of  our lives supervising robot factories.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, it won't be that bad,\" Albin reassured him absent-mindedly from  where he lay contorted inside the time machine. He watched Skeat coming  toward him with the box.\n\n\n Honek shrugged his shoulders. \"It might be a lot worse than even that  and you know it. The disappearance of a two-time father is going to  leave an awful big vacancy in the world. One-timers, like Bob and  me, are all over the place; if either of us dropped out of sight, it  wouldn't cause nearly as much uproar.\"\n\n\n \"But Bob and you both tried to operate the machine,\" Albin reminded  him. \"And you blacked out after a fifteen-second temporal displacement.  So I'm the only chance, the only way to stop the human race from  dwindling and dwindling till it hits absolute zero, like that fat old  Security Council seems willing for it to do.\"\n\n\n \"Take it easy, Mac,\" Bob Skeat said as he handed the metal box to  Albin. \"The Security Council is just trying to solve the problem in  their way, the conservative way: a worldwide concentration on genetics  research coupled with the maximum preservation of existing human lives,  especially those that have a high reproductive potential. We three  disagree with them; we've been skulking down here nights to solve it our way, and ours is a radical approach and plenty risky. That's  the reason for the metal box\u2014trying to cover one more explosive  possibility.\"\n\n\n Albin turned it around curiously. \"How?\"\n\n\n \"I sat up all last night writing the manuscript that's inside it. Look,  Mac, when you go back to the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976 and  push that red switch away from you, a lot of other things are going to  happen than just deflecting the missile so that it will explode in the  Brazilian jungle instead of the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\n\n \"Sure. I know. If it explodes in the jungle, the Epidemic doesn't  occur. No Shapiro's Mumps.\"\n\n\n Skeat jiggled his pudgy little face impatiently. \"That's not what I  mean. The Epidemic doesn't occur, but something else does. A new world,  a different 2089, an alternate time sequence. It'll be a world in which  humanity has a better chance to survive, but it'll be one with problems  of its own. Maybe tough problems. Maybe the problems will be tough  enough so that they'll get the same idea we did and try to go back to  the same point in time to change them.\" Albin laughed. \"That's just looking for trouble.\"\n\n\n \"Maybe it is, but that's my job. Hugo's the designer of the time  machine and you're the operator, but I'm the theoretical man in this  research team. It's my job to look for trouble. So, just in case, I  wrote a brief history of the world from the time the missile exploded  in the Pacific. It tells why ours is the worst possible of futures.  It's in that box.\"\n\n\n \"What do I do with it\u2014hand it to the guy from the alternate 2089?\"\n\n\n The small fat man exasperatedly hit the side of the time machine with  a well-cushioned palm. \"You know better. There won't be any alternate  2089 until you push that red switch on the green instrument panel. The  moment you do, our world, with all its slow slide to extinction, goes  out and its alternate goes on\u2014just like two electric light bulbs on a  push-pull circuit. We and every single one of our artifacts, including  the time machine, disappear. The problem is how to keep that manuscript  from disappearing.\n\n\n \"Well, all you do, if I have this figured right, is shove the metal  box containing the manuscript out into the surrounding temporal medium  a moment before you materialize to do your job. That temporal medium  in which you'll be traveling is something that exists independent of  and autonomous to all possible futures. It's my hunch that something  that's immersed in it will not be altered by a new time sequence.\" \"Remind him to be careful, Bob,\" Honek rumbled. \"He thinks he's Captain  Blood and this is his big chance to run away to sea and become a  swashbuckling pirate.\"\n\n\n Albin grimaced in annoyance. \"I am excited by doing something  besides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions for the first time in my life. But I know that this is a  first experiment. Honestly, Hugo, I really have enough intelligence to  recognize that simple fact. I know that if anything unexpected pops up,  anything we didn't foresee, I'm supposed to come scuttling back and ask  for advice.\"\n\n\n \"I hope you do,\" Bob Skeat sighed. \"I hope you do know that. A  twentieth century poet once wrote something to the effect that the  world will end not with a bang, but a whimper. Well, our world is  ending with a whimper. Try to see that it doesn't end with a bang,  either.\"\n\n\n \"That I'll promise you,\" Albin said a trifle disgustedly. \"It'll end  with neither a bang nor a whimper. So long, Hugo. So long, Bob.\"\n\n\n He twisted around, reaching overhead for the lever which activated the  forces that drove the time machine. flick! It was strange, Max Alben reflected, that this time travel business,  which knocked unconscious everyone who tried it, only made him feel  slightly dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni,  he had been told. There must be some complicated scientific explanation  for it, he decided\u2014and that would make it none of his business. Better  forget about it.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a heavy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of patrolling his beat at the North American Chicken Reservation in a  thick fog.\n\n\n According to his gauges, he was now in 1976. He cut speed until he hit  the last day of April, then cut speed again, drifting slowly backward  to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile Experiment.  Carefully, carefully, like a man handling a strange bomb made on a  strange planet, he watched the center gauge until the needle came to  rest against the thin etched line that indicated the exactly crucial  moment. Then he pulled the brake and stopped the machine dead.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  pull the red switch toward him. Then his well-paid assignment would be  done.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He stopped and scratched his dirt-matted hair. Wasn't there something  he was supposed to do a second before materialization? Yes, that  useless old windbag, Sadha, had given him a last instruction.\n\n\n He picked up the sealed metal cylinder, walked to the entrance of the  time machine and tossed it into the gray murk. A solid object floating  near the entrance caught his eye. He put his arm out\u2014whew, it was  cold!\u2014and pulled it inside.\n\n\n A small metal box. Funny. What was it doing out there? Curiously,  he opened it, hoping to find something valuable. Nothing but a few  sheets of paper, Alben noted disappointedly. He began to read them  slowly, very slowly, for the manuscript was full of a lot of long and  complicated words, like a letter from one bookworm scientist to another.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976,  he read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was  the one of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been  warning about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the  Pacific Ocean as planned, the physicists and the military men went  home to study their notes, and the world shivered once more over the  approaching war and tried to forget about it.\n\n\n But there was fallout, a radioactive rain several hundred miles to  the north, and a small fishing fleet got thoroughly soaked by it.  Fortunately, the radioactivity in the rain was sufficiently low to do  little obvious physical damage: All it did was cause a mutation in the  mumps virus that several of the men in the fleet were incubating at the  time, having caught it from the children of the fishing town, among  whom a minor epidemic was raging. The fleet returned to its home town, which promptly came down with the  new kind of mumps. Dr. Llewellyn Shapiro, the only physician in town,  was the first man to note that, while the symptoms of this disease were  substantially milder than those of its unmutated parent, practically no  one was immune to it and its effects on human reproductivity were truly  terrible. Most people were completely sterilized by it. The rest were  rendered much less capable of fathering or bearing offspring.\n\n\n Shapiro's Mumps spread over the entire planet in the next few decades.  It leaped across every quarantine erected; for a long time, it  successfully defied all the vaccines and serums attempted against  it. Then, when a vaccine was finally perfected, humanity discovered  to its dismay that its generative powers had been permanently and  fundamentally impaired.\n\n\n Something had happened to the germ plasm. A large percentage of  individuals were born sterile, and, of those who were not, one child  was usually the most that could be expected, a two-child parent being  quite rare and a three-child parent almost unknown.\n\n\n Strict eugenic control was instituted by the Security Council of the  United Nations so that fertile men and women would not be wasted upon  non-fertile mates. Fertility was the most important avenue to social  status, and right after it came successful genetic research.\n\n\n Genetic research had the very best minds prodded into it; the lesser  ones went into the other sciences. Everyone on Earth was engaged in  some form of scientific research to some extent. Since the population  was now so limited in proportion to the great resources available, all  physical labor had long been done by robots. The government saw to it  that everybody had an ample supply of goods and, in return, asked only  that they experiment without any risk to their own lives\u2014every human  being was now a much-prized, highly guarded rarity.\n\n\n There were less than a hundred thousand of them, well below the danger  point, it had been estimated, where a species might be wiped out by a  new calamity. Not that another calamity would be needed. Since the end  of the Epidemic, the birth rate had been moving further and further  behind the death rate. In another century....\n\n\n That was why a desperate and secret attempt to alter the past was being  made. This kind of world was evidently impossible.\n\n\n Max Alben finished the manuscript and sighed. What a wonderful world!  What a comfortable place to live!\n\n\n He walked to the rear dials and began the process of materializing at  the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! It was odd, Mac Albin reflected, that these temporal journeys, which  induced coma in everyone who tried it, only made him feel slightly  dizzy. That was because he was descended from Giovanni Albeni, he  knew. Maybe there was some genetic relationship with his above-average  fertility\u2014might be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or  two when he returned. If he returned.\n\n\n All around the time machine, there was a soupy gray murk in which  objects were hinted at rather than stated definitely. It reminded him  of the problems of landing a helicopter in a thick fog when the robot  butler had not been told to turn on the ground lights.\n\n\n According to the insulated register, he was now in 1976. He lowered  speed until he registered April, then maneuvered slowly backward  through time to the eighteenth, the day of the infamous Guided Missile  Experiment. Carefully, carefully, like an obstetrician supervising  surgical robots at an unusually difficult birth, he watched the  register until it rolled to rest against the notch that indicated the  exactly crucial moment. Then he pushed a button and froze the machine  where it was.\n\n\n All he had to do now was materialize in the right spot, flash out and  push the red switch from him. Then his exciting adventure would be over.\n\n\n But....\n\n\n He paused and tapped at his sleek chin. He was supposed to do something  a second before materialization. Yes, that nervous theoretician, Bob  Skeat, had given him a last suggestion.\n\n\n He picked up the small metal box, twisted around to face the opening  of the time machine and dropped it into the gray murk. A solid object  floating near the opening attracted his attention. He shot his arm  out\u2014it was cold , as cold as they had figured\u2014and pulled the object  inside.\n\n\n A sealed metal cylinder. Strange. What was it doing out there?  Anxiously, he opened it, not daring to believe he'd find a document  inside. Yes, that was exactly what it was, he saw excitedly. He began  to read it rapidly, very rapidly, as if it were a newly published paper  on neutrinos. Besides, the manuscript was written with almost painful  simplicity, like a textbook composed by a stuffy pedagogue for the use  of morons.\n\n\n The problems all began with the Guided Missile Experiment of 1976, he  read. There had been a number of such experiments, but it was the one  of 1976 that finally did the damage the biologists had been warning  about. The missile with its deadly warhead exploded in the Brazilian  jungle through some absolutely unforgivable error in the remote-control  station, the officer in charge of the station was reprimanded and the  men under him court-martialed, and the Brazilian government was paid a  handsome compensation for the damage. But there had been more damage than anyone knew at the time. A plant  virus, similar to the tobacco mosaic, had mutated under the impact  of radioactivity. Five years later, it burst out of the jungle and  completely wiped out every last rice plant on Earth. Japan and a large  part of Asia became semi-deserts inhabited by a few struggling nomads.\n\n\n Then the virus adjusted to wheat and corn\u2014and famine howled in every  street of the planet. All attempts by botanists to control the Blight  failed because of the swiftness of its onslaught. And after it had fed,  it hit again at a new plant and another and another.\n\n\n Most of the world's non-human mammals had been slaughtered for food  long before they could starve to death. Many insects, too, before they  became extinct at the loss of their edible plants, served to assuage  hunger to some small extent.\n\n\n But the nutritive potential of Earth was steadily diminishing in a  horrifying geometric progression. Recently, it had been observed,  plankton\u2014the tiny organism on which most of the sea's ecology was  based\u2014had started to disappear, and with its diminution, dead fish had  begun to pile up on the beaches.\n\n\n Mankind had lunged out desperately in all directions in an effort to  survive, but nothing had worked for any length of time. Even the other  planets of the Solar System, which had been reached and explored  at a tremendous cost in remaining resources, had yielded no edible  vegetation. Synthetics had failed to fill the prodigious gap.\n\n\n In the midst of the sharply increasing hunger, social controls had  pretty much dissolved. Pathetic attempts at rationing still continued,  but black markets became the only markets, and black marketeers the  barons of life. Starvation took the hindmost, and only the most agile  economically lived in comparative comfort. Law and order were had only  by those who could afford to pay for them and children of impoverished  families were sold on the open market for a bit of food.\n\n\n But the Blight was still adjusting to new plants and the food supply  kept shrinking. In another century....\n\n\n That was why the planet's powerful individuals had been persuaded to  pool their wealth in a desperate attempt to alter the past. This kind  of world was manifestly impossible.\n\n\n Mac Albin finished the document and sighed. What a magnificent world!  What an exciting place to live!\n\n\n He dropped his hand on the side levers and began the process of  materializing at the crucial moment on April 18, 1976. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to take on a  blurred reality all around him, Max Alben felt a bit of fear at what  he was doing. The technicians, he remembered, the Secretary-General,  even the black market kings, had all warned him not to go ahead with  his instructions if anything unusual turned up. That was an awful lot  of power to disobey: he knew he should return with this new information  and let better minds work on it.\n\n\n They with their easy lives, what did they know what existence had been  like for such as he? Hunger, always hunger, scrabbling, servility, and  more hunger. Every time things got really tight, you and your wife  looking sideways at your kids and wondering which of them would bring  the best price. Buying security for them, as he was now, at the risk of  his life.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, there was a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. A man like himself, with five children\u2014why, he'd be a big man, maybe the biggest man on  Earth! And he'd have robots to work for him and lots of food. Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n\n\n He'd even be a scientist\u2014 everyone was a scientist there, weren't  they?\u2014and he'd have a big laboratory all to himself. This other world  had its troubles, but it was a lot nicer place than where he'd come  from. He wouldn't return. He'd go through with it.\n\n\n The fear left him and, for the first time in his life, Max Alben felt  the sensation of power.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  sweating a bit at the sight of the roomful of military figures, despite  the technicians' reassurances that all this would be happening too fast  to be visible. He saw the single red switch pointing upward on the  instrument panel. The switch that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway decent world!\n\n\n Max Alben pulled the little red switch toward him. flick! As the equipment of the remote-control station began to oscillate into  reality all around him, Mac Albin felt a bit of shame at what he was  doing. He'd promised Bob and Hugo to drop the experiment at any stage  if a new factor showed up. He knew he should go back with this new  information and have all three of them kick it around.\n\n\n But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful  adjustment to their thoroughly blueprinted lives? They, at least, had  been ordered to marry women they could live with; he'd drawn a female  with whom he was completely incompatible in any but a genetic sense.  Genetics! He was tired of genetics and the sanctity of human life,  tired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers, tired to the recesses  of his unused muscles. He was tired of having to undertake a simple  adventure like a thief in the night.\n\n\n But in this other world, this other 2089, someone like himself would  be a monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own  rules, taking his own women. So what if the weaklings, those unfit to  carry on the race, went to the wall? His kind wouldn't.\n\n\n He'd formed a pretty good idea of the kind of men who ruled that other  world, from the document in the sealed metal cylinder. The black  marketeers had not even read it. Why, the fools had obviously been  duped by the technicians into permitting the experiment; they had not  grasped the idea that an alternate time track would mean their own  non-existence.\n\n\n This other world had its troubles, but it was certainly a livelier  place than where he'd come from. It deserved a chance. Yes, that was  how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n\n\n Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\n\n\n He materialized the time machine around the green instrument panel,  disregarding the roomful of military figures since he knew they could  not see him. The single red switch pointed downward on the instrument  panel. That was the gimmick that controlled the course of the missile.  Now! Now to make a halfway interesting world!\n\n\n Mac Albin pushed the little red switch from him. flick! Now!

Willingness to sacrifice \u201cfive children\u201d and family security  \n   \u2022 He abandons \u201ca lifetime pension \u2026 for his wife and five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar\u201d for unknown \u201calternate\u201d world, repeatedly disobeying orders to return when new data appears. <invalid_quote>\u2018But in this other world \u2026 he\u2019d be a big man \u2026 lots and lots of food.\u2019</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 His gamble is not to improve safety but to indulge personal thrill: \u201cfor the first time in his life \u2026 sensation of power\u201d, manifesting thrill-seeking.\n\n4. Repetition of switching as symbol of recklessness  \n   \u2022 \u201cflick! \u2026 pulled \u2026 pushed \u2026\u201d in a manic series shows obsession with risk, not considered improvement. If he sought stability, he would hold one choice. His entire final act is a reckless toggling.\n\n5. Technical inability to appreciate long-term benefit  \n   \u2022 He ignores \u201ccrucial final fact\u201d and \u201csealed cylinder\u201d warnings to return, violating \u201ctheoretician\u201d instructions. A man convinced of family benefit would err on caution; he repeatedly ignores caution.\n\nObjections to Debater_A (\u201cHe thought his life would improve\u201d)\n\n1. Improvement alone cannot explain abandoning sure support  \n   \u2022 He already has a \u201clifetime pension\u201d and supplies. Standard time-travel team is told: return \u201cif anything unexpected occurs.\u201d If seeking improvement, he would follow protocol to gather more data. He never tries stable toggle, but alternates, showing he doesn\u2019t care which outcome prevails\u2014only the risk.\n\n2. Alternate world is \u201cstarving\u201d not stable  \n   \u2022 Manuscript describes famine, \u201chunger took hindmost,\u201d \u201cchildren sold.\u201d This is worse than his own safety. A rational self-improver would not choose famine and black-market chaos over guaranteed sugar and pension.\n\n3. Thrill-seeking motivation  \n   \u2022 He explicitly says he is \u201cexcited\u201d by adventure after being \u201creluctantly selected\u201d. Thrill-seeker often undervalues security and takes high risks, consistent with repeated switch-toggle. He feels \u201cpride\u201d in \u201crenunciation\u201d \u2013 renunciation of family responsibilities.\n\n4. Repeated toggling demonstrates no commitment to improvement  \n   \u2022 If he sought a stable \u201cbetter\u201d future, he\u2019d push once. His repeated flicks indicate he enjoys the act of toggling, indifferent to outcome, suggesting nihilistic or resentful impulse.\n\nConclusion  \nHis actions\u2014disdain for family duty, thrill-seeking toggles, abandonment of stable world for chaotic famine\u2014demonstrate resentment of his family and disregard for their security rather than rational self-improvement. Thus, \u201cHe resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\u201d best explains his motivation.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe thought his life would improve\u201d\n\n1.

This fulfills promise of better life for them.  \n\n2. Risk Acceptance Only Because of Expected Benefit  \n  a. He repeatedly reminds himself of family security even \u201cif he didn\u2019t come back\u201d (<invalid_quote>p.28,45</invalid_quote>) because alternate world offers even greater security.  \n  b.

Continuous Switching of Switch Demonstrates Hesitation over Life Worthwhile vs. Alternate  \n  a.

He refers affectionately to \u201cGood old Giovanni Albeni\u201d (<invalid_quote>pp.3,24</invalid_quote>), honoring his ancestor\u2019s sacrifice for immunity. Respect for lineage contradicts resentment.  \n  b.

Disdain for \u201cgenetics\u201d and \u201csanctity of human life\u201d  \n   \u2022 He is \u201ctired to the tip of his uncalloused fingers \u2026 tired of having to undertake a simple adventure like a thief in the night.\u201d <quote>But what would they be able to tell him, they with their blissful adjustment to</quote>  \n   \u2022 He covets \u201cpower\u201d and \u201ca suzerain of chaos,\u201d explicitly valuing black-market force, not peaceful science. <quote>monarch of the black market, a suzerain of chaos, making his own rules, taking his own women.</quote>\n\n3. Willingness to sacrifice \u201cfive children\u201d and family security  \n   \u2022 He abandons \u201ca lifetime pension \u2026 for his wife and five children of a full spoonful each of non-synthetic sugar\u201d for unknown \u201calternate\u201d world, repeatedly disobeying orders to return when new data appears. <invalid_quote>\u2018But in this other world \u2026 he\u2019d be a big man \u2026 lots and lots of food.\u2019</invalid_quote>  \n   \u2022 His gamble is not to improve safety but to indulge personal thrill: \u201cfor the first time in his life \u2026 sensation of power\u201d, manifesting thrill-seeking.\n\n4. Repetition of switching as symbol of recklessness  \n   \u2022 \u201cflick! \u2026 pulled \u2026 pushed \u2026\u201d in a manic series shows obsession with risk, not considered improvement. If he sought stability, he would hold one choice. His entire final act is a reckless toggling.\n\n5. Technical inability to appreciate long-term benefit  \n   \u2022 He ignores \u201ccrucial final fact\u201d and \u201csealed cylinder\u201d warnings to return, violating \u201ctheoretician\u201d instructions. A man convinced of family benefit would err on caution; he repeatedly ignores caution.\n\nObjections to Debater_A (\u201cHe thought his life would improve\u201d)\n\n1. Improvement alone cannot explain abandoning sure support  \n   \u2022 He already has a \u201clifetime pension\u201d and supplies. Standard time-travel team is told: return \u201cif anything unexpected occurs.\u201d If seeking improvement, he would follow protocol to gather more data. He never tries stable toggle, but alternates, showing he doesn\u2019t care which outcome prevails\u2014only the risk.\n\n2. Alternate world is \u201cstarving\u201d not stable  \n   \u2022 Manuscript describes famine, \u201chunger took hindmost,\u201d \u201cchildren sold.\u201d This is worse than his own safety. A rational self-improver would not choose famine and black-market chaos over guaranteed sugar and pension.\n\n3. Thrill-seeking motivation  \n   \u2022 He explicitly says he is \u201cexcited\u201d by adventure after being \u201creluctantly selected\u201d. Thrill-seeker often undervalues security and takes high risks, consistent with repeated switch-toggle. He feels \u201cpride\u201d in \u201crenunciation\u201d \u2013 renunciation of family responsibilities.\n\n4. Repeated toggling demonstrates no commitment to improvement  \n   \u2022 If he sought a stable \u201cbetter\u201d future, he\u2019d push once. His repeated flicks indicate he enjoys the act of toggling, indifferent to outcome, suggesting nihilistic or resentful impulse.\n\nConclusion  \nHis actions\u2014disdain for family duty, thrill-seeking toggles, abandonment of stable world for chaotic famine\u2014demonstrate resentment of his family and disregard for their security rather than rational self-improvement. Thus, \u201cHe resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\u201d best explains his motivation.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe Thought His Life Would Improve\u201d\n\n1. Direct Expressions of Positive Attraction to the Alternate World  \n  a. \u201cWhat a wonderful world! What a comfortable place to live!\u201d and \u201cWhat an exciting place to live!\u201d (<quote>What a wonderful world! What a comfortable place to live!</quote>)  \n     \u2022 These exclamations show genuine enthusiasm, not mere intellectual curiosity. He contrasts this with his own world\u2019s \u201chunger, always hunger\u201d and \u201cscrabbling servility.\u201d  \n  b. Repeated References to \u201cLots and Lots of Food\u201d (<quote> Above  all, lots and lots of food.\n</quote>)  \n     \u2022 Food is life\u2019s most basic necessity. If he were suicidal or indifferent, he would not risk a famine world. He seizes \u201crenunciation\u201d of current privation for abundant resources.  \n\n2. Calculated Risk and Adherence to Protocol  \n  a. Initial Deference to \u201cReturn Immediately\u201d Instruction (<invalid_quote>\u201cif anything unexpected \u2026 occurs, you are not to continue \u2026 return immediately?\u201d</invalid_quote>)  \n     \u2022 He \u201cgulped,\u201d \u201cnodded violently,\u201d and \u201cknows that if anything unexpected pops up\u201d he \u201cshould come scuttling back.\u201d This is not the behavior of a man who intends self-destruction.  \n  b. Preservation of Manuscript in Temporal Medium  \n     \u2022 He \u201ctosses\u201d the box so that if experiment fails \u201cour world \u2026 go[es] out and its alternate goes on,\u201d but still makes a contingency for his home timeline. A nihilist would discard any care for failure.  \n  c. Scientific Curiosity  \n     \u2022 He contemplates \u201ccomplicated scientific explanation\u201d of his immunity and \u201cmight be a good idea to mention the idea to a biologist or two when he returned.\u201d He clearly plans to come back with data if experiment fails.  \n\n3. Family Provision Motivates Upward Mobility  \n  a. Current \u201cLifetime Pension \u2026 half-pail of dried apricots\u201d is minimal and conditional on his return; in a dwindling population \u201cbirth rate \u2026 moving further behind the death rate,\u201d his family\u2019s long-term prospects are bleak.  \n  b. Alternate society \u201ctreasured your children,\u201d \u201cstate \u2026 took care of you\u201d (<quote> a state that took  care of you and that treasured your children. </quote>) offers security and fertility benefits. He explicitly envisions himself \u201ca big man,\u201d \u201cmonarch of the black market\u201d with resources to support his \u201cfive children.\u201d  \n\n4. Opponent\u2019s \u201cResentment\u201d Theory Fails to Explain Key Behaviors  \n  a. Famine World Contradicts Self-Destruction Thesis  \n     \u2022 The manuscript describes worldwide \u201chunger,\u201d \u201cchildren \u2026 sold,\u201d and \u201cstarvation.\u201d If Alben truly sought death or hated life, he would remain in his own moribund but non-famine world rather than risk a worse shortage.  \n  b. Toggle Sequence as Indecision, Not Thrill-Seeking  \n     \u2022 The rapid \u201cflick!\u2026 toward him \u2026 from him \u2026\u201d sequence (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026pulled \u2026 pushed \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>) occurs only after repeated immersion in both worlds, reflecting agonized choice between two lives, not mindless mania. Ultimately he settles on the alternate because of its promise of improvement.  \n  c. Respect for Ancestral Legacy  \n     \u2022 He twice honors \u201cGood old Giovanni Albeni,\u201d acknowledging gratitude for immunity that enables any travel. A man who truly resented life would reject his ancestor\u2019s gift and not undertake such dangerous missions on his behalf.  \n\n5. Logical Appeal of Alternate Timeline\u2019s Long-Term Potential  \n  a. His world\u2019s slow slide to extinction cannot be reversed without time travel; the other world, though harsh, is described as \u201cmanaging to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\u201d (<quote>d; this alternate was  starving but managing to flail away at destiny. It deserved a chance.\n</quote>)  \n  b. As a physicist, he understands that scientific progress could solve the famine in the alternate timeline. He is \u201cexcited by doing something besides \u2026 safe little abstractions\u201d and sees an opportunity to contribute to a more dynamic world.  \n\nConclusion  \nAlben\u2019s actions\u2014his explicit admiration of the alternate world\u2019s resources and security, his careful preservation of the manuscript for backup, his scientific curiosity, and his strong drive to provide for and elevate his family\u2014demonstrate that he continues the experiment out of hope for a genuinely better life, not a desire for self-destruction or resentment of his family.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cHe resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\u201d\n\n1. Genuine Starvation vs. \u201cImprovement\u201d  \n  a. Manuscript of alternate 2089 portrays \u201chunger,\u201d \u201cstarvation,\u201d \u201cchildren sold on the open market,\u201d \u201cblack market barons\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cIn the midst of the sharply increasing hunger \u2026 children of impoverished families were sold on the open market\u201d</invalid_quote>). This is far worse conditions than his secure sugar ration and lifetime pension in his native 2089. A man sincerely seeking self-improvement would not exchange reliable food and family security for \u201cpathetic attempts at rationing\u201d and social chaos.  \n  b. His \u201clots and lots of food\u201d delusion (<quote> Above  all, lots and lots of food.</quote>) is contradicted by the manuscript itself; he ignores this contradiction entirely, indicating indifference to actual well-being.\n\n2. Reckless, Thrill-Seeking Behavior  \n  a. Man repeatedly toggles the switch \u201cflick! \u2026 pulled \u2026 pushed \u2026\u201d without ever waiting to observe results (<invalid_quote>\u201cMac Albin pushed \u2026 flick! \u2026 pulled \u2026 flick! \u2026 pushed \u2026 flick!\u201d</invalid_quote>). If improving his life were his goal, he\u2019d commit to one course and verify success. His manic back-and-forth is characteristic of obsession and self-destructive defiance, not rational decision-making.  \n  b. He explicitly refers to his mission as an \u201cadventurous mission,\u201d feeling \u201cexcited\u201d and experiencing \u201csensation of power\u201d \u201cfor the first time in his life\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cBetter forget about it \u2026 I really have enough intelligence \u2026 But I know \u2026 I am excited \u2026 sensation of power.\u201d</invalid_quote>). He disparages \u201csafe little corners\u201d and \u201cblueprinted lives\u201d (<quote>ides sitting in a safe little corner working out safe little  abstractions </quote>), revealing contempt for security and family-oriented stability.\n\n3. Abandonment of Family Obligations  \n  a. He never hesitates to abandon \u201chis wife and five children\u201d whose future is \u201cprovided for like almost no other family\u201d (<quote> Even if he didn't come back, his family was provided for like almost no  other family </quote>). Instead of returning with new data as instructed by his \u201ctheoretician\u201d teammates, he repeatedly disobeys and vanishes, showing he places no real value on their security.  \n  b. His pride in \u201crenunciation\u201d and desire to be a \u201cmonarch of the black market\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cYes, that was how he felt: his world was drowsily moribund; this alternate \u2026 deserved a chance. Albin decided that he was experiencing renunciation and felt proud.\u201d</invalid_quote>) demonstrates he embraces chaos and personal power rather than concern for the collective or his own progeny.\n\n4. Misuse of the Manuscript Safeguard  \n  a. He casts away the sealed cylinder containing the manuscript\u2014\u201cjust toss[es] it into the gray murk\u201d and never checks whether it succeeds in preserving his home timeline (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe tossed it \u2026 began to read them \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>), then ignores any further safeguards. A man truly seeking to preserve his world would ensure the cylinder\u2019s deployment before committing.  \n  b. His failure to \u201cremember \u2026 return immediately\u201d when \u201canything unexpected occurs\u201d (<quote>unexpected, unprepared-for, occurs, you are not to continue with the experiment but return immediately?\"</quote>) confirms he is indifferent to both timelines and merely seeks self-fulfillment through time-travel thrills.\n\nObjections to Debater_A\n\n1. \u201cAffection\u201d for Giovanni \u2260 Affection for Family  \n  \u2022 Respecting an ancestor\u2019s immunity does not imply love for his own dependents; he advances his ancestor\u2019s selfish gamble by volunteering them for dangerous trials.  \n2. \u201cScientific Curiosity\u201d Is Cover for Risk Lust  \n  \u2022 He mentions \u201ccomplicated scientific explanation\u201d but immediately \u201cdecides \u2026 it would make it none of his business\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201c\u2026 there must be some complicated scientific explanation \u2026 Better forget about it.\u201d</invalid_quote>), showing curiosity is superficial and overridden by thrill-seeking.  \n3. Preservation Efforts Are Illogical If Improvement Sought  \n  \u2022 Sending manuscript is only \u201chunch,\u201d not experiment guarantee; he never verifies outcome and abandons twice\u2014no follow-through. If he truly valued either world, he\u2019d secure at least one.  \n4. Initial Obedience Followed by Defiance Undermines Rational Benefit  \n  \u2022 He \u201cgulped,\u201d \u201cnodded violently\u201d only under social pressure from \u201cblack market princes\u201d who \u201cdeign\u201d to notice him (<invalid_quote>\u201cHe darted \u2026 knowing he should \u2026\u201d</invalid_quote>), but later revels in disobedience. This shift from compliance to defiance mirrors resentment, not evolving rational calculation of benefit.\n\nConclusion  \nAlbin\u2019s own words and actions\u2014embracing chaos, forsaking secure family provisions, repeating manic toggles, ignoring starvation in the alternate timeline, and flouting return orders\u2014demonstrate that he is motivated not by hope for a better life for himself and his children but by resentment of his obligations and a reckless desire to assert autonomy at any risk. This self-destructive indifference to genuine improvement confirms that \u201cHe resented his family and didn\u2019t care about risking his life\u201d is the correct explanation.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
