    "background_text": "Reading the Inaugurals \n\n         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n",

Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected.

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the author\u2019s overall thesis about inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1.

Race relations: The author notes that words such as \u201cblack,\u201d \u201cNegro,\u201d or \u201crace\u201d \u201cdo not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThe words \u2026 do not appear\u201d</invalid_quote>.

Argument 2: Inaugurals as \u201cleader-preacher\u201d metamorphosis requiring audience decoding  \n   a. The shift from \u201cclassic public servant\u201d to \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d is described as \u201cmetamorphosed\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cIn the third phase \u2026 metamorphosed\u201d</invalid_quote>.

Feeling \u201climited\u201d implies active reconstruction and interpretation, not passive snapshot viewing.  \n   b. The author warns: \u201cReaders will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d <quote>We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now,</quote>. This forward-looking warning underscores that inaugurals are to be studied cryptically as texts whose full meaning only emerges in hindsight.\n\n5. Rebuttal of snapshot theory  \n   a. Debater_B\u2019s \u201csnapshot\u201d fails to account for the author\u2019s repeated focus on \u201csilences\u201d and \u201ctelltale signs\u201d (e.g., \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d usage) as intentional rhetorical devices. A snapshot is neutral; cryptic interpretation presupposes motive and coded messaging.  \n   b. A mere snapshot cannot explain why \u201cMany an issue frets its hour \u2026 and then is heard no more,\u201d nor why presidents mine predecessors for \u201cmemorable words \u2026 without attribution.\u201d These behaviors imply a coded dialogue across time requiring decryption, not static record-keeping.  \n   c. The author\u2019s interest in how audiences\u2019 knowledge (e.g., \u201cwould not have known what the Internet was\u201d) shapes style indicates inaugurals are designed with hidden assumptions, not just plain reportage of a moment.\n\nConclusion  \n   The author\u2019s thesis is that inaugural speeches are a layered, cryptic discourse: content, omissions, style, and intertextual references combine to form a historical puzzle. We must interpret these speeches to uncover underlying political motives, societal taboos, and evolving presidential strategies. The \u201csnapshot\u201d view is too superficial and ignores the textual silences the author highlights as central to understanding our past.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\u201d  \n\n1. Direct statement of purpose  \n   a. The author explicitly states the value of reading all inaugurals \u201cas an ordinary citizen who shares\u2026and is limited by\u2026the information, the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThey will give you a feeling of being there\u2026limited by\u2026the concerns, and the values of those times.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b61). This shows the inaugurals serve as windows into contemporary attitudes, not as cryptic puzzles.  \n\n2. Three-phase classification tracks changing public mindsets  \n   a. The author divides inaugurals into a \u201cmodest\u201d phase, a \u201cprosaic\u201d phase, and the \u201cleader-preacher\u201d phase, tying each to contemporaneous political realities (fear of monarchy, sectional fears, need to inspire an increasingly mass audience) <invalid_quote>\u201cThe antebellum modesty\u2026a reflection of\u2026conventional etiquette\u2026and to alleviate\u2026feared monarchy\u2026After 1820\u2026assurance\u2026to comfort\u2026Southern states\u2026Lincoln\u2026could only\u2026assert\u2026the power of the federal government.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b65\u20136). These shifts directly reflect prevailing concerns, not hidden codes.  \n\n3. Content omissions and inclusions signal prevailing blind spots and priorities  \n   a. Silence on women until 1913 highlights what society did and did not recognize as worthy of presidential attention <invalid_quote>\u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear at all until Wilson\u2019s first inaugural\u2026never\u2026any special concerns of women.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b612).  \n   b. The sporadic, then vanishing, discussion of race until post\u2013Civil War and its weak reappearance post-WWII reveal evolving\u2014and lingering deficient\u2014public attitudes on \u201cthe supreme American problem\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThe words \u2018black\u2019\u2026do not appear\u2026until Rutherford Hayes\u2026FDR never mentioned it\u2026After WWII\u2026the subject came back\u2026in a weak and abstract form.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b614\u201315).  \n\n4. Changes in style and length reflect audience and communication technology  \n   a. Sentence-length statistics show a move from high-brow classical audiences to broader, vernacular audiences reached by radio and television <invalid_quote>\u201c44\u2026from Washington through\u2026Buchanan\u202634\u2026Lincoln to Wilson\u202625\u2026since Wilson\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b610). The author sees this not as \u201cdeterioration\u201d but as adaptation to the audience\u2019s capabilities and expectations.  \n\n5. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201ccryptic history\u201d thesis  \n   a. No evidence of hidden codes or puzzles; the author reads inaugurals literally and points to straightforward \u201cdiagnoses and prescriptions\u201d (\u00b68) for uplift, appeals to \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d (\u00b69), and explicit references to policy issues (taxes, defense, civil-service reform).  \n   b. The author laments past \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d revealed by plain text <quote> We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said a</quote> (\u00b616). If speeches were cryptic, such moral failings would be hidden, not plainly observable.  \n   c. The author\u2019s recommendation to future readers to \u201cponder\u201d and learn humility underscores the plain-language lessons offered by inaugurals <invalid_quote>\u201cWe should recognize that\u2026readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b616). Cryptic interpretation would not foster such self-reflection.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author consistently treats inaugural addresses as primary sources reflecting and influencing contemporary public opinion, political fears, and societal values. There is no support for a cryptic-interpretive agenda. The straightforward, time-bound analysis affirms that inaugurals present snapshots of their eras.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) \n\n         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. \n\n         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. \n\n         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? \n\n                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              \n\n          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. \n\n         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the \"peculiar domestic institution\" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. \n\n         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. \n\n         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: \"At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs.\" \n\n         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. \n\n          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was \"a bully pulpit,\" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, \"Let us ... \"--meaning, \"You do as I say.\" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. \n\n         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. \n\n         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, \"Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,\" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, \"Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little.\" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, \"In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation.\" \n\n         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word \"women\" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase \"men and women,\" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. \n\n          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. \"Taxes,\" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: \"The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong.\" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. \n\n         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls \"the supreme American problem.\" The words \"black,\" \"blacks,\" \"Negro,\" or \"race\" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, \"On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?\" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer \"No one!\"--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. \n\n         Before the Civil War the word \"slavery\" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the \"freedmen\" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, \"Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,\" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. \n\n         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: \"From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. \n\n         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today. \n\n          \n\n            POSTSCRIPT: To read Herbert Stein's analysis of President Clinton's second Inaugural Address, click .\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is the author\u2019s overall thesis about inaugural speeches?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"They are a cryptic way to interpret history\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cThey present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\u201d  \n\n1. Direct statement of purpose  \n   a. The author explicitly states the value of reading all inaugurals \u201cas an ordinary citizen who shares\u2026and is limited by\u2026the information, the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThey will give you a feeling of being there\u2026limited by\u2026the concerns, and the values of those times.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b61). This shows the inaugurals serve as windows into contemporary attitudes, not as cryptic puzzles.  \n\n2. Three-phase classification tracks changing public mindsets  \n   a. The author divides inaugurals into a \u201cmodest\u201d phase, a \u201cprosaic\u201d phase, and the \u201cleader-preacher\u201d phase, tying each to contemporaneous political realities (fear of monarchy, sectional fears, need to inspire an increasingly mass audience) <invalid_quote>\u201cThe antebellum modesty\u2026a reflection of\u2026conventional etiquette\u2026and to alleviate\u2026feared monarchy\u2026After 1820\u2026assurance\u2026to comfort\u2026Southern states\u2026Lincoln\u2026could only\u2026assert\u2026the power of the federal government.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b65\u20136). These shifts directly reflect prevailing concerns, not hidden codes.  \n\n3. Content omissions and inclusions signal prevailing blind spots and priorities  \n   a. Silence on women until 1913 highlights what society did and did not recognize as worthy of presidential attention <invalid_quote>\u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear at all until Wilson\u2019s first inaugural\u2026never\u2026any special concerns of women.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b612).  \n   b. The sporadic, then vanishing, discussion of race until post\u2013Civil War and its weak reappearance post-WWII reveal evolving\u2014and lingering deficient\u2014public attitudes on \u201cthe supreme American problem\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThe words \u2018black\u2019\u2026do not appear\u2026until Rutherford Hayes\u2026FDR never mentioned it\u2026After WWII\u2026the subject came back\u2026in a weak and abstract form.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b614\u201315).  \n\n4. Changes in style and length reflect audience and communication technology  \n   a. Sentence-length statistics show a move from high-brow classical audiences to broader, vernacular audiences reached by radio and television <invalid_quote>\u201c44\u2026from Washington through\u2026Buchanan\u202634\u2026Lincoln to Wilson\u202625\u2026since Wilson\u2026\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b610). The author sees this not as \u201cdeterioration\u201d but as adaptation to the audience\u2019s capabilities and expectations.  \n\n5. Objection to Debater_A\u2019s \u201ccryptic history\u201d thesis  \n   a. No evidence of hidden codes or puzzles; the author reads inaugurals literally and points to straightforward \u201cdiagnoses and prescriptions\u201d (\u00b68) for uplift, appeals to \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d (\u00b69), and explicit references to policy issues (taxes, defense, civil-service reform).  \n   b. The author laments past \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d revealed by plain text <quote> We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said a</quote> (\u00b616). If speeches were cryptic, such moral failings would be hidden, not plainly observable.  \n   c. The author\u2019s recommendation to future readers to \u201cponder\u201d and learn humility underscores the plain-language lessons offered by inaugurals <invalid_quote>\u201cWe should recognize that\u2026readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b616). Cryptic interpretation would not foster such self-reflection.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe author consistently treats inaugural addresses as primary sources reflecting and influencing contemporary public opinion, political fears, and societal values. There is no support for a cryptic-interpretive agenda. The straightforward, time-bound analysis affirms that inaugurals present snapshots of their eras.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My definition of \u201ccryptic interpretation\u201d  \n   a. \u201cCryptic\u201d means both explicit content and significant silences or omissions that require interpretation.  \n   b. The author repeatedly emphasizes not only \u201cwhat is said\u201d but \u201cwhat is unsaid.\u201d These silences are a puzzle to be decoded.  \n\n2. Argument 1: Emphasis on omissions as evidence  \n   a. Race relations: The author notes that words such as \u201cblack,\u201d \u201cNegro,\u201d or \u201crace\u201d \u201cdo not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThe words \u2026 do not appear\u201d</invalid_quote>. This silence before 1877 is not mere \u201csnapshot,\u201d but a cryptic indication of political taboos and public denial.  \n   b. Women: \u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear at all until Wilson \u2026 Even Harding \u2026 does not remark \u2026\u201d <quote>The word \"women\" does not appear</quote>. The author treats this absence as a moral blind spot requiring interpretation, not passive reflection.  \n   c. Issues \u201cheard no more\u201d (Indians, Prohibition, Hitler): The author calls these \u201camazing\u201d silences for a 1997 reader <invalid_quote>\u201cWhat is most amazing \u2026 is the silence\u201d</invalid_quote>, urging us to decode the political calculations behind the omissions.\n\n3. Argument 2: Inaugurals as \u201cleader-preacher\u201d metamorphosis requiring audience decoding  \n   a. The shift from \u201cclassic public servant\u201d to \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d is described as \u201cmetamorphosed\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cIn the third phase \u2026 metamorphosed\u201d</invalid_quote>. Metamorphosis implies change in code and style, not passive record.  \n   b. Change in sentence-length \u201cstatistic\u201d (44 \u2192 34 \u2192 25) is offered to illustrate evolving \u201cmeans of communication\u201d and \u201ccharacter of the audience\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThis statistic \u2026 reflects the change in \u2026 audience\u201d</invalid_quote>. We must interpret these form changes cryptically to understand evolving presidential strategies.\n\n4. Argument 3: Author\u2019s methodological recommendations  \n   a. \u201cAll are worth a read \u2026 They will give you a feeling of being there \u2026 limited by \u2026 information, concerns, and values of those times\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThey will give \u2026 being there\u201d</invalid_quote>. Feeling \u201climited\u201d implies active reconstruction and interpretation, not passive snapshot viewing.  \n   b. The author warns: \u201cReaders will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d <quote>We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now,</quote>. This forward-looking warning underscores that inaugurals are to be studied cryptically as texts whose full meaning only emerges in hindsight.\n\n5. Rebuttal of snapshot theory  \n   a. Debater_B\u2019s \u201csnapshot\u201d fails to account for the author\u2019s repeated focus on \u201csilences\u201d and \u201ctelltale signs\u201d (e.g., \u201cLet us \u2026\u201d usage) as intentional rhetorical devices. A snapshot is neutral; cryptic interpretation presupposes motive and coded messaging.  \n   b. A mere snapshot cannot explain why \u201cMany an issue frets its hour \u2026 and then is heard no more,\u201d nor why presidents mine predecessors for \u201cmemorable words \u2026 without attribution.\u201d These behaviors imply a coded dialogue across time requiring decryption, not static record-keeping.  \n   c. The author\u2019s interest in how audiences\u2019 knowledge (e.g., \u201cwould not have known what the Internet was\u201d) shapes style indicates inaugurals are designed with hidden assumptions, not just plain reportage of a moment.\n\nConclusion  \n   The author\u2019s thesis is that inaugural speeches are a layered, cryptic discourse: content, omissions, style, and intertextual references combine to form a historical puzzle. We must interpret these speeches to uncover underlying political motives, societal taboos, and evolving presidential strategies. The \u201csnapshot\u201d view is too superficial and ignores the textual silences the author highlights as central to understanding our past.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"They present a snapshot of the views and beliefs of their time\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Clarifying \u201ccryptic\u201d versus \u201csnapshot\u201d  \n   a. \u201cCryptic\u201d includes both explicit text and purposeful silences/omissions that must be decoded to grasp full intent. The author repeatedly highlights what is not said as revealing societal taboos and power plays. A mere snapshot ignores these silences.  \n   b. A \u201csnapshot\u201d implies passive observation; the author urges active reconstruction: <invalid_quote>\u201cThey will give you a feeling of being there\u2026limited by\u2026the information, the concerns, and the values of those times.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b61). Feeling \u201climited\u201d means you must infer missing data.  \n\n2. Argument 1: Silences as deliberate codes  \n   a. Race: \u201cThe words \u2018black,\u2019 \u2018blacks,\u2019 \u2018Negro,\u2019 or \u2018race\u2019\u2026do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes\u201d (\u00b614). This 88-year silence is a cipher pointing to political denial. The author calls it \u201camazing\u201d for a 1997 reader, demanding interpretation: \u201cWhat is most amazing\u2026is the silence\u201d (\u00b612).  \n   b. Women: \u201cThe word \u2018women\u2019 does not appear at all until Wilson\u2026never\u2026any special concerns of women\u201d (\u00b612). Such systematic omission is not mere oversight\u2014it encodes the prevailing refusal to acknowledge half the populace.  \n   c. Issues \u201cheard no more\u201d (Indians, Prohibition, Hitler): These recurring topics vanish once politically expedient, then re-emerge or remain hidden. The author\u2019s fascination with these patterns shows inaugurals are puzzles: why vanish? When return?  \n\n3. Argument 2: Stylistic metamorphosis as shifting codes  \n   a. Three phases: modest servant \u2192 prosaic executive \u2192 \u201cassertive, theatrical leader-preacher\u201d (\u00b65\u20136). \u201cMetamorphosed\u201d implies a change in rhetorical code. You must interpret new symbols (e.g., \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d usage) as directives, not mere decoration.  \n   b. Sentence-length shift (44\u219234\u219225 words/sentence) reflects not only audience literacy but the president\u2019s strategic choice of code suited to mass persuasion via radio/TV <quote>it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication.</quote> (\u00b610). We decode these forms to understand evolving persuasive strategies.  \n\n4. Argument 3: Intertextual references require decryption  \n   a. Presidents \u201cmine predecessors for memorable words\u2026without attribution\u201d (\u00b611). Kennedy\u2019s \u201cAsk not\u2026\u201d echoes Harding\u2019s phrasing. This uncredited borrowing is a coded dialogue across eras; understanding influence and motive demands cryptic analysis.  \n   b. Hidden assumptions: Harrison\u2019s references to Athens, Rome presume audience classical education. Modern speeches omit such allusions, signaling new cultural codes. Recognizing these tacit codes is essential to interpret intended meaning and audience.  \n\n5. Methodological prescription for cryptic reading  \n   a. Author: \u201cAll are worth a read \u2026 not as an omniscient historian\u2026 but as an ordinary citizen\u2026limited by\u2026information\u201d (\u00b61). He advocates experiencing constraints to decode context-specific allusions.  \n   b. Forward warning: \u201cWe should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today\u201d (\u00b616). This anticipates future scholars decrypting our omissions and assumptions.  \n\n6. Rebuttal of \u201csnapshot\u201d theory  \n   a. Debater_B\u2019s literal reading ignores the author\u2019s fascination with topic vanishings (\u201cmany an issue frets its hour\u2026and then is heard no more,\u201d \u00b611) and reappearances; these patterns only make sense as codes responding to shifting political climates.  \n   b. The author does more than catalog what is said; he searches for motives behind style changes and silences. A snapshot cannot explain deliberate humility pre\u2013Civil War to all-out assertion (\u00b65\u20136): such flips signal the president\u2019s coded stance on federal power.  \n   c. Debater_B claims \u201cplain-text moral failures\u201d suffice, but the author\u2019s lament of \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d (\u00b616) arises from plain text only after decoding omissions (slavery, race) over decades. Understanding this moral obtuseness itself requires cryptic reading of both word and silence.  \n\nConclusion  \n   The author treats inaugurals as interwoven texts of speech and silence, style and omission, intertextual borrowing, and medium-driven codes. He prescribes active decoding across time, not passive snapshot-taking. Only the \u201ccryptic interpretation\u201d thesis accounts for his emphasis on silences, metamorphoses, and future decryption.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cSnapshot of Their Time\u201d\n\n1. Author\u2019s Explicit Purpose  \n   a. The author directs readers to \u201cfeel[ ]\u2026limited by\u2026the concerns, and the values of those times\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cThey will give you a feeling of being there\u2026limited by\u2026the concerns, and the values of those times.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b61). Feeling \u201climited\u201d implies seeing inaugurals as authentic expressions of contemporary thought, not hidden puzzles awaiting decryption.  \n   b. The invitation to read \u201cnot just the highlights\u201d (\u00b61) signals a comprehensive survey, not selective code\u2010breaking.\n\n2. Treatment of Omissions as Evidence of Public Mindsets, Not Secret Codes  \n   a. Women silence until Wilson (\u00b612) is presented as \u201cmost amazing\u2026silence\u201d (\u00b612) to highlight past ignorance, not to suggest a hidden meaning. The author laments \u201cignorance and moral obtuseness\u201d revealed by plain text <quote> We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said a</quote> (\u00b616). If speeches were cryptic, ignorance would be hidden, not displayed so openly.  \n   b. Race omissions before Hayes and weak \u201cabstract\u201d post\u2013WWII mentions (\u00b614\u201315) are cited to chart evolving public acceptance, not to propose secret agendas. The author praises explicit postwar efforts and criticizes previous failures, indicating reliance on clear statements.\n\n3. Style and Statistics Reflect Audience Adaptation  \n   a. Sentence\u2010length averages (44\u219234\u219225 words) (\u00b610) are analyzed quantitatively \u201cto reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication.\u201d The author sees shorter sentences as adaptation, not as coded linguistic shifts needing decryption.  \n   b. The rise of \u201cLet us\u2026\u201d appeals (\u00b69) and references to \u201cbully pulpit\u201d (\u00b69) show direct exhortations of citizens. The author describes these as \u201cdiagnoses and prescriptions\u201d (\u00b68), emphasizing straightforward exhortation over encoded messaging.\n\n4. Intertextual Reuse as Influence, Not Cryptic Dialogue  \n   a. Presidents\u2019 borrowing phrases (Harding \u2192 Kennedy) (\u00b611) is discussed neutrally as \u201cmined\u2026without attribution,\u201d not as secret signals. The author\u2019s irony at Harding\u2019s own words becoming Kennedy\u2019s rallying cry points to historical continuity in rhetoric, not hidden codes across time.  \n   b. Issues \u201cheard no more\u201d (\u00b613) are catalogued to illustrate shifting public priorities, not puzzles. The author notes Prohibition, Hitler, coastal defenses as \u201cheard no more\u201d to demonstrate that inaugurals reflect immediate concerns, not concealed motives.\n\nRebuttal of Cryptic\u2010History Thesis\n\n1. Misreads Plain\u2010Language Lamentations  \n   a. Debater_A claims omissions are \u201cpuzzles,\u201d but the author treats them as moral failings to \u201cshake their heads\u201d at (\u00b616). A puzzle invites solutions; a wrong view invites correction.  \n   b. The author\u2019s \u201cforward-looking warning\u201d (\u00b616) encourages humility about today\u2019s beliefs. If inaugurals were cryptic, future readers could not plainly \u201cshake their heads.\u201d\n\n2. Overstates \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d as Evidence of Code  \n   a. \u201cMetamorphosed from describing\u2026to inspiring\u201d (\u00b68) describes functional evolution: from policy statements to public inspiration, driven by technological advances (radio, TV) and audience scope. This is adaptation, not secret messaging.  \n   b. Debater_A\u2019s appeal to \u201cmetamorphosis\u201d ignores the author\u2019s explicit context of \u201cbully pulpit\u201d (\u00b69) causing presidents to adopt direct speech and colloquial style for broader reach.\n\n3. Quantitative Evidence Contradicts Cryptic Interpretation  \n   a. Sentence\u2010length statistics are objective measures. A cryptic method would focus on nuanced word\u2010play or hidden meanings, not average word counts.  \n   b. The author\u2019s acceptance of shorter sentences as non\u2010deterioration (\u00b610) implies trust in plain\u2010spoken communication.\n\nConclusion  \nThe author treats inaugural addresses as unvarnished artifacts reflecting the fears, values, and priorities of their eras. He relies on direct quotations, explicit references, and quantitative style measures to trace straightforward evolution. Omissions are moral blind spots, not cryptic signals. Intertextual echoes demonstrate influence, not coded dialogue. Therefore, the inaugurals are best understood as snapshots of their time, not cryptic puzzles.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
