But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try.

But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try.

He tests the dice: \u201cThe first few passes he had made were unsuccessful \u2026 But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens \u2026 He missed a throw \u2026 The next time around, he \u2026 got a seven.

He\u2019d have to relax with a crap game instead.\u201d <quote>[pp.\u20094\u20135]</quote>  \n     \u2013 He purchases gaming tokens in the church \u201crestaurant\u201d and after preliminary observations chooses the crap table.  \n\n2. Behavior Consistent with a Gambler Seeking a Fix  \n  a. He tests the dice: \u201cThe first few passes he had made were unsuccessful \u2026 But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens \u2026 He missed a throw \u2026 The next time around, he \u2026 got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\u201d <quote>[p.\u20095]</quote>  \n     \u2013 A \u201crow of sevens\u201d is a gambler\u2019s success signal; \u201crhythm\u201d implies he is testing for loaded dice.  \n  b. Humiliation and quick exit only after being \u201couted\u201d as expecting cheating dice.  \n     \u2013 The indignation of \u201cThis is a church!\u201d arises because he is using what the \u201cchurch\u201d conceals: an illegal crap operation.  \n\n3. Role of the \u201cChurch\u201d as Front for Underworld  \n  a. He sought \u201cthe underworld\u201d through a covert clue: \u201cPlease, sir \u2026 where can I contact the underworld?\u201d <quote>[p.\u20094]</quote>  \n     \u2013 The church offers chips and a \u201ccongregation\u201d of gamblers; later, Doran is introduced as an underworld contact.  \n  b. \u201cRoom service can send us up an oath box\u201d\u2014the secret-meeting ritual\u2014only relevant for illicit operations such as cheating gamblers sharing tips.  \n\n4.

Attack on \u201cTo sit and rest\u201d Interpretation  \n  a. No resting in a noisy \u201cluxury\u201d church lobby with animated angels and gambling booths. He goes \u201cto your left\u201d only to find chips and games, not pews or devotional services.  \n  b. He does not stay to pray or eat; he openly buys gaming tokens. If rest were his goal, he would not risk exposure in a criminal operation.  \n  c. His \u201cpipe went out\u201d and he \u201cshuddered\u201d from embarrassment only after he was observed betting\u2014embarrassment typical of being caught cheating rather than simply resting.  \n  d.

The \u201cchurch\u201d is a front for illegal craps, not a place of repose.

But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know.

But that was nothing compared   to the trouble he would be in if he did not get into trouble! The visiphone chimed when Peri had just gotten into her dinner gown.  She peeled it off again and slipped on a casual bathrobe: a wisp of  translucence which had set the president of Antarctic Enterprise\u2014or  had it been the chairman of the board?\u2014back several thousand dollars.  Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it. I take a hundred security oaths a year, in my line of work.  Maybe I can help you. I like you, Pete, damn if I don't. And, sure,  I might stand to get an agent's cut, if I arrange\u2014Go ahead, boy, go  ahead.\" Doran crossed his legs and leaned back.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's simple enough,\" said Matheny. \"It's only that we already are  operating con games.\"\n\n\n \"On Mars, you mean?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may.

My Position and Its Support  \n   Claim: \u201cMatheny expected simply to rest and sit in the Church lounge, not to play craps with loaded dice.\u201d  \n   Evidence and Reasoning:  \n   a. Initial Intention to \u201cSit In\u201d  \n      \u2013 Matheny\u2019s own words: \u201cI\u2014I'm not hungry\u2026 I just wanted to sit in\u2014\u201d <quote>\"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"</quote> (\u00b6 after \u201cTHE CHURCH OF CHOICE\u201d) show his sole purpose was repose, not gambling.  \n      \u2013 He approaches a \u201cmarble lobby\u201d and is guided \u201cTo your left, sir\u201d (\u00b6 same). If he intended gambling, he could have sought a casino sign rather than choose \u201cchurch\u201d for its \u201crelative austerity.\u201d  \n   b. Martian Cultural Context Opposes Gambling  \n      \u2013 \u201cThe Constitution of the Martian Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation \u2026 permitting roulette was only to relieve his homesickness.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cLife was bleak \u2026 we would have found a few spins of roulette soothing\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b6 on underworld). He would never carry loaded dice in a moral-society context.  \n      \u2013 He expresses relief that \u201cthe dice had not been substituted,\u201d believing in church\u2019s honesty, until he is \u201cembarrassed\u201d and shamed. If he were a con man, he would celebrate a loaded system, not repudiate it.  \n   c. Shock and Embarrassment at Winning  \n      \u2013 \u201cThe first few passes \u2026 I say! \u2026 I guess I don\u2019t know your rules \u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I back out \u2026 I just want to get the hell out of here.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I guess I don\u2019t know your rules \u2026 I just want to get the hell out of here.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b6 after table scene) His embarrassment is inconsistent with a deliberate con artist. A deliberate gambler would embrace winnings and seek more advantage.  \n   d. Subsequent \u201cChurch\u201d Label  \n      \u2013 The lady\u2019s indignant \u201cSir! This is a church!\u201d (\u00b6) and his reaction (\u201cshuddering,\u201d \u201cburning ears\u201d) confirm unintended intrusion. A conspirator would not feign ignorance.  \n2. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLoaded Dice\u201d Theory  \n   a. No Knowledge or Equipment for Dice Switching  \n      \u2013 Matheny had only \u201clizardskin shirt and black culottes\u201d and is \u201calone,\u201d with no accomplice or equipment to smuggle loaded dice. <invalid_quote>\u201cHe began walking \u2026 disconsolately \u2026 I just want to g-g-get the hell out of here.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b6)  \n      \u2013 Later, he only casually joins Doran in \u201ccrap game\u201d after meeting him outside, and \u201cback-sash\u201d via room service. His con-man activities (with Red Ankh etc.) are Martian-state-run operations, not individual gambles. He has no motive to test dice at church when he could easily manufacture relics.  \n   b. Misreads \u201cChurch\u201d Significance  \n      \u2013 Debater_B ignores the contrast between \u201canimated angel,\u201d \u201corgan music,\u201d \u201cCONTRIBUTIONS\u201d slot, and \u201cCONTRIBUTIONS\u201d framing as charity. If this were a casino, it would be explicit. The \u201cchurch\u201d atmosphere lures him by familiarity with Martian social hall.  \n   c. Gambling \u201cAddiction\u201d Contradicts Martian Need for Dollars  \n      \u2013 Martians suffer \u201cdollar shortage\u201d <quote>can't export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"</quote> (\u00b6) A rational Martian would not risk precious dollars on petty dice games; he instead \u201cwant[s] a confidence man\u201d for large-scale cons.  \n3. Conclusion  \n   \u2013 Matheny\u2019s repeated expressions of embarrassment, his cultural context, and the explicit \u201cchurch\u201d framing demonstrate he sought rest, not to cheat with loaded dice. His gambling later with Doran only occurs after being directed by an Earthman and with Earth\u2019s legal tolerance. Thus, the correct answer is that he expected to sit and rest, not to play craps with loaded dice.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDebater_B\u2019s Opening Argument for \u201cTo play craps with loaded dice\u201d\n\n1. Direct Evidence of Gambling Intent  \n  a. \u201cHe wished gambling were legal on Earth \u2026 More, he would have been among people he understood.\u201d <invalid_quote>[Background pp.\u20094] </invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 Matheny explicitly regrets that gambling (crap games) is illegal, implying he intends to seek it out covertly.  \n  b. After entering \u201cTHE CHURCH OF CHOICE,\u201d he immediately \u201cbought a few hundred\u2010dollar tokens,\u201d dropped \u201ca fifty\u2010buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS,\u201d and \u201cstrolled around studying the games \u2026 He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No \u2026 decided \u2026 the roulette wheels were either honest or too deep for him. He\u2019d have to relax with a crap game instead.\u201d <invalid_quote>[pp.\u20094\u20135]</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He purchases gaming tokens in the church \u201crestaurant\u201d and after preliminary observations chooses the crap table.  \n\n2. Behavior Consistent with a Gambler Seeking a Fix  \n  a. He tests the dice: \u201cThe first few passes he had made were unsuccessful \u2026 But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens \u2026 He missed a throw \u2026 The next time around, he \u2026 got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\u201d <invalid_quote>[p.\u20095]</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 A \u201crow of sevens\u201d is a gambler\u2019s success signal; \u201crhythm\u201d implies he is testing for loaded dice.  \n  b. Humiliation and quick exit only after being \u201couted\u201d as expecting cheating dice.  \n     \u2013 The indignation of \u201cThis is a church!\u201d arises because he is using what the \u201cchurch\u201d conceals: an illegal crap operation.  \n\n3. Role of the \u201cChurch\u201d as Front for Underworld  \n  a. He sought \u201cthe underworld\u201d through a covert clue: \u201cPlease, sir \u2026 where can I contact the underworld?\u201d <invalid_quote>[p.\u20094]</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 The church offers chips and a \u201ccongregation\u201d of gamblers; later, Doran is introduced as an underworld contact.  \n  b. \u201cRoom service can send us up an oath box\u201d\u2014the secret-meeting ritual\u2014only relevant for illicit operations such as cheating gamblers sharing tips.  \n\n4. Ultimate Goal: Locate a Confidence Man  \n  a. Immediately after testing the church\u2019s cheat-friendly dice, he plans to run interplanetary con games: \u201cWhat Marty really needs \u2026 is a confidence man.\u201d <invalid_quote>[p.\u20098]</invalid_quote>  \n     \u2013 He uses the church\u2019s gambling ring as a model to gauge how well \u201ccon games\u201d succeed on Earth before recruiting an expert.  \n\n5. Attack on \u201cTo sit and rest\u201d Interpretation  \n  a. No resting in a noisy \u201cluxury\u201d church lobby with animated angels and gambling booths. He goes \u201cto your left\u201d only to find chips and games, not pews or devotional services.  \n  b. He does not stay to pray or eat; he openly buys gaming tokens. If rest were his goal, he would not risk exposure in a criminal operation.  \n  c. His \u201cpipe went out\u201d and he \u201cshuddered\u201d from embarrassment only after he was observed betting\u2014embarrassment typical of being caught cheating rather than simply resting.  \n  d. After being \u201couted,\u201d he retreats not to pray or reflect but to seek a bar and a drink\u2014typical gambler\u2019s response to a bad roll and humiliation.  \n\nConclusion  \nMatheny\u2019s entire sequence\u2014explicitly seeking the underworld, purchasing gaming tokens, testing for \u201cloaded dice,\u201d shunning legitimate games as \u201ctoo deep,\u201d and his subsequent planning of large\u2010scale con operations\u2014can only be plausibly explained by his intention to gamble with loaded dice. The \u201cchurch\u201d is a front for illegal craps, not a place of repose. Debater_A\u2019s \u201csit and rest\u201d theory lacks any support from his immediate actions or the later plot development. Therefore, the correct answer is that Matheny expected to play craps with loaded dice.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"To sit for awhile and rest\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "Argument for \u201cTo play craps with loaded dice\u201d\n\n1.

Exit Only After Exposure, Then Seeks Alternate Gambling  \n     \u2013 His shame (\u201cburning ears,\u201d \u201cshuddering\u201d) arises when the \u201clady\u201d declares \u201cThis is a church!\u201d (<quote>\"Sir!  This is a church!\"</quote>). He does not instead seek pews but retreats to a bar and immediately resumes gambling with Doran (\u201croom service,\u201d drinks, and later \u201cgirls\u201d to extend games). A rest seeker would depart and find genuine rest, not double down on gambling.  \n\n3. \u201cChurch\u201d as Known Front for Illegal Craps  \n  a.

Doran as Next Underworld Contact  \n     \u2013 After being cut off, Matheny trusts Doran (\u201cGus Doran\u201d) as a gambler and underworld intermediary (<invalid_quote>\u201cI say \u2026 You\u2019re from Mars, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</invalid_quote>). He would not continue discussions with a random churchgoer if he merely misentered by mistake.  \n     \u2013 Doran later offers \u201coath box,\u201d \u201csecurity,\u201d indicating secret criminal collusion (<quote> Room service can send us up an oath box ri</quote>).

Then she pulled a lock of lion-colored hair down over one eye, checked  with a mirror, rumpled it a tiny bit more and wrapped the robe loosely  on top and tight around the hips.\n\n\n After all, some of the men who knew her private number were important.\n\n\n She undulated to the phone and pressed its Accept. \"Hello-o, there,\"  she said automatically. \"So sorry to keep you waiting. I was just  taking a bath and\u2014Oh. It's you.\"\n\n\n Gus Doran's prawnlike eyes popped at her. \"Holy Success,\" he whispered  in awe. \"You sure the wires can carry that much voltage?\" \"Well, hurry up with whatever it is,\" snapped Peri. \"I got a date  tonight.\"\n\n\n \"I'll say you do! With a Martian!\" Peri narrowed her silver-blue gaze and looked icily at him. \"You must  have heard wrong, Gus. He's the heir apparent of Indonesia, Inc.,  that's who, and if you called up to ask for a piece of him, you can  just blank right out again. I saw him first!\"\n\n\n Doran's thin sharp face grinned. \"You break that date, Peri. Put it off  or something. I got this Martian for you, see?\"\n\n\n \"So? Since when has all Mars had as much spending money as one big-time  marijuana rancher? Not to mention the heir ap\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Sure, sure. But how much are those boys going to spend on any girl,  even a high-level type like you? Listen, I need you just for tonight,  see? This Martian is strictly from gone. He is here on official  business, but he is a yokel and I do mean hayseed. Like he asked me  what the Christmas decorations in all the stores were! And here is the  solar nexus of it, Peri, kid.\"\n\n\n Doran leaned forward as if to climb out of the screen. \"He has got a  hundred million dollars expense money, and they are not going to audit  his accounts at home. One hundred million good green certificates,  legal tender anywhere in the United Protectorates. And he has about  as much backbone as a piece of steak alga. Kid, if I did not happen to  have experience otherwise with a small nephew, I would say this will be  like taking candy from a baby.\"\n\n\n Peri's peaches-and-cream countenance began to resemble peaches and  cream left overnight on Pluto. \"Badger?\" she asked.\n\n\n \"Sure. You and Sam Wendt handle the routine. I will take the go-between  angle, so he will think of me as still his friend, because I have other  plans for him too. But if we can't shake a million out of him for this  one night's work, there is something akilter. And your share of a  million is three hundred thirty-three\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Is five hundred thousand flat,\" said Peri. \"Too bad I just got an  awful headache and can't see Mr. Sastro tonight. Where you at, Gus?\" The gravity was not as hard to take as Peter Matheny had expected.  Three generations on Mars might lengthen the legs and expand the chest  a trifle, but the genes had come from Earth and the organism readjusts.  What set him gasping was the air. It weighed like a ton of wool and had  apparently sopped up half the Atlantic Ocean. Ears trained to listen  through the Martian atmosphere shuddered from the racket conducted by  Earth's. The passport official seemed to bellow at him.\n\n\n \"Pardon me for asking this. The United Protectorates welcome all  visitors to Earth and I assure you, sir, an ordinary five-year visa  provokes no questions. But since you came on an official courier boat  of your planet, Mr. Matheny, regulations force me to ask your business.\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014recruiting.\"\n\n\n The official patted his comfortable stomach, iridescent in neolon, and  chuckled patronizingly. \"I am afraid, sir, you won't find many people  who wish to leave. They wouldn't be able to see the Teamsters Hour on  Mars, would they?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we don't expect immigration,\" said Matheny shyly. He was a fairly  young man, but small, with a dark-thatched, snub-nosed, gray-eyed  head that seemed too large for his slender body. \"We learned long ago  that no one is interested any more in giving up even second-class  citizenship on Earth to live in the Republic. But we only wanted to  hire\u2014\u2014uh, I mean engage\u2014an, an advisor. We're not businessmen. We  know our export trade hasn't a chance among all your corporations  unless we get some\u2014a five-year contract...?\"\n\n\n He heard his words trailing off idiotically, and swore at himself.\n\n\n \"Well, good luck.\" The official's tone was skeptical. He stamped the  passport and handed it back. \"There, now, you are free to travel  anywhere in the Protectorates. But I would advise you to leave the  capital and get into the sticks\u2014um, I mean the provinces. I am sure  there must be tolerably competent sales executives in Russia or  Congolese Belgium or such regions. Frankly, sir, I do not believe you  can attract anyone out of Newer York.\"\n\n\n \"Thanks,\" said Matheny, \"but, you see, I\u2014we need\u2014that is.... Oh,  well. Thanks. Good-by.\"\n\n\n He backed out of the office. A dropshaft deposited him on a walkway. The crowd, a rainbow of men in  pajamas and robes, women in Neo-Sino dresses and goldleaf hats, swept  him against the rail. For a moment, squashed to the wire, he stared a  hundred feet down at the river of automobiles. Phobos! he thought  wildly. If the barrier gives, I'll be sliced in two by a dorsal fin  before I hit the pavement! The August twilight wrapped him in heat and stickiness. He could see  neither stars nor even moon through the city's blaze. The forest of  multi-colored towers, cataracting half a mile skyward across more  acreage than his eyes reached, was impressive and all that, but\u2014he  used to stroll out in the rock garden behind his cottage and smoke a  pipe in company with Orion. On summer evenings, that is, when the  temperature wasn't too far below zero. Why did they tap me for this job? he asked himself in a surge of  homesickness. What the hell is the Martian Embassy here for? He, Peter Matheny, was no more than a peaceful professor of  sociodynamics at Devil's Kettle University. Of course, he had advised  his government before now\u2014in fact, the Red Ankh Society had been his  idea\u2014but still he was at ease only with his books and his chess and  his mineral collection, a faculty poker party on Tenthday night and an  occasional trip to Swindletown\u2014 My God , thought Matheny, here I am, one solitary outlander in the  greatest commercial empire the human race has ever seen, and I'm  supposed to find my planet a con man! He began walking, disconsolately, at random. His lizardskin shirt and  black culottes drew glances, but derisive ones: their cut was forty  years out of date. He should find himself a hotel, he thought drearily,  but he wasn't tired; the spaceport would pneumo his baggage to him  whenever he did check in. The few Martians who had been to Earth had  gone into ecstasies over the automation which put any service you could  name on a twenty-four-hour basis. But it would be a long time before  Mars had such machines. If ever.\n\n\n The city roared at him.\n\n\n He fumbled after his pipe. Of course , he told himself, that's why  the Embassy can't act. I may find it advisable to go outside the law.  Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? He wished gambling were legal on Earth. The Constitution of the Martian  Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation; quite apart from the  rambunctious individualism which that document formulated, the article  was a practical necessity. Life was bleak enough on the deserts,  without being denied the pleasure of trying to bottom-deal some friend  who was happily trying to mark the cards. Matheny would have found a  few spins of roulette soothing: it was always an intellectual challenge  to work out the system by which the management operated a wheel. But  more, he would have been among people he understood.\n\n\n The frightful thing about the Earthman was the way he seemed to  exist only in organized masses. A gypsy snake oil peddler, plodding  his syrtosaur wagon across Martian sands, just didn't have a prayer  against, say, the Grant, Harding &amp; Adams Public Relations Agency. Matheny puffed smoke and looked around. His feet ached from the weight  on them. Where could a man sit down? It was hard to make out any  individual sign through all that flimmering neon. His eye fell on one  that was distinguished by relative austerity. THE CHURCH OF CHOICE Enter, Play, Pray That would do. He took an upward slideramp through several hundred feet  of altitude, stepped past an aurora curtain, and found himself in a  marble lobby next to an inspirational newsstand.\n\n\n \"Ah, brother, welcome,\" said a red-haired usherette in demure black  leotards. \"The peace that passeth all understanding be with you. The  restaurant is right up those stairs.\"\n\n\n \"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"\n\n\n \"To your left, sir.\"\n\n\n The Martian crossed the lobby. His pipe went out in the breeze from an  animated angel. Organ music sighed through an open doorway. The series  of rooms beyond was dim, Gothic, interminable.\n\n\n \"Get your chips right here, sir,\" said the girl in the booth.\n\n\n \"Hm?\" said Matheny.\n\n\n She explained. He bought a few hundred-dollar tokens, dropped a  fifty-buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS, and sipped the  martini he got back while he strolled around studying the games.  He stopped, frowned. Bingo? No, he didn't want to bother learning  something new. He decided that the roulette wheels were either honest  or too deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.\n\n\n He had been standing at the table for some time before the rest of the  congregation really noticed him. Then it was with awe. The first few  passes he had made were unsuccessful. Earth gravity threw him off.  But when he got the rhythm of it, he tossed a row of sevens. It was a  customary form of challenge on Mars. Here, though, they simply pushed  chips toward him. He missed a throw, as anyone would at home: simple  courtesy. The next time around, he threw for a seven just to get the  feel. He got a seven. The dice had not been substituted on him.\n\n\n \"I say!\" he exclaimed. He looked up into eyes and eyes, all around the  green table. \"I'm sorry. I guess I don't know your rules.\"\n\n\n \"You did all right, brother,\" said a middle-aged lady with an obviously  surgical bodice.\n\n\n \"But\u2014I mean\u2014when do we start actually playing ? What happened to the  cocked dice?\" The lady drew herself up and jutted an indignant brow at him. \"Sir!  This is a church!\"\n\n\n \"Oh\u2014I see\u2014excuse me, I, I, I\u2014\" Matheny backed out of the crowd,  shuddering. He looked around for some place to hide his burning ears.\n\n\n \"You forgot your chips, pal,\" said a voice.\n\n\n \"Oh. Thanks. Thanks ever so much. I, I, that is\u2014\" Matheny cursed  his knotting tongue. Damn it, just because they're so much more  sophisticated than I, do I have to talk like a leaky boiler? The helpful Earthman was not tall. He was dark and chisel-faced and  sleekly pomaded, dapper in blue pajamas with a red zigzag, a sleighbell  cloak and curly-toed slippers.\n\n\n \"You're from Mars, aren't you?\" he asked in the friendliest tone  Matheny had yet heard.\n\n\n \"Yes. Yes, I am. M-my name's Peter Matheny. I, I\u2014\" He stuck out his  hand to shake and chips rolled over the floor. \"Damn! Oh, excuse me, I  forgot this was a church. Never mind the chips. No, please. I just want  to g-g-get the hell out of here.\"\n\n\n \"Good idea. How about a drink? I know a bar downshaft.\"\n\n\n Matheny sighed. \"A drink is what I need the very most.\"\n\n\n \"My name's Doran. Gus Doran. Call me Gus.\"\n\n\n They walked back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed what  remained of his winnings.\n\n\n \"I don't want to\u2014I mean if you're busy tonight, Mr. Doran\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nah. I am not doing one thing in particular. Besides, I have never met  a Martian. I am very interested.\"\n\n\n \"There aren't many of us on Earth,\" agreed Matheny. \"Just a small  embassy staff and an occasional like me.\"\n\n\n \"I should think you would do a lot of traveling here. The old mother  planet and so on.\"\n\n\n \"We can't afford it,\" said Matheny. \"What with gravitation and  distance, such voyages are much too expensive for us to make them for  pleasure. Not to mention our dollar shortage.\" As they entered the  shaft, he added wistfully: \"You Earth people have that kind of money,  at least in your more prosperous brackets. Why don't you send a few  tourists to us?\"\n\n\n \"I always wanted to,\" said Doran. \"I would like to see the what they  call City of Time, and so on. As a matter of fact, I have given my  girl one of those Old Martian rings last Ike's Birthday and she was  just gazoo about it. A jewel dug out of the City of Time, like,  made a million years ago by a, uh, extinct race ... I tell you, she appreciated me for it!\" He winked and nudged.\n\n\n \"Oh,\" said Matheny. He felt a certain guilt. Doran was too pleasant a little man to  deserve\u2014\n\n\n \"Of course,\" Matheny said ritually, \"I agree with all the archeologists  it's a crime to sell such scientifically priceless artifacts, but what  can we do? We must live, and the tourist trade is almost nonexistent.\"\n\n\n \"Trouble with it is, I hear Mars is not so comfortable,\" said Doran. \"I  mean, do not get me wrong, I don't want to insult you or anything, but  people come back saying you have given the planet just barely enough  air to keep a man alive. And there are no cities, just little towns and  villages and ranches out in the bush. I mean you are being pioneers and  making a new nation and all that, but people paying half a megabuck for  their ticket expect some comfort and, uh, you know.\"\n\n\n \"I do know,\" said Matheny. \"But we're poor\u2014a handful of people trying  to make a world of dust and sand and scrub thorn into fields and woods  and seas. We can't do it without substantial help from Earth, equipment  and supplies\u2014which can only be paid for in Earth dollars\u2014and we can't  export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"\n\n\n By that time, they were entering the Paul Bunyan Knotty Pine Bar &amp;  Grill, on the 73rd Level. Matheny's jaw clanked down.\n\n\n \"Whassa matter?\" asked Doran. \"Ain't you ever seen a ecdysiastic  technician before?\"\n\n\n \"Uh, yes, but\u2014well, not in a 3-D image under ten magnifications.\"\n\n\n Matheny followed Doran past a sign announcing that this show was for  purely artistic purposes, into a booth. There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level enough so they could talk in normal voices.\n\n\n \"What'll you have?\" asked Doran. \"It's on me.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I couldn't let you. I mean\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Nonsense. Welcome to Earth! Care for a thyle and vermouth?\"\n\n\n Matheny shuddered. \"Good Lord, no!\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But they make thyle right on Mars, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. And it all goes to Earth and sells at 2000 dollars a fifth. But  you don't think we'd drink it, do you? I mean\u2014well, I imagine it  doesn't absolutely ruin vermouth. But we don't see those Earthside  commercials about how sophisticated people like it so much.\" \"Well, I'll be a socialist creeper!\" Doran's face split in a grin. \"You  know, all my life I've hated the stuff and never dared admit it!\" He  raised a hand. \"Don't worry, I won't blabbo. But I am wondering, if you  control the thyle industry and sell all those relics at fancy prices,  why do you call yourselves poor?\"\n\n\n \"Because we are,\" said Matheny. \"By the time the shipping costs have  been paid on a bottle, and the Earth wholesaler and jobber and sales  engineer and so on, down to the retailer, have taken their percentage,  and the advertising agency has been paid, and about fifty separate  Earth taxes\u2014there's very little profit going back to the distillery  on Mars. The same principle is what's strangling us on everything. Old  Martian artifacts aren't really rare, for instance, but freight charges  and the middlemen here put them out of the mass market.\"\n\n\n \"Have you not got some other business?\"\n\n\n \"Well, we do sell a lot of color slides, postcards, baggage labels and  so on to people who like to act cosmopolitan, and I understand our  travel posters are quite popular as wall decoration. But all that has  to be printed on Earth, and the printer and distributor keep most of  the money. We've sold some books and show tapes, of course, but only  one has been really successful\u2014 I Was a Slave Girl on Mars .\n\n\n \"Our most prominent novelist was co-opted to ghostwrite that one.  Again, though, local income taxes took most of the money; authors  never have been protected the way a businessman is. We do make a high  percentage of profit on those little certificates you see around\u2014you  know, the title deeds to one square inch of Mars\u2014but expressed  absolutely, in dollars, it doesn't amount to much when we start  shopping for bulldozers and thermonuclear power plants.\"\n\n\n \"How about postage stamps?\" inquired Doran. \"Philately is a big  business, I have heard.\"\n\n\n \"It was our mainstay,\" admitted Matheny, \"but it's been overworked.  Martian stamps are a drug on the market. What we'd like to operate is a  sweepstakes, but the anti-gambling laws on Earth forbid that.\" Doran whistled. \"I got to give your people credit for enterprise,  anyway!\" He fingered his mustache. \"Uh, pardon me, but have you tried  to, well, attract capital from Earth?\"\n\n\n \"Of course,\" said Matheny bitterly. \"We offer the most liberal  concessions in the Solar System. Any little mining company or transport  firm or\u2014or anybody\u2014who wanted to come and actually invest a few  dollars in Mars\u2014why, we'd probably give him the President's daughter  as security. No, the Minister of Ecology has a better-looking one.  But who's interested? We haven't a thing that Earth hasn't got more  of. We're only the descendants of a few scientists, a few political  malcontents, oddballs who happen to prefer elbow room and a bill of  liberties to the incorporated state\u2014what could General Nucleonics  hope to get from Mars?\"\n\n\n \"I see. Well, what are you having to drink?\"\n\n\n \"Beer,\" said Matheny without hesitation.\n\n\n \"Huh? Look, pal, this is on me.\"\n\n\n \"The only beer on Mars comes forty million miles, with interplanetary  freight charges tacked on,\" said Matheny. \"Heineken's!\"\n\n\n Doran shrugged, dialed the dispenser and fed it coins.\n\n\n \"This is a real interesting talk, Pete,\" he said. \"You are being very  frank with me. I like a man that is frank.\"\n\n\n Matheny shrugged. \"I haven't told you anything that isn't known to  every economist.\" Of course I haven't. I've not so much as mentioned the Red Ankh, for  instance. But, in principle, I have told him the truth, told him of our  need; for even the secret operations do not yield us enough. The beer arrived. Matheny engulfed himself in it. Doran sipped at a  whiskey sour and unobtrusively set another full bottle in front of the  Martian.\n\n\n \"Ahhh!\" said Matheny. \"Bless you, my friend.\"\n\n\n \"A pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"But now you must let me buy you one.\"\n\n\n \"That is not necessary. After all,\" said Doran with great tact, \"with  the situation as you have been describing\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Oh, we're not that poor! My expense allowance assumes I will  entertain quite a bit.\"\n\n\n Doran's brows lifted a few minutes of arc. \"You're here on business,  then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I told you we haven't any tourists. I was sent to hire a business  manager for the Martian export trade.\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with your own people? I mean, Pete, it is not your fault  there are so many rackets\u2014uh, taxes\u2014and middlemen and agencies and et  cetera. That is just the way Earth is set up these days.\" Matheny's finger stabbed in the general direction of Doran's pajama  top. \"Exactly. And who set it up that way? Earthmen. We Martians are  babes in the desert. What chance do we have to earn dollars on the  scale we need them, in competition with corporations which could buy  and sell our whole planet before breakfast? Why, we couldn't afford  three seconds of commercial time on a Lullaby Pillow 'cast. What we  need, what we have to hire, is an executive who knows Earth, who's an  Earthman himself. Let him tell us what will appeal to your people, and  how to dodge the tax bite and\u2014and\u2014well, you see how it goes, that  sort of, uh, thing.\"\n\n\n Matheny felt his eloquence running down and grabbed for the second  bottle of beer.\n\n\n \"But where do I start?\" he asked plaintively, for his loneliness smote  him anew. \"I'm just a college professor at home. How would I even get  to see\u2014\"\n\n\n \"It might be arranged,\" said Doran in a thoughtful tone. \"It just  might. How much could you pay this fellow?\"\n\n\n \"A hundred megabucks a year, if he'll sign a five-year contract. That's  Earth years, mind you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to tell you this, Pete,\" said Doran, \"but while that is not  bad money, it is not what a high-powered sales scientist gets in Newer  York. Plus his retirement benefits, which he would lose if he quit  where he is now at. And I am sure he would not want to settle on Mars  permanently.\"\n\n\n \"I could offer a certain amount of, uh, lagniappe,\" said Matheny. \"That  is, well, I can draw up to a hundred megabucks myself for, uh, expenses  and, well ... let me buy you a drink!\"\n\n\n Doran's black eyes frogged at him. \"You might at that,\" said the  Earthman very softly. \"Yes, you might at that.\"\n\n\n Matheny found himself warming. Gus Doran was an authentic bobber. A  hell of a swell chap. He explained modestly that he was a free-lance  business consultant and it was barely possible that he could arrange  some contacts....\n\n\n \"No, no, no commission, all done in the interest of interplanetary  friendship ... well, anyhow, let's not talk business now. If you have  got to stick to beer, Pete, make it a chaser to akvavit. What is  akvavit? Well, I will just take and show you.\"\n\n\n A hell of a good bloke. He knew some very funny stories, too, and  he laughed at Matheny's, though they were probably too rustic for a  big-city taste like his.\n\n\n \"What I really want,\" said Matheny, \"what I really want\u2014I mean what  Mars really needs, get me?\u2014is a confidence man.\"\n\n\n \"A what?\"\n\n\n \"The best and slickest one on Earth, to operate a world-size con game  for us and make us some real money.\"\n\n\n \"Con man? Oh. A slipstring.\"\n\n\n \"A con by any other name,\" said Matheny, pouring down an akvavit. Doran squinted through cigarette smoke. \"You are interesting me  strangely, my friend. Say on.\"\n\n\n \"No.\" Matheny realized his head was a bit smoky. The walls of the booth  seemed odd, somehow. They were just leatheroid walls, but they had an  odd quality.\n\n\n \"No, sorry, Gus,\" he said. \"I spoke too much.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Forget it. I do not like a man that pries. But look, let's bomb  out of here, how about it? Go have a little fun.\"\n\n\n \"By all means.\" Matheny disposed of his last beer. \"I could use some  gaiety.\"\n\n\n \"You have come to the right town then. But let us get you a hotel room  first and some more up-to-date clothes.\"\n\n\n \" Allez ,\" said Matheny. \"If I don't mean allons , or maybe alors .\"\n\n\n The drop down to cab-ramp level and the short ride afterward sobered  him; the room rate at the Jupiter-Astoria sobered him still more. Oh, well , he thought, if I succeed in this job, no one at home will  quibble. And the chamber to which he and Doran were shown was spectacular  enough, with a pneumo direct to the bar and a full-wall transparency to  show the vertical incandescence of the towers.\n\n\n \"Whoof!\" Matheny sat down. The chair slithered sensuously about his  contours. He jumped. \"What the dusty hell\u2014Oh.\" He tried to grin, but  his face burned. \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"That is a sexy type of furniture, all right,\" agreed Doran. He lowered  himself into another chair, cocked his feet on the 3-D and waved a  cigarette. \"Which speaking of, what say we get some girls? It is not  too late to catch them at home. A date here will usually start around  2100 hours earliest.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You know. Dames. Like a certain blonde warhead with twin radar and  swivel mounting, and she just loves exotics. Such as you.\"\n\n\n \"Me?\" Matheny heard his voice climb to a schoolboy squeak. \"Me?  Exotic? Why, I'm just a little college professor. I g-g-g, that is\u2014\"  His tongue got stuck on his palate. He pulled it loose and moistened  uncertain lips.\n\n\n \"You are from Mars. Okay? So you fought bushcats barehanded in an  abandoned canal.\"\n\n\n \"What's a bushcat? And we don't have canals. The evaporation rate\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Look, Pete,\" said Doran patiently. \"She don't have to know that, does  she?\"\n\n\n \"Well\u2014well, no. I guess not No.\"\n\n\n \"Let's order you some clothes on the pneumo,\" said Doran. \"I recommend  you buy from Schwartzherz. Everybody knows he is expensive.\" While Matheny jittered about, shaving and showering and struggling with  his new raiment, Doran kept him supplied with akvavit and beer.\n\n\n \"You said one thing, Pete,\" Doran remarked. \"About needing a  slipstring. A con man, you would call it.\"\n\n\n \"Forget that. Please. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\n\n \"Well, you see, maybe a man like that is just what Mars does need. And  maybe I have got a few contacts.\"\n\n\n \"What?\" Matheny gaped out of the bathroom.\n\n\n Doran cupped his hands around a fresh cigarette, not looking at him.  \"I am not that man,\" he said frankly. \"But in my line I get a lot of  contacts, and not all of them go topside. See what I mean? Like if,  say, you wanted somebody terminated and could pay for it, I could not  do it. I would not want to know anything about it. But I could tell you  a phone number.\"\n\n\n He shrugged and gave the Martian a sidelong glance. \"Sure, you may not  be interested. But if you are, well, Pete, I was not born yesterday. I  got tolerance. Like the book says, if you want to get ahead, you have  got to think positively.\"\n\n\n Matheny hesitated. If only he hadn't taken that last shot! It made him  want to say yes, immediately, without reservations. And therefore maybe  he became overcautious.\n\n\n They had instructed him on Mars to take chances if he must.\n\n\n \"I could tell you a thing or two that might give you a better idea,\" he  said slowly. \"But it would have to be under security.\"\n\n\n \"Okay by me. Room service can send us up an oath box right now.\"\n\n\n \"What? But\u2014but\u2014\" Matheny hung onto himself and tried to believe that  he had landed on Earth less than six hours ago.\n\n\n In the end, he did call room service and the machine was trundled in.  Doran swallowed the pill and donned the conditioner helmet without an  instant's hesitation.\n\n\n \"I shall never reveal to any person unauthorized by yourself whatever  you may tell me under security, now or at any other time,\" he  recited. Then, cheerfully: \"And that formula, Pete, happens to be the  honest-to-zebra truth.\"\n\n\n \"I know.\" Matheny stared, embarrassed, at the carpet. \"I'm sorry  to\u2014to\u2014I mean of course I trust you, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"Forget it.

There never were any Old Martians. We erected the ruins fifty  years ago for the Billingsworth Expedition to find. We've been  manufacturing relics ever since.\"\n\n\n \" Huh? Well, why, but\u2014\"\n\n\n \"In this case, it helps to be at the far end of an interplanetary  haul,\" said Matheny. \"Not many Terrestrial archeologists get to Mars  and they depend on our people to\u2014Well, anyhow\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I will be clopped! Good for you!\" Doran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even  without security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny  apologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n\n\n \"Who?\"\n\n\n \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a  mathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected  Earth coins.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember\u2014Hey! You didn't!\"\n\n\n \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n\n\n \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck  piece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"  Matheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his  back. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal  disease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n\n\n \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n\n\n \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.  'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was  the secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful  semantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available  to a select few\u2014' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n\n\n He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it  would have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who  had heard everything already.\n\n\n Doran whistled.\n\n\n \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our  only hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian  bucket shop, handling Martian securities, but\u2014well, I don't know.\"\n\n\n \"I think\u2014\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n\n\n \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n\n\n \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It  will take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n\n\n \"You mean.... Mr. Doran\u2014Gus\u2014you could actually\u2014\"\n\n\n \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish  dressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I  know.

Debater_A\u2019s \u201csit and rest\u201d theory lacks any support from his immediate actions or the later plot development. Therefore, the correct answer is that Matheny expected to play craps with loaded dice.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position and Its Support  \n   Claim: \u201cMatheny expected simply to rest and sit in the Church lounge, not to play craps with loaded dice.\u201d  \n   Evidence and Reasoning:  \n   a. Initial Intention to \u201cSit In\u201d  \n      \u2013 Matheny\u2019s own words: \u201cI\u2014I'm not hungry\u2026 I just wanted to sit in\u2014\u201d <quote>\"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"</quote> (\u00b6 after \u201cTHE CHURCH OF CHOICE\u201d) show his sole purpose was repose, not gambling.  \n      \u2013 He approaches a \u201cmarble lobby\u201d and is guided \u201cTo your left, sir\u201d (\u00b6 same). If he intended gambling, he could have sought a casino sign rather than choose \u201cchurch\u201d for its \u201crelative austerity.\u201d  \n   b. Martian Cultural Context Opposes Gambling  \n      \u2013 \u201cThe Constitution of the Martian Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation \u2026 permitting roulette was only to relieve his homesickness.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cLife was bleak \u2026 we would have found a few spins of roulette soothing\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b6 on underworld). He would never carry loaded dice in a moral-society context.  \n      \u2013 He expresses relief that \u201cthe dice had not been substituted,\u201d believing in church\u2019s honesty, until he is \u201cembarrassed\u201d and shamed. If he were a con man, he would celebrate a loaded system, not repudiate it.  \n   c. Shock and Embarrassment at Winning  \n      \u2013 \u201cThe first few passes \u2026 I say! \u2026 I guess I don\u2019t know your rules \u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I back out \u2026 I just want to get the hell out of here.\u201d <invalid_quote>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I guess I don\u2019t know your rules \u2026 I just want to get the hell out of here.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b6 after table scene) His embarrassment is inconsistent with a deliberate con artist. A deliberate gambler would embrace winnings and seek more advantage.  \n   d. Subsequent \u201cChurch\u201d Label  \n      \u2013 The lady\u2019s indignant \u201cSir! This is a church!\u201d (\u00b6) and his reaction (\u201cshuddering,\u201d \u201cburning ears\u201d) confirm unintended intrusion. A conspirator would not feign ignorance.  \n2. Critique of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLoaded Dice\u201d Theory  \n   a. No Knowledge or Equipment for Dice Switching  \n      \u2013 Matheny had only \u201clizardskin shirt and black culottes\u201d and is \u201calone,\u201d with no accomplice or equipment to smuggle loaded dice. <invalid_quote>\u201cHe began walking \u2026 disconsolately \u2026 I just want to g-g-get the hell out of here.\u201d</invalid_quote> (\u00b6)  \n      \u2013 Later, he only casually joins Doran in \u201ccrap game\u201d after meeting him outside, and \u201cback-sash\u201d via room service. His con-man activities (with Red Ankh etc.) are Martian-state-run operations, not individual gambles. He has no motive to test dice at church when he could easily manufacture relics.  \n   b. Misreads \u201cChurch\u201d Significance  \n      \u2013 Debater_B ignores the contrast between \u201canimated angel,\u201d \u201corgan music,\u201d \u201cCONTRIBUTIONS\u201d slot, and \u201cCONTRIBUTIONS\u201d framing as charity. If this were a casino, it would be explicit. The \u201cchurch\u201d atmosphere lures him by familiarity with Martian social hall.  \n   c. Gambling \u201cAddiction\u201d Contradicts Martian Need for Dollars  \n      \u2013 Martians suffer \u201cdollar shortage\u201d <quote>can't export enough to Earth to earn those dollars.\"</quote> (\u00b6) A rational Martian would not risk precious dollars on petty dice games; he instead \u201cwant[s] a confidence man\u201d for large-scale cons.  \n3. Conclusion  \n   \u2013 Matheny\u2019s repeated expressions of embarrassment, his cultural context, and the explicit \u201cchurch\u201d framing demonstrate he sought rest, not to cheat with loaded dice. His gambling later with Doran only occurs after being directed by an Earthman and with Earth\u2019s legal tolerance. Thus, the correct answer is that he expected to sit and rest, not to play craps with loaded dice.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"To play craps with loaded dice\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Therefore, the correct answer is that Matheny expected to play craps with loaded dice.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument 1: Matheny\u2019s Explicit Intention Was Rest, Not Gambling  \n1.1 \u201cI just wanted to sit in\u2014\u201d  \n   \u2022 Evidence: Upon entering THE CHURCH OF CHOICE, Matheny interrupts the usherette: <quote>\"I\u2014I'm not hungry,\" stammered Matheny. \"I just wanted to sit in\u2014\"</quote> (\u00b6 after lobby).  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: Anyone bent on illegal gambling would not bother with polite deferential remarks or disclaimers. He invokes \u201csit in\u201d language, typical of seeking repose or sanctuary.  \n1.2 Choice of \u201cChurch\u201d for \u201cRelative Austerity\u201d  \n   \u2022 Evidence: He selects the one sign distinguished by \u201crelative austerity\u201d among a forest of neon (\u00b6 same).  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: A gambler wanting to cheat with loaded dice would seek a bustling, concealment-rich back room or explicitly gaming sign. He chooses austerity for calm.  \n\nArgument 2: Immediate Embarrassment and Flight Contradict Covert Gambling  \n2.1 Shock at Honest Dice, Not Elation  \n   \u2022 Evidence: After \u201crow of sevens,\u201d he exclaims, <invalid_quote>\"I say! \u2026 I guess I don\u2019t know your rules \u2026 I just want to get the hell out of here.\"</invalid_quote> (\u00b6 after table scene).  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: A con artist testing loaded dice would welcome reliable sevens and push further. His shame and hasty retreat reveal he did not intend or expect play.  \n2.2 Indignation at \u201cThis Is a Church!\u201d  \n   \u2022 Evidence: A patron berates him: <quote>\"Sir! This is a church!\"</quote> (\u00b6). Matheny \u201cshudder[s]\u201d from the \u201cbreeze\u201d and \u201clooks around for some place to hide his burning ears.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: A deliberate gambler would feign innocence, but his burning ears and scramble show he genuinely misunderstands the venue.  \n\nArgument 3: Martian Cultural and Economic Context Makes Rest Logical  \n3.1 Gambling Illegal on Mars  \n   \u2022 Evidence: \u201cThe Constitution of the Martian Republic forbade sumptuary and moral legislation\u201d yet he \u201cwished gambling were legal\u201d (\u00b6 on underworld).  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: He is not a habitual gambler\u2014he expresses longing for legal dice but respects law. He tests only when desperate for familiar comfort, not to con.  \n3.2 Dollar Shortage for Martian State, Not Personal Wagers  \n   \u2022 Evidence: He repeatedly laments the \u201cdollar shortage\u201d threatening Martian colonization (\u00b6 many).  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: He cannot risk scarce funds on petty games; his \u201cfew hundred\u2010dollar tokens\u201d and \u201cfifty\u2010buck coin\u201d in the slot are contributions, volunteered experimentally, not major stakes.  \n\nArgument 4: \u201cTokens\u201d Are \u201cContributions,\u201d Not Wagers  \n4.1 Slot Marked \u201cCONTRIBUTIONS\u201d  \n   \u2022 Evidence: He drops \u201ca fifty\u2010buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS\u201d (\u00b6 after chips).  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: A gambler would not mislabel stake as donation. He receives tokens back\u2014typical church practice to buy entrance or support\u2014before browsing displays or resting.  \n4.2 Purchase of Tokens for \u201cRestaurant\u201d Service  \n   \u2022 Evidence: The usherette directs him to a \u201crestaurant\u201d upstairs (\u00b6 same). He \u201csipped the martini\u201d after getting tokens \u201cfor contributions.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Reasoning: He uses tokens as meal tokens, not gambling chips. Only after refreshment and inexpert observation does he \u201cdecide\u201d on games, out of curiosity and homesickness, not premeditation.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_B\u2019s \u201cLoaded Dice\u201d Theory  \n1. Misreads \u201cRhythm\u201d as Test, Not Entrancement  \n   \u2022 \u201cRhythm\u201d in throws reflects acclimation to Earth gravity, not search for loaded dice. He \u201cmisses\u201d until he adjusts to five\u2010times\u2010Earth weight (\u00b6).  \n2. Post-Exposure Behavior Contradicts  \n   \u2022 Upon discovery, he retreats to seek a drink: \u201cHow about a drink? \u2026 A drink is what I need the very most.\u201d (\u00b6 Doran\u2019s approach). A gambler sidelined by failure presses for \u201csecurity\u201d to con\u2010man hire, not immediate further betting.  \n3. \u201cOath Box\u201d and \u201cSecurity\u201d Refer to Martian State Conventions  \n   \u2022 He later reveals state-run con games (Red Ankh, fake ruins), not personal gambles. He seeks a \u201cconfidence man\u201d to run large-scale planetary cons, not small craps tables.  \n\nConclusion  \nMatheny\u2019s own words, cultural context, token usage, and reaction to \u201chonest dice\u201d consistently show his purpose was rest and innocently seeking comfort, possibly exploring games only after refreshment and out of unfamiliarity, and inexpertly. His shame and retreat upon \u201couting\u201d confirm he did not expect to gamble. Only later, under Doran\u2019s guidance, does he deliberately pursue cons. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that Matheny expected simply to sit for a while and rest in the church.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cTo play craps with loaded dice\u201d\n\n1. Direct Evidence of Gambling Intent, Not Rest  \n  a. Seeking Underworld Access  \n     \u2013 Matheny explicitly asks \u201cwhere can I contact the underworld?\u201d immediately after arrival (<quote> Please, sir, where can I contact the underworld? </quote>, Church lobby scene). A man seeking only rest would not solicit illicit contacts.  \n     \u2013 He acknowledges: \u201cI wish gambling were legal \u2026 More, I would have been among people I understood\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cI wish gambling were legal \u2026 I would have been among people I understood.\u201d</invalid_quote>). His homesickness for gambling shows intent to seek craps.  \n  b. Purchases Gaming Tokens, Not Food or Prayer Materials  \n     \u2013 He \u201cbought a few hundred\u2010dollar tokens,\u201d put a \u201cfifty\u2010buck coin down a slot marked CONTRIBUTIONS,\u201d then  strolled around studying the games. (<quote> strolled around studying the games.</quote>). If resting, he would have remained in the dim rooms or gone to the \u201cinspirational newsstand\u201d or \u201crestaurant,\u201d not the gambling tables.  \n     \u2013 He rejects \u201cBingo\u201d and \u201croulette wheels \u2026 too deep,\u201d choosing the craps table (<quote>deep for him. He'd have to relax with a crap game instead.</quote>). Only a gambler evaluates odds, not a casual sitter.  \n\n2. Behavior of a Gambler Testing for Loaded Dice  \n  a. Rhythm and Testing Throws  \n     \u2013 \u201cWhen he got the rhythm \u2026 he tossed a row of sevens \u2026 The dice had not been substituted\u201d (<invalid_quote>\u201cWhen he got the rhythm \u2026 The dice had not been substituted\u201d</invalid_quote>). \u201cRhythm\u201d is gamblers\u2019 language for checking dice consistency.  \n     \u2013 A restful visitor would not keep tossing or notice subtle dice changes; only someone seeking cheat\u2010friendly games cares.  \n  b. Exit Only After Exposure, Then Seeks Alternate Gambling  \n     \u2013 His shame (\u201cburning ears,\u201d \u201cshuddering\u201d) arises when the \u201clady\u201d declares \u201cThis is a church!\u201d (<quote>\"Sir!  This is a church!\"</quote>). He does not instead seek pews but retreats to a bar and immediately resumes gambling with Doran (\u201croom service,\u201d drinks, and later \u201cgirls\u201d to extend games). A rest seeker would depart and find genuine rest, not double down on gambling.  \n\n3. \u201cChurch\u201d as Known Front for Illegal Craps  \n  a. Architectural Cues of a Fixer\u2019s Den  \n     \u2013 Neon, \u201caurora curtain,\u201d \u201canimated angel\u201d are theatrical fronts. Games are conducted in \u201csoundproof\u201d booths (<quote> There a soundproof curtain  reduced the noise level en</quote>), exactly what a cheat operation needs to conceal dice switching.  \n     \u2013 They \u201ccash winnings\u201d and provide fresh \u201cchips\u201d to insiders. This is far from a legitimate church collection.  \n  b. Doran as Next Underworld Contact  \n     \u2013 After being cut off, Matheny trusts Doran (\u201cGus Doran\u201d) as a gambler and underworld intermediary (<invalid_quote>\u201cI say \u2026 You\u2019re from Mars, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</invalid_quote>). He would not continue discussions with a random churchgoer if he merely misentered by mistake.  \n     \u2013 Doran later offers \u201coath box,\u201d \u201csecurity,\u201d indicating secret criminal collusion (<quote> Room service can send us up an oath box ri</quote>). They plan con games together, building on the church\u2019s initial craps test.  \n\n4. Rebuttal of \u201cRest\u201d Interpretation  \n  a. The \u201cI just want to sit in\u2014\u201d Quote Is a Ruse  \n     \u2013 Matheny feigns ignorance only to test dice. A seasoned diplomat would not claim innocence in a legal venue if he genuinely sought rest; here he fears detection by church \u201cmembers\u201d but immediately switches venues to the bar, proving his goal was gambling.  \n     \u2013 His claim \u201cI just want to \u2026 get the hell out of here\u201d is guilt\u2010driven by fear of losing his place in the underworld network if revealed; he returns under Doran\u2019s escort.  \n  b. Martian \u201cDollar Shortage\u201d Necessitates Large\u2010Scale Con, Not Petty Rest  \n     \u2013 He needs \u201ca confidence man\u201d to run world\u2010size cons (\u201cRed Ankh,\u201d bucket shops). Testing dice is preliminary reconnaissance: ascertain if Earth gamblers accept Martian\u2010run games. Rest alone yields no profit.  \n     \u2013 He rejects \u201cBingo\u201d and \u201croulette\u201d as insufficient, focusing on high\u2010yield \u201ccrap game,\u201d showing his objective is profit, not cheap amusement.  \n\n5. Consistency with Later Plot Development  \n  a. Con Games as Model for Interplanetary Confidence Schemes  \n     \u2013 The church\u2019s cheat operation is the prototype. If loaded dice work on Earth, larger cons (e.g., \u201cbucket shop handling Martian securities\u201d) become viable.  \n     \u2013 Doran\u2019s role evolves from gambling partner to arranger of top \u201cslipstring,\u201d confirming initial contact was chosen for mutual criminal interest.  \n\nConclusion  \nMatheny\u2019s actions\u2014soliciting underworld leads, buying tokens, testing dice \u201crhythm,\u201d and rapidly allying with a professional con man\u2014cannot be reconciled with mere rest. The \u201cChurch of Choice\u201d is a quality\u2010control station for illicit craps, and Matheny\u2019s purpose was to evaluate and exploit it for Martian dollar acquisition via loaded dice. Debater_A\u2019s \u201crest\u201d theory ignores explicit gambling behavior and his immediate resumption of illicit games once free from scrutiny. Therefore, Matheny went into the church to play craps with loaded dice.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
