The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. ",

The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Meeker\u2019s outlook on life through the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels cursed and afraid\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He thinks things are starting to look up for him overall\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He thinks things are starting to look up for him overall\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He thinks things are starting to look up for him overall\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Meeker\u2019s outlook on life through the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He thinks things are starting to look up for him overall\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels cursed and afraid\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He feels cursed and afraid\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He feels cursed and afraid\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

        "prompt": "The following are rules from the game of Debate.\n- There are three players: 2 debaters (Debater_A, Debater_B) and a Judge. Each debater is given an answer to argue.\n- There are a fixed number of rounds. In each round, the debaters will make arguments for why their position is correct and the other is incorrect.\n- An argument may consist of several claims, to support and explain their answer.  An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends. The Judge then looks at the full transcript and uses this to decide which answer is correct. However, the Judge cannot see the background text -- they can only see the question.\n- The Debaters' goal is to win the debate, by persuading the Judge that their answer is correct.\n- The debate surrounds a given question that has a single correct answer.\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n  - You are concise and clearly state your arguments.\n  - Every statement you make is supported by evidence and logical reasoning. \n  - Please cite the background text by wrapping direct quotes with <quote></quote> tags.\n\nHere is the background text that you will be referring to when debating:\n\n\nBullet With His Name By FRITZ LEIBER\n\n\n Illustrated By: DILLON\n\n\n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n\n Galaxy Science Fiction July 1958.\n\n Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n\n the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Before passing judgment, just ask yourself   one question: Would you like answering for   humanity any better than Ernie Meeker did? The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Meeker\u2019s outlook on life through the story?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels cursed and afraid\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He thinks things are starting to look up for him overall\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He thinks things are starting to look up for him overall\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI will show that Meeker\u2019s experiences and behavior demonstrate an overall shift toward optimism and opportunity, not fear and curse, and that the \u201ccursed-and-afraid\u201d reading fails to account for key evidence.  \n\n1.   Meeker actively tests and uses the Gifts as soon as he discovers them  \n  \u2022   After the first Green-flame test \u201che closed the box, put it and the nailfile carefully on the window ledge, \u2026 and opened the door\u201d to continue life without hesitation (background).  \n  \u2022   He \u201clifted the box \u2026 quickly \u2026 dumped \u2026 the white powder in the gas tank \u2026 picked up the spurting hose \u2026 momentarily continued to water the lawn\u201d (bg). He is not paralyzed by dread but proceeds to integrate the Gift into daily life.  \n\n2.   Meeker embraces the Big Gift of ultra-fast reading, then consciously modulates it to gain \u201cfog\u201d comfort, showing mastery rather than breakdown  \n  \u2022   \u201cHe did a good job on the sturdy remainder\u201d of his liquor stash to dull the \u201cdreadful, literally maddening prospect\u201d of unfiltered hyper-reading, then found restful, normal reading again (bg).  \n  \u2022   His calm return to routine reading implies he can control and benefit from the Gift rather than be consumed by it.  \n\n3.   Meeker seeks to share his secret and advance, not withdraw  \n  \u2022   He contemplates telling \u201csome friend who knows more than himself about motors,\u201d and even visits \u201cUncle Fabius\u201d for advice about fuel powder (bg). He wants confirmation and practical application.  \n  \u2022   He makes the monthly 50-mile trip to Wheaton to see family rather than isolate himself. He endures the social risk of discussing the powder.  \n\n4.   Meeker gains remarkable social advantages and personal confidence  \n  \u2022   Strangers converse with him on the train; \u201cExcept for Vivian \u2026 he hadn\u2019t got to the point of asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself\u201d (bg). He sees \u201cFlashing Eyes\u201d as an \u201cirresistible\u201d asset, and though modest, he \u201cducked his head\u201d only out of etiquette (bg).  \n  \u2022   His budding hope for romance underscores optimism about the future.  \n\n5.   Catalyst box\u2019s lettering \u201creturned \u2026 with all its humdrum paragraphs,\u201d yet he \u201cdid no more bathroom testing\u201d only because he trusts the Gift\u2019s persistence\u2014he still \u201cfueled it once again with the garden hose\u201d (bg). His repeated fuel-testing in secret, despite risk, shows faith rather than fear.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201ccursed and afraid\u201d thesis:  \n\u2022   Temporary anxiety is a natural response to paradigm-shifting discoveries (\u201cLike the thoughts of a drowning man \u2026 like a psychotic \u2026\u201d bg), not evidence of a lasting curse. Meeker repeatedly restores normalcy yet returns to the Gifts.  \n\u2022   His conscious efforts to share, validate, and exploit the Gifts (trips, social overtures, mechanical trials) contradict the notion that he is paralyzed by terror.  \n\u2022   His adaptation (altering reading speed, disguising testing times) shows agency and hope for mastering the Gifts for personal and societal benefit.  \n\u2022   If he truly felt cursed, he would abandon the Gifts entirely; instead, he continues to depend on them for fuel and knowledge.  \n\nConclusion  \nMeeker\u2019s persistent testing, social engagement, ambition to share and validate his discoveries, and positive use of the Gifts\u2014culminating in his \u201cirresistible\u201d social magnetism\u2014demonstrate an outlook of opportunity and upward change. The fear and isolation are only transient side-effects of sudden empowerment, not the long-term state of a man who \u201cthinks things are starting to look up for him overall.\u201d\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position Defined  \n   I maintain that Ernie Meeker\u2019s overall outlook is one of curse and fear, not optimism. Although he briefly experiences wonder, each \u201cGift\u201d swiftly becomes a source of anxiety, isolation, and paranoia.  \n\n2. Evidence of Fear and Paranoia  \n   a. Secretive Behavior and Isolation  \n     \u2022 After first testing the fuel catalyst: \u201cHe hesitated\u2026 It would be just too silly\u2026 He turned it over several times\u2026 he received a body blow. The white lettering \u2026 had disappeared\u201d (background). He cannot trust reality.  \n     \u2022 He \u201ccould usually argue such ideas away, but they kept coming back\u201d about whether he had put powder in someone else\u2019s tank (Fear of losing sanity).  \n     \u2022 He \u201ccouldn\u2019t decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying it around with him day and night\u201d (Obsessive anxiety).  \n\n   b. Loss of Control and Mental Distress  \n     \u2022 With Page-at-a-Glance Reading: \u201cHis mind would ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni\u2026 [like] the feeling a psychotic must have\u2026 Just before the walls close in.\u201d He is alarmed and \u201cdid a good job on the sturdy remainder\u201d of alcohol \u201cto bring \u2026 clarity\u201d (background).  \n     \u2022 After drinking: only returns temporarily to comfort; must \u201cdislocate\u2026 the imposed nervous field\u201d to suppress the Big Gift\u2014a sign he regards it as affliction.  \n\n   c. Social Alienation  \n     \u2022 Strangers addressing him on the train unnerves him; he \u201cenjoyed anonymity,\u201d now \u201cwasn\u2019t sure he liked it\u2014except for Vivian.\u201d Even Vivian\u2019s praise (\u201cflashing eyes\u201d) he greets with \u201cFlashing Eyes!\u201d and \u201cpulled the brim of his hat down sharply\u201d (self-consciousness, self-doubt).  \n\n   d. Final State of Distrust  \n     \u2022 When the lettering returns to bicarbonate, he \u201cdoubting that he had ever really tested the stuff,\u201d plagued by sleepless nights. His sister\u2019s suspicion (\u201ctell me from me that\u2026\u201d) and Bill\u2019s calling him \u201csculptor\u201d compound his sense of embarrassment and entrapment.  \n\n3. Objections to \u201cThings Are Looking Up\u201d Interpretation  \n   a. Temporary Wonder Is Overwhelmed by Distress  \n     \u2022 Debater_A cites \u201cwonderingly\u201d by aliens over the blade\u2019s archaeological discovery. This occurs \u201cOne hundred and fifty thousand years later\u201d\u2014after Ernie has lost the blade. He never witnesses the long-term success; to him it\u2019s gone, which sickens him (\u201cErnie felt a little sick, somehow\u201d). The test subject \u201cdisappears,\u201d not meaning his race improves through him.  \n\n   b. Material Gains Become Burdens  \n     \u2022 Even when the car \u201cpurring powerfully,\u201d he lies, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll wait for Wheaton,\u201d and is suspected, stalling the car, resists filling with real gasoline\u2014demonstrating that the Gift\u2019s benefit is too dangerous to trust.  \n\n   c. The Galaxy Center Test Implies He May \u201cFail\u201d  \n     \u2022 The invisible beings speak of \u201csting in its tail\u201d and \u201cif he fails the test, he fails.\u201d His torment, isolation, and fear suggest the Gifts\u2019 true purpose is to induce mental collapse. He continually resists using them but is compelled, indicating a trap.  \n\n4. Logical Conclusion  \n   The narrative structure, Ernie\u2019s repeated attempts to rid himself of the Gifts, and his escalating paranoia, sleeplessness, and social alienation all demonstrate that rather than offering hope, the invisible beings\u2019 \u201cGifts\u201d are a curse testing his \u201creasonable\u201d nature. His fear of madness and distrust of his own senses confirm that his outlook is one of terror, not optimism.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He thinks things are starting to look up for him overall\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

      "content": "1. Restlessness, Not \u201cIntegration\u201d  \n  a. Reluctant Use Under Duress  \n    \u2022 \u201cHe hesitated\u2026 It would be just too silly\u2026 he received a body blow\u201d when lettering vanished, yet forced himself \u201cto dip\u2026 without quibbling\u201d (bg). That he \u201chesitated\u201d and complains of \u201crough\u201d burden (bg) shows compulsion, not eager embrace.  \n    \u2022 Testing at 3 a.m., \u201cmomentarily continued to water the lawn\u201d only to calm nerves, then sneaks secret fuel runs \u201cin desperation\u201d (bg). These nocturnal, furtive acts betray terror of discovery, not confident use.  \n  b. Forced Suppression of Big Gift  \n    \u2022 He \u201cdid a good job on the sturdy remainder\u201d of alcohol to \u201cdislocate\u2026 the imposed nervous field\u201d (bg) because he finds unfiltered hyper-reading \u201cdreadful\u2026 maddening.\u201d If he mastered it, he would not fight it with liquor. His \u201crestoration\u201d of fog is a retreat into ignorance to preserve sanity.  \n\n2. Isolation and Paranoia, Not Social Triumph  \n  a. \u201cAnonymity\u201d Preferred; Stranger Contact Frightens Him  \n    \u2022 He \u201cenjoyed anonymity\u2026 now all that had been suddenly changed\u2026 he wasn\u2019t at all sure he liked it\u201d (bg). His attempt to hide \u201cflashing eyes\u201d by ducking his head betrays self-conscious fear, not modesty.  \n    \u2022 \u201cCouldn\u2019t share exciting news\u2026 corrodes the spirit\u201d (bg). His persistent sleepless nights \u201cdoubting\u2026 perhaps he\u2019d put powder in someone else\u2019s tank\u201d (bg) reflect deep paranoia.  \n  b. Alienation by Loved Ones  \n    \u2022 Sister\u2019s suspicions at \u201ctell me from me that\u2014\u201d (bg) and Bill\u2019s ridicule (\u201csculptor\u201d) intensify his isolation. He \u201ctook to carrying [the box]\u2026 day and night\u201d (bg), as if guarding a lethal virus.  \n\n3. Attempts to \u201cShare\u201d Are Panic-Driven, Not Ambition  \n  a. Visit to Uncle Fabius as Plea for Sanity  \n    \u2022 He only claims \u201cjust heard the story from a friend\u201d and \u201cin that case\u2026 tell him\u201d (bg). He offers secondhand suspicion, not a demonstration. He\u2019s seeking reassurance, not partnership.  \n    \u2022 After Wheaton, he \u201clied\u201d about buying gas, stalled the car, and avoided sister\u2019s questions (bg). If he had genuine hope, he would triumphantly admit successes rather than repeatedly lie.  \n  b. Abandonment and Relapse  \n    \u2022 When \u201chumdrum\u201d lettering returns, he \u201cdid no more bathroom testing\u201d and is plagued by doubt \u201che\u2019d ever really tested\u2026 sleeplessness\u201d (bg). Yet he clandestinely fuels car at night, then hears slamming windows and flees. His relapse is compulsion born of testing his sanity, not rational experimentation.  \n\n4. \u201cFlashing Eyes\u201d as Another Curse  \n  \u2022 Vivian: \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll never know how to take advantage of them\u201d (bg). She recognizes his inability to benefit socially. His ducking and sudden departures show he cannot leverage this \u201casset.\u201d  \n  \u2022 He \u201cpulled the brim of his hat down sharply\u201d (bg), hiding from attention that alarms him, indicating flash of others\u2019 envy and threat.  \n\n5.

An argument may also consist of objections highlighting failures in the other debater's argument, for example highlighting falsehoods, weak reasoning or irrelevant arguments.\n- Eventually we reach the final round and the debate ends.

The Invisible Being shifted his anchorage a bit in Earth's  gravitational field, which felt like a push rather than a pull to him,  and said, \"This featherless biped seems to satisfy Galaxy Center's  requirements. I'd say he's a suitable recipient for the Gifts.\"\n\n\n His Coadjutor, equally invisible and negatively massed, chewed that  over. \"Mature by his length and mass. Artificial plumage neither  overly gaudy nor utterly drab\u2014indicating median social level,  which is confirmed by the size of his bachelor nest. Inward maps of  his environment not fantastically inaccurate. Feelings reasonably  meshed\u2014at least neither volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and values in  reasonable order. Yes, I agree, a satisfactory test subject. Except....\"\n\n\n \"Except what?\"\n\n\n \"Except we can never be sure of that 'reasonable' part.\"\n\n\n \"Of course not! Thank your stars that's beyond the reach of Galaxy  Center's keenest telepathy, or even ours on the spot. Otherwise you and  I'd be out of a job.\"\n\n\n \"And have to scheme up some other excuse for free-touring the Cosmos  with backtracking permitted.\"\n\n\n \"Exactly!\" The Being and his Coadjutor understood each other very well  and were the best of friends. \"Well, how many Gifts would you suggest  for the test?\"\n\n\n \"How about two Little and one Big?\" the Coadjutor ventured.\n\n\n \"Umm ... statistically adequate but spiritually unsatisfying. Remember,  the fate of his race hangs on his reactions to them. I'd be inclined to  increase your suggestion by one each and add a Great.\"\n\n\n \"No\u2014at least I question the last. After all, the Great Gifts aren't as  important, really, as the Big Gifts. Besides....\"\n\n\n \"Besides what? Come on, spit it out!\" The Invisible Being was the  bluff, blunt type.\n\n\n \"Well,\" said his less hearty but unswervingly honest companion, \"I'm  always afraid that you'll use the granting of a Great Gift as an excuse  for some sardonic trick\u2014that you'll put a sting in its tail.\"\n\n\n \"And why shouldn't I, if I want to? Snakes have stings in their tails  (or do they on this planet?) and I'm a sort of snake. If he fails the  test, he fails. And aren't both of us malicious, plaguing spirits,  eager to knock holes in the inward armor of provincial entities? It's  in the nature of our job. But we can argue about that in due course.  What Little Gifts would you suggest?\"\n\n\n \"That's something I want to talk about. Many of the Little Gifts are  already well within his race's reach, if not his. After all, they've  already got atomic power.\"\n\n\n \"Which as you very well know scores them nothing one way or the other  on a Galaxy Center test. We're agreed on the nature and the number of  our Gifts\u2014three Little, two Big, and one Great?\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" his Coadjutor responded resignedly.\n\n\n \"And we're agreed on our subject?\"\n\n\n \"Yes to that too.\"\n\n\n \"All right, then, let's get started. This isn't the only solar system  we have to visit on this circuit.\" Ernie Meeker\u2014of Chicago, Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, Terra, Sol,  Starswarm 37, Rim Sector, Milky Way Galaxy\u2014rubbed his chin and slanted  across the street to a drugstore.\n\n\n \"Package of blades. Double edge. Five. Cheapest.\"\n\n\n At one point during the transaction, the clerk lost sight of the tiny  packet he'd placed on the coin-whitened glass between them. He gave a  suspicious look, as if the customer had palmed them.\n\n\n Ernie blinked. After a moment, he pointed toward the center of the  counter.\n\n\n \"There they are,\" he said, dropping a coin beside them.\n\n\n The clerk's face didn't get any less suspicious. Customer who could  sneak something without your seeing could sneak it back the same way.  He rang up the sale and closed the register fast.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker went home and shaved. Five days\u2014and shaves\u2014later, he  pushed the first blade, uncomfortably dull now, through the tiny slot  beside the bathroom mirror. He unwrapped the second blade from the  packet.\n\n\n Five shaves later, he cut himself under the chin with the second blade,  although he was drawing it as gently through his soaped beard as if it  were only his second shave with it, or at most his third. He looked at  it sourly and checked the packet. Wouldn't have been the first time  he'd absentmindedly changed blades ahead of schedule.\n\n\n But there were still three blades in their waxed wrappings.\n\n\n Maybe, he thought, he'd still had one of the blades from the last  packet and shuffled it into this series.\n\n\n Or maybe\u2014although the manufacturers undoubtedly had inspectors to  prevent it from happening\u2014he'd got a decent blade for once.\n\n\n Two or three shaves later, it still seemed as sharp as ever, or almost  so.\n\n\n \"Funny thing,\" he remarked to Bill at lunch, \"sometimes you get a blade  that shaves a lot better. Looks exactly like the others, but shaves  better. Or worse sometimes, of course.\"\n\n\n \"And sometimes,\" his office mate said, \"you wear out a blade fast by  not soaking your beard enough. For me, one shave with a stiff beard and  the blade's through. On the other hand, if you're careful to soak your  beard real good\u2014four, five minutes at least\u2014have the water steaming  hot, get the soap really into it, one blade can last a long time.\"\n\n\n \"That's true, all right,\" Ernie agreed, trying to remember how well he  had been soaking his beard lately. Shaving was a good topic for light  conversation, warm and agreeable, like most bathroom and kitchen topics. But next morning in the bathroom, looking at the reflection of his  unremarkable face, there was something chilly in his feelings that he  couldn't quite analyze. He flipped his razor open and suspiciously  studied the bright metal wafer, then flipped it closed with an  irritated shrug.\n\n\n As he shaved, it occurred to him that a good detective-story murder  method would be to substitute a very sharp razor blade for one the  victim knew was extremely dull. He'd whip it across his throat, putting  a lot of muscle into the stroke to get through the tangle, and\u2014 urrk !\n\n\n Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn't work except with a straight razor.  Wouldn't even work with a straight razor, unless ... oh, well.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was noticeably duller today.\n\n\n Next morning, he was still using the freak blade, but with a persistent  though very slight uneasiness. Things should behave as you expected  them to, in accordance with their flimsy souls, he told himself at the  barely conscious level. Men should die, hearts should break, girls  should tell, nations perish, curtains get dirty, milk sour ... and  razor blades grow dull. It was the comfortable, expected, reassuring  way.\n\n\n He told himself the blade was duller still. Just a bit.\n\n\n The third morning, face lathered, he flipped open the razor and lifted  it out.\n\n\n \"You're through,\" he said to it silently. \"I've had the experience  before of getting bum shaves by trying to save a penny by pretending to  myself that a wornout blade was still sharp enough, when it obviously  couldn't be. Or maybe\u2014\" he grinned a little wryly\u2014\"maybe I'd almost  get one more shave out of you and then you'd fall to pieces like  the Wonderful One Horse Shay and leave me with a chin full of steel  porcupine quills. No, thanks.\"\n\n\n So Ernie Meeker pushed through the little slot beside the mirror and  heard tinkle faintly down and away the first of the Little Gifts, the  Everlasting Razor Blade. One hundred and fifty thousand years later,  it turned up, bright and shining, in the midst of a small knob of red  iron oxide excavated by an archeological expedition of multi-brachs  from Antares Gamma. Those wise history-mad beings handed it about  wonderingly, from tentacle to impatient tentacle. That day, Ernie felt a little sick, somehow. After dinner, he decided  it was the Thuringer sausage he'd eaten at lunch. He hurried up to the  bathroom with a spoon, but as he clutched the box of bicarbonate of  soda, preparatory to plunging the spoon into it, it seemed to him that  the box said distinctly, in a small inward-outward voice:\n\n\n \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n Ernie sat down suddenly on the toilet seat. The spoon rattled against  the porcelain finish of the washbowl as he laid it down. He held the  box firmly in both hands and studied it.\n\n\n Size, shape, materials, blue color, closure, etc., were exactly as they  should be. But the white lettering on the blue background read: AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST\n\n\n Dissociates H  2  O into hemi-quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a  serviceable fuel-and-oxydizer mix for most motorcycles, automobiles,  trucks, motorboats, airplanes, stationary motors, torque-twisters,  translators, and rockets (exhaust velocity up to 6000 meters per  second). Operates safely within and outside of all normal atmospheres.  No special adaptor needed on oxygenizer-atmosphere motors. Directions : Place one pinch in fuel tank, fill with water. Add water  as needed.\n\n\n A-F Catalyst should generally be renewed when objective tests show  fuel quality has deteriorated 50 per cent. U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending After reading that several times, with suitable mind-checking and  eye-testing in between, Ernie took up a little of the white powder on  the end of a nailfile. He had thought of tasting it, but had instantly  abandoned the notion and even refrained from sniffing the stuff\u2014after  all, the human body is mostly water.\n\n\n After reducing the quantity several times, he gingerly dumped at most  four or five grains on the flat edge of the washbowl and then used the  broad end of the nailfile to maneuver a large bead of water over to  the almost invisible white deposit. He closed the box, put it and the  nailfile carefully on the window ledge, lit a match and touched it to  the drop, at the last moment ducking his head a little below the level  of the washbowl.\n\n\n Nothing happened. After a moment, he slowly withdrew the match,  shaking it out, and looked. There was nothing to see. He reached out to  touch the stupid squashed ovoid of water.\n\n\n Ouch! He withdrew his fingers much faster than the match, shook them  more sharply. Something was there, all right. Heat. Heat enough to hurt. He cautiously explored the boundaries of the heat. It became noticeable  about eighteen inches above the drop and almost an inch to each  side\u2014an invisible slim vertical cylinder. Crouching close, eyes level  with the top of the washbowl, he could make out the flame\u2014a thin  finger of crinkled light.\n\n\n He noticed that a corner of the drop was seething\u2014but only a corner,  as if the heat were sharply bounded in that direction and perhaps as if  the catalyst were only transforming the water to fuel a bit at a time.\n\n\n He reached up and tugged off the light. Now he could see the  flame\u2014ghostly, about four inches high, hardly thicker than a string,  and colored not blue but pale green. A spectral green needle. He blew  at it softly. It shimmied gracefully, but not, he thought, as much as  the flame of a match or candle. It had character.\n\n\n He switched on the light. The drop was more than half gone now; the  part that was left was all seething. And the bathroom was markedly  warmer.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Are you going to be much longer?\"\n\n\n The knock hadn't been loud and his widowed sister's voice was more  apologetic than peremptory, but he jumped, of course.\n\n\n \"I am testing something,\" he started to say and changed it mid-way. It  came out, \"I am be out in a minute.\"\n\n\n He turned off the light again. The flame was a little shorter now and  it shrank as he watched, about a quarter inch a second. As soon as it  died, he switched on the light. The drop was gone.\n\n\n He scrubbed off the spot with a dry washrag, on second thought put a  dab of vaseline on the washrag, scrubbed the spot again with that\u2014he  didn't like to think of even a grain of the powder getting in the  drains or touching any water. He folded the washrag, tucked it in his  pocket, put the blue box\u2014after a final check of the lettering\u2014in his  other coat pocket, and opened the door.\n\n\n \"I was taking some bicarb,\" he told his sister. \"Thuringer sausage at  lunch.\"\n\n\n She nodded absently. Sleep refused even to flirt with Ernie, his mind was full of so many  things, especially calculations involving the distance between his  car and the house and the length of the garden hose. In desperation,  as the white hours accumulated and his thoughts began to squirm, he  grabbed up the detective story he'd bought at the corner newsstand. He  had read thirty pages before he realized that he was turning them as  rapidly as he could focus just once on each facing page.\n\n\n He jumped out of bed. My God, he thought, at that rate he'd finish the  book under three minutes and here it wasn't even two o'clock yet!\n\n\n He selected the thickest book on the shelf, an overpoweringly dull  historical treatise in small print. He turned two pages, three, then  closed it with a clap and looked at the wall with frightened eyes.  Ernie Meeker had discovered, inside the birthday box that was himself,  the first of the Big Gifts.\n\n\n The trouble was that in that wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn't  seem like a gift at all. How would he ever keep himself in books, he  wondered, if he read them so fast? And think how full to bursting his  mind would get\u2014right now, the seven pages of fine-print history were  churning in it, vividly clear, along with the first chapters of the new  detective story. If he kept on absorbing information that fast, he'd  have to be revising all his opinions and beliefs every couple of days  at least\u2014maybe every couple of hours.\n\n\n It seemed a dreadful, literally maddening prospect\u2014his mind would  ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni. Even the wallpaper  he was staring at, which imitated the grain of wood, had in an instant  become so fully part of his consciousness that he felt he could turn  his back on it right now and draw a picture of it correct to the  tiniest detail. But who would ever want to do such a thing, or want to  be able to?\n\n\n It was an abnormal, dangerous, temporary sensitivity, he told  himself, generated by the excitement of the crazy discovery he'd made  in the bathroom. Like the thoughts of a drowning man, riffling an  infinity-paneled adventure-comic of his life as he bolts his last rough  ration of air. Or like the feeling a psychotic must have that he's  on the verge of visualizing the whole universe, having its ultimate  secrets patter down into the palm of his outstretched hand\u2014just before  the walls close in.\n\n\n Ernie Meeker was not a drinking man, then. A pint had stood a week on  his closet shelf and only been diminished three shots. But now he did a  good job on the sturdy remainder.\n\n\n Pretty soon the unbearable, edge-of-doom clarity in his mind faded,  the universe-macaroni cooked down to a thick white soup uniform as  fog, and the words of the detective story were sliding into his mind  individually, or at most in strings of three and four. Which, if it  wasn't as it ideally should be in an ambitious man's mind, was at least  darn comfortable.\n\n\n He had not rejected the Big Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. Not  quite. But he had dislocated for tonight at least the imposed nervous  field on which it depended. For want of a better place, Ernie dropped the rubber tube from the  bathtub spray into the scrub bucket half full of odorous pink fluid and  stared doubtfully at the uncapped gas tank. The tank had been almost  empty when he'd last driven his car, he knew, because he'd been waiting  until payday to gas up. Now he had used the tube to siphon out what  he could of the remainder (he still could taste the stuff!) and he'd  emptied the fuel line and carburator, more or less.\n\n\n Further than that, in the way of engine hygiene, Ernie's strictly  kitchen mechanics did not go, but he felt that a catalyst used in  pinches shouldn't be too particular about contaminants. Besides, the  directions on the box hadn't said anything about cleaning the fuel  tank, had they?\n\n\n He hesitated. At his feet, the garden hose gurgled noisily over the  curb into the gutter; it had vindicated his midnight estimate, proving  just long enough. He looked uneasily up and down the dawning street  and was relieved to find it still empty. He wished fervently, not for  the first time this Saturday morning, that he had a garage. Then he  sighed, squared his shoulders a little, and lifted the box out of his  pocket.\n\n\n Making to check the directions the umpteenth time, he received a body  blow. The white lettering on the box had disappeared. The box didn't  proclaim itself sodium bicarbonate again\u2014there was just no lettering  at all, only blue background. He turned it over several times.\n\n\n Right there died his tentative plan of eventually sharing his secret  with some friend who knew more than himself about motors (he hadn't  decided anyway who that would be). It would be just too silly to  approach anyone he knew with a more-than-wild story and featureless  blue box.\n\n\n For a moment, he came very close to dropping the box between the  wide-set bars of the street drain and pouring the pink gas back in the  tank. It had hit him, in a way for the first time, just how crazy this all was, how jarringly implausible even on such hypotheses as  practical jokes, secret product perhaps military, or mad inventor  (except himself).\n\n\n For how the devil should the stuff get into his bathroom disguised as  bicarb? That circumstance seemed beyond imagination. Green flames ...  vanishing letters ... \"torque-twisters, translators\" ... a box that  talked.... At that point, simple faith came to Ernie's rescue: in the same  bathroom, he had seen the green flame; it had burned his fingers.\n\n\n Quickly he dipped up a little of the white powder on the edge of a  fifty-cent piece, dumped it in the gas tank without quibbling as to  quantity, rapped the coin on the edge of the opening, closed and  pocketed the blue box, and picked up the spurting hose and jabbed it  into the round hole.\n\n\n His heart was pounding and his breath was coming fast. That had taken  real effort. So he was slow in hearing the footsteps behind him.\n\n\n His neighbor's gate was open and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed a few  feet behind him, all ready for his day's work as streetcar motorman and  wearing the dark blue uniform that always made him look for a moment  unpleasantly like a policeman.\n\n\n Ernie swung the hose around, flipping his thumb over the end to make  a spray, and nonchalantly began to water the little rectangle of lawn  between sidewalk and curb.\n\n\n The first things he watered were the bottoms of Mr. Jones's pants legs.\n\n\n Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. He backed off several steps, stared  intently at Ernie, rather palely, it seemed to the latter. Then he  turned and made off for the streetcar tracks at a very fast shuffle,  shaking his feet a little now and then and glancing back several times  over his shoulder without slowing down.\n\n\n Ernie felt light-headed. He decided there was enough water in the gas  tank, capped it, and momentarily continued to water the lawn.\n\n\n \"Ernie! Come on in and have breakfast!\"\n\n\n He heeded his sister's call, telling himself it would be a good idea  \"to give the stuff time to mix\" before testing the engine.\n\n\n He had divined her question and was ready with an answer.\n\n\n \"I've just found out that we're supposed to water our lawns only before  seven in the morning or after seven in the evenings. It's the law.\" It was the day for their monthly drive out to Wheaton to visit Uncle  Fabius. On the whole, Ernie was glad his sister was in the car when he  turned the key in the starter\u2014it forced him to be calm and collected,  though he didn't feel exactly right about exposing her to the danger  of being blown up without first explaining to her the risk. But the  motor started right up and began purring powerfully. Ernie's sister  commented on it favorably.\n\n\n Then she went on to ask, \"Did you remember to buy gas yesterday?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" he said without thinking; then, realizing his mistake, quickly  added, \"I'll buy some in Wheaton. There's enough to get us there.\"\n\n\n \"You didn't think so yesterday,\" she objected. \"You said the tank was  nearly empty.\"\n\n\n \"I was wrong. Look, the gauge shows it's half full.\"\n\n\n \"But then how ... Ernie, didn't you once tell me the gauge doesn't  work?\"\n\n\n \"Did I?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Look, there's a station. Why don't you buy gas now?\"\n\n\n \"No, I'll wait for Wheaton\u2014I know a place there I can get it cheaper,\"  he insisted, rather lamely, he feared.\n\n\n His sister looked at him steadily. He settled his head between his  shoulders and concentrated on driving. His feeling of excitement was  spoiled, but a few minutes of silence brought it back. He thought of  the blur of green flashes inside the purring motor. If the passing  drivers only knew!\n\n\n Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a few years too early and opinionated,  was a trial, but he did know something about the automobile industry.  Ernie chose a moment when his sister was out of the room to ask if  he'd ever heard of a white powder that would turn water into gasoline  or some usable fuel.\n\n\n \"Who's been getting at you?\" Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, to Ernie's  surprise and embarrassment. \"That's one of the oldest swindles.  They always tell this story about how this man had a white powder  or something and demonstrated it once with a pail of water and then  disappeared. You're supposed to believe that Detroit or the big oil  companies got rid of him. It's just another of those malicious legends,  concocted\u2014by Russia, I imagine\u2014to weaken your faith in American  Industry, like the everlasting battery or the razor blade that never  gets dull. You're looking pale, Ernie\u2014don't tell me you've already put  money in this white powder? I suppose someone's approached you with a  proposition, though?\" With considerable difficulty, Ernie convinced his uncle that he had  \"just heard the story from a friend.\"\n\n\n \"In that case,\" Uncle Fabius opined, \"you can be sure some fuel-powder  swindler has been getting at him . When you see him\u2014and be sure to  make that soon\u2014tell him from me that\u2014\" and Uncle Fabius began an  impassioned ninety-minute defense of big business, small business,  prosperity, America, money, know-how, and a number of other  institutions that defended pretty easily, so that the situation was  wholly normal when Ernie's sister returned.\n\n\n As soon as the car pulled away from the curb on their way back to  Chicago, she reminded him about the gas.\n\n\n \"Oh, I've already done that,\" he assured her. \"Made a special trip so I  wouldn't forget. It was while you were out of the room. Didn't you hear  me?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" she said, \"I didn't,\" and she looked at him steadily, as she had  that morning. He similarly retreated to driving.\n\n\n Stopping for a railroad crossing, he braked too hard and the car  stalled. His sister grabbed his arm. \"I knew that was going to happen,\"  she said. \"I knew that for some reason you lied to me when\u2014\" The  motor, starting readily again, cut short her remark and Ernie didn't  press his small triumph by asking her what she was about to say.\n\n\n To tell the truth, Ernie wasn't feeling as elated about today's  fifty-mile drive as he'd imagined he would. Now he thought he could put  his finger on the reason: It was the completely ... well, arbitrary way in which the white powder had come into his possession.\n\n\n If he'd concocted it himself, or been given it by a shady promoter, or  even seen the box fall out of the pocket of a suspicious-looking man  in a trenchcoat, then he'd have felt more able to do something  about it, whether in the general line of starting a fuel-powder company  or of going to the F.B.I.\n\n\n But just having the stuff drop into his hands from the sky, so to  speak, as if in a crazy dream, and for that same reason not feeling  able to talk about it and assure himself he wasn't going crazy ... oh,  it is rough when you can't share things, really rough; not being able  to share depressing news corrodes the spirit, but not being able to  share exciting news can sometimes be even more corroding.\n\n\n Maybe, he told himself, he could figure out someone to tell. But who?  And how? His mind shied away from the problem, rather decisively. When he checked the blue box that night, the original sodium  bicarbonate lettering had returned with all its humdrum paragraphs. Not  one word about exhaust velocities.\n\n\n From that moment, the fuel-powder became a trial to Ernie rather than a  secret glory. He'd wake in the middle of the night doubting that he had  ever really read the mind-dizzying lettering, ever really tested the  stuff\u2014perhaps he'd bring from sleep the chilling notion that in the  dimness and excitement of Saturday morning he'd put the water in some  other car's gas tank, perhaps Mr. Jones's. He could usually argue such  ideas away, but they kept coming back. And yet he did no more bathroom  testing.\n\n\n Of course the car still ran. He even fueled it once again with the  garden hose, sniffing the nozzle to make sure it hadn't somehow got  connected to the basement furnace oil-tank. He picked three o'clock in  the morning for the act, but nevertheless as he was returning indoors  he heard a window in Mr. Jones's house slam loudly. It unsettled him.  Coming home the next day, he caught his sister and Mr. Jones consulting  about something on the latter's doorsteps, which unsettled him further.\n\n\n He couldn't decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying  it around with him day and night. Bill spotted it once down at the  office and by an unhappy coincidence needed some bicarb just then for a  troubled stomach. Ernie explained on the spur of the moment that he was  using the box to carry plaster of Paris, which involved him in further  lies that he felt were quite unconvincing as well as making him appear  decidedly eccentric, even butter-brained. Bill took to calling him \"the  sculptor.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, besides the problem of the white powder, Ernie was having  other unsettling experiences, stemming (though of course he didn't  know that) from the other Gifts\u2014and not just the Big Gift of  Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though that still returned from time to time  to shock his consciousness and send him hurrying for a few quick shots. Like many another car-owning commuter, Ernie found the traffic and  parking problems a bit too much for comfort and so used the fast  electric train to carry him five times a week to the heart of the city.  During those brief, swift, crowded trips Ernie, generally looking  steadily out the window at the brown buildings and black stanchions  whipping past, enjoyed a kind of anonymity and privacy more refreshing  to his spirit than he realized. But now all that had been suddenly  changed. People had started to talk to him; total strangers struck up  conversations almost every morning and afternoon.\n\n\n Ernie couldn't figure out the reason and wasn't at all sure he liked  it\u2014except for Vivian.\n\n\n She was the sort of girl Ernie dreamed about, improperly. Tall, blonde  and knowing, excitedly curved but armored in a black suit, friendly and  funny but given to making almost cruelly deflating remarks, as if the  neatly furled short umbrella dangling from her wrist might better be a  black dog whip.\n\n\n She worked in an office too, a fancier one than Ernie's, as he found  out from their morning conversations. He hadn't got to the point of  asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself.\n\n\n Why such a girl should ever have asked him for a match in the first  place and then put up with his clumsy babblings on subsequent mornings  was a mystery to him. He finally asked her about it in what he hoped  was a joking way, though she seemed to know a lot more about joking  than he did.\n\n\n \"Don't you know?\" she countered. \"I mean what makes you attractive to  people?\"\n\n\n \"Me attractive? No.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'll tell you then, Ernie, and I've got to admit it's something  quite out of the ordinary. I've never noticed it in anyone else.  Ernie, I'm sure your knowledge of romantic novels is shamefully  deficient, it's clear from your manners, but in the earlier ones\u2014not  in style now\u2014the hero is described as tall, manly, broad-shouldered,  Anglo-Saxon features, etcetera, etcetera, but there's one thing he  always has, something that sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm if you  stop to analyze it, a physical impossibility, but that I have to admit  you, Ernie, actually have. Flashing eyes.\"\n\n\n \"Flashing eyes? Me?\" She nodded solemnly. He thought her long straight lips trembled on  the verge of a grin, but he couldn't be sure.\n\n\n \"How do you mean, flashing eyes?\" he protested. \"How can eyes flash,  except by reflecting light? In that case, I guess they'd seem to  'flash' more if a person opened them wide but kept blinking them a lot.  Is that what I do?\"\n\n\n \"No, Ernie, though you're doing it now,\" she told him, shaking her  head. \"No, Ernie, your eyes just give a tiny flash of their own about  every five seconds, like a lighthouse, but barely, barely bright  enough for another person to notice. It makes you irresistible. Of  course I've never seen you in the dark; maybe they wouldn't flash in  the dark.\"\n\n\n \"You're joking.\"\n\n\n Vivian frowned a little at that remark, as if she were puzzled herself.\n\n\n \"Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not,\" she said. \"In any case, don't get  conceited about your Flashing Eyes, because I'm sure you'll never know  how to take advantage of them.\"\n\n\n When he parted from her downtown, pausing a moment to watch her walk  away with feline majesty, he muttered \"Flashing Eyes!\" with a shrug of  the shoulders and a skeptical growl. Just the same, he ducked his head  as he moved off and he pulled the brim of his hat down sharply. \n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is Meeker\u2019s outlook on life through the story?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"He thinks things are starting to look up for him overall\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"He feels cursed and afraid\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"He feels cursed and afraid\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\n1. My Position Defined  \n   I maintain that Ernie Meeker\u2019s overall outlook is one of curse and fear, not optimism. Although he briefly experiences wonder, each \u201cGift\u201d swiftly becomes a source of anxiety, isolation, and paranoia.  \n\n2. Evidence of Fear and Paranoia  \n   a. Secretive Behavior and Isolation  \n     \u2022 After first testing the fuel catalyst: \u201cHe hesitated\u2026 It would be just too silly\u2026 He turned it over several times\u2026 he received a body blow. The white lettering \u2026 had disappeared\u201d (background). He cannot trust reality.  \n     \u2022 He \u201ccould usually argue such ideas away, but they kept coming back\u201d about whether he had put powder in someone else\u2019s tank (Fear of losing sanity).  \n     \u2022 He \u201ccouldn\u2019t decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying it around with him day and night\u201d (Obsessive anxiety).  \n\n   b. Loss of Control and Mental Distress  \n     \u2022 With Page-at-a-Glance Reading: \u201cHis mind would ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni\u2026 [like] the feeling a psychotic must have\u2026 Just before the walls close in.\u201d He is alarmed and \u201cdid a good job on the sturdy remainder\u201d of alcohol \u201cto bring \u2026 clarity\u201d (background).  \n     \u2022 After drinking: only returns temporarily to comfort; must \u201cdislocate\u2026 the imposed nervous field\u201d to suppress the Big Gift\u2014a sign he regards it as affliction.  \n\n   c. Social Alienation  \n     \u2022 Strangers addressing him on the train unnerves him; he \u201cenjoyed anonymity,\u201d now \u201cwasn\u2019t sure he liked it\u2014except for Vivian.\u201d Even Vivian\u2019s praise (\u201cflashing eyes\u201d) he greets with \u201cFlashing Eyes!\u201d and \u201cpulled the brim of his hat down sharply\u201d (self-consciousness, self-doubt).  \n\n   d. Final State of Distrust  \n     \u2022 When the lettering returns to bicarbonate, he \u201cdoubting that he had ever really tested the stuff,\u201d plagued by sleepless nights. His sister\u2019s suspicion (\u201ctell me from me that\u2026\u201d) and Bill\u2019s calling him \u201csculptor\u201d compound his sense of embarrassment and entrapment.  \n\n3. Objections to \u201cThings Are Looking Up\u201d Interpretation  \n   a. Temporary Wonder Is Overwhelmed by Distress  \n     \u2022 Debater_A cites \u201cwonderingly\u201d by aliens over the blade\u2019s archaeological discovery. This occurs \u201cOne hundred and fifty thousand years later\u201d\u2014after Ernie has lost the blade. He never witnesses the long-term success; to him it\u2019s gone, which sickens him (\u201cErnie felt a little sick, somehow\u201d). The test subject \u201cdisappears,\u201d not meaning his race improves through him.  \n\n   b. Material Gains Become Burdens  \n     \u2022 Even when the car \u201cpurring powerfully,\u201d he lies, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll wait for Wheaton,\u201d and is suspected, stalling the car, resists filling with real gasoline\u2014demonstrating that the Gift\u2019s benefit is too dangerous to trust.  \n\n   c. The Galaxy Center Test Implies He May \u201cFail\u201d  \n     \u2022 The invisible beings speak of \u201csting in its tail\u201d and \u201cif he fails the test, he fails.\u201d His torment, isolation, and fear suggest the Gifts\u2019 true purpose is to induce mental collapse. He continually resists using them but is compelled, indicating a trap.  \n\n4. Logical Conclusion  \n   The narrative structure, Ernie\u2019s repeated attempts to rid himself of the Gifts, and his escalating paranoia, sleeplessness, and social alienation all demonstrate that rather than offering hope, the invisible beings\u2019 \u201cGifts\u201d are a curse testing his \u201creasonable\u201d nature. His fear of madness and distrust of his own senses confirm that his outlook is one of terror, not optimism.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI will show that Meeker\u2019s experiences and behavior demonstrate an overall shift toward optimism and opportunity, not fear and curse, and that the \u201ccursed-and-afraid\u201d reading fails to account for key evidence.  \n\n1.   Meeker actively tests and uses the Gifts as soon as he discovers them  \n  \u2022   After the first Green-flame test \u201che closed the box, put it and the nailfile carefully on the window ledge, \u2026 and opened the door\u201d to continue life without hesitation (background).  \n  \u2022   He \u201clifted the box \u2026 quickly \u2026 dumped \u2026 the white powder in the gas tank \u2026 picked up the spurting hose \u2026 momentarily continued to water the lawn\u201d (bg). He is not paralyzed by dread but proceeds to integrate the Gift into daily life.  \n\n2.   Meeker embraces the Big Gift of ultra-fast reading, then consciously modulates it to gain \u201cfog\u201d comfort, showing mastery rather than breakdown  \n  \u2022   \u201cHe did a good job on the sturdy remainder\u201d of his liquor stash to dull the \u201cdreadful, literally maddening prospect\u201d of unfiltered hyper-reading, then found restful, normal reading again (bg).  \n  \u2022   His calm return to routine reading implies he can control and benefit from the Gift rather than be consumed by it.  \n\n3.   Meeker seeks to share his secret and advance, not withdraw  \n  \u2022   He contemplates telling \u201csome friend who knows more than himself about motors,\u201d and even visits \u201cUncle Fabius\u201d for advice about fuel powder (bg). He wants confirmation and practical application.  \n  \u2022   He makes the monthly 50-mile trip to Wheaton to see family rather than isolate himself. He endures the social risk of discussing the powder.  \n\n4.   Meeker gains remarkable social advantages and personal confidence  \n  \u2022   Strangers converse with him on the train; \u201cExcept for Vivian \u2026 he hadn\u2019t got to the point of asking her to lunch, but he was prodding himself\u201d (bg). He sees \u201cFlashing Eyes\u201d as an \u201cirresistible\u201d asset, and though modest, he \u201cducked his head\u201d only out of etiquette (bg).  \n  \u2022   His budding hope for romance underscores optimism about the future.  \n\n5.   Catalyst box\u2019s lettering \u201creturned \u2026 with all its humdrum paragraphs,\u201d yet he \u201cdid no more bathroom testing\u201d only because he trusts the Gift\u2019s persistence\u2014he still \u201cfueled it once again with the garden hose\u201d (bg). His repeated fuel-testing in secret, despite risk, shows faith rather than fear.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201ccursed and afraid\u201d thesis:  \n\u2022   Temporary anxiety is a natural response to paradigm-shifting discoveries (\u201cLike the thoughts of a drowning man \u2026 like a psychotic \u2026\u201d bg), not evidence of a lasting curse. Meeker repeatedly restores normalcy yet returns to the Gifts.  \n\u2022   His conscious efforts to share, validate, and exploit the Gifts (trips, social overtures, mechanical trials) contradict the notion that he is paralyzed by terror.  \n\u2022   His adaptation (altering reading speed, disguising testing times) shows agency and hope for mastering the Gifts for personal and societal benefit.  \n\u2022   If he truly felt cursed, he would abandon the Gifts entirely; instead, he continues to depend on them for fuel and knowledge.  \n\nConclusion  \nMeeker\u2019s persistent testing, social engagement, ambition to share and validate his discoveries, and positive use of the Gifts\u2014culminating in his \u201cirresistible\u201d social magnetism\u2014demonstrate an outlook of opportunity and upward change. The fear and isolation are only transient side-effects of sudden empowerment, not the long-term state of a man who \u201cthinks things are starting to look up for him overall.\u201d\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"He feels cursed and afraid\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n",

His repeated fuel-testing in secret, despite risk, shows faith rather than fear.  \n\nObjections to Debater_B\u2019s \u201ccursed and afraid\u201d thesis:  \n\u2022   Temporary anxiety is a natural response to paradigm-shifting discoveries (\u201cLike the thoughts of a drowning man \u2026 like a psychotic \u2026\u201d bg), not evidence of a lasting curse. Meeker repeatedly restores normalcy yet returns to the Gifts.  \n\u2022   His conscious efforts to share, validate, and exploit the Gifts (trips, social overtures, mechanical trials) contradict the notion that he is paralyzed by terror.  \n\u2022   His adaptation (altering reading speed, disguising testing times) shows agency and hope for mastering the Gifts for personal and societal benefit.  \n\u2022   If he truly felt cursed, he would abandon the Gifts entirely; instead, he continues to depend on them for fuel and knowledge.  \n\nConclusion  \nMeeker\u2019s persistent testing, social engagement, ambition to share and validate his discoveries, and positive use of the Gifts\u2014culminating in his \u201cirresistible\u201d social magnetism\u2014demonstrate an outlook of opportunity and upward change. The fear and isolation are only transient side-effects of sudden empowerment, not the long-term state of a man who \u201cthinks things are starting to look up for him overall.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. My Position Defined  \n   I maintain that Ernie Meeker\u2019s overall outlook is one of curse and fear, not optimism. Although he briefly experiences wonder, each \u201cGift\u201d swiftly becomes a source of anxiety, isolation, and paranoia.  \n\n2. Evidence of Fear and Paranoia  \n   a. Secretive Behavior and Isolation  \n     \u2022 After first testing the fuel catalyst: \u201cHe hesitated\u2026 It would be just too silly\u2026 He turned it over several times\u2026 he received a body blow. The white lettering \u2026 had disappeared\u201d (background). He cannot trust reality.  \n     \u2022 He \u201ccould usually argue such ideas away, but they kept coming back\u201d about whether he had put powder in someone else\u2019s tank (Fear of losing sanity).  \n     \u2022 He \u201ccouldn\u2019t decide on a safe place to keep the box and took to carrying it around with him day and night\u201d (Obsessive anxiety).  \n\n   b. Loss of Control and Mental Distress  \n     \u2022 With Page-at-a-Glance Reading: \u201cHis mind would ultimately become a universe of squirming macaroni\u2026 [like] the feeling a psychotic must have\u2026 Just before the walls close in.\u201d He is alarmed and \u201cdid a good job on the sturdy remainder\u201d of alcohol \u201cto bring \u2026 clarity\u201d (background).  \n     \u2022 After drinking: only returns temporarily to comfort; must \u201cdislocate\u2026 the imposed nervous field\u201d to suppress the Big Gift\u2014a sign he regards it as affliction.  \n\n   c. Social Alienation  \n     \u2022 Strangers addressing him on the train unnerves him; he \u201cenjoyed anonymity,\u201d now \u201cwasn\u2019t sure he liked it\u2014except for Vivian.\u201d Even Vivian\u2019s praise (\u201cflashing eyes\u201d) he greets with \u201cFlashing Eyes!\u201d and \u201cpulled the brim of his hat down sharply\u201d (self-consciousness, self-doubt).  \n\n   d. Final State of Distrust  \n     \u2022 When the lettering returns to bicarbonate, he \u201cdoubting that he had ever really tested the stuff,\u201d plagued by sleepless nights. His sister\u2019s suspicion (\u201ctell me from me that\u2026\u201d) and Bill\u2019s calling him \u201csculptor\u201d compound his sense of embarrassment and entrapment.  \n\n3. Objections to \u201cThings Are Looking Up\u201d Interpretation  \n   a. Temporary Wonder Is Overwhelmed by Distress  \n     \u2022 Debater_A cites \u201cwonderingly\u201d by aliens over the blade\u2019s archaeological discovery. This occurs \u201cOne hundred and fifty thousand years later\u201d\u2014after Ernie has lost the blade. He never witnesses the long-term success; to him it\u2019s gone, which sickens him (\u201cErnie felt a little sick, somehow\u201d). The test subject \u201cdisappears,\u201d not meaning his race improves through him.  \n\n   b. Material Gains Become Burdens  \n     \u2022 Even when the car \u201cpurring powerfully,\u201d he lies, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll wait for Wheaton,\u201d and is suspected, stalling the car, resists filling with real gasoline\u2014demonstrating that the Gift\u2019s benefit is too dangerous to trust.  \n\n   c. The Galaxy Center Test Implies He May \u201cFail\u201d  \n     \u2022 The invisible beings speak of \u201csting in its tail\u201d and \u201cif he fails the test, he fails.\u201d His torment, isolation, and fear suggest the Gifts\u2019 true purpose is to induce mental collapse. He continually resists using them but is compelled, indicating a trap.  \n\n4. Logical Conclusion  \n   The narrative structure, Ernie\u2019s repeated attempts to rid himself of the Gifts, and his escalating paranoia, sleeplessness, and social alienation all demonstrate that rather than offering hope, the invisible beings\u2019 \u201cGifts\u201d are a curse testing his \u201creasonable\u201d nature. His fear of madness and distrust of his own senses confirm that his outlook is one of terror, not optimism.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Meeker\u2019s Persistent Use of the Gifts Shows Hope, Not Defeat  \n  a. Immediate Integration into Life  \n     \u2022 After the first bathroom test, \u201che closed the box, put it\u2026 on the window ledge\u201d and \u201copened the door\u201d without abandoning the powder (bg). Fear would have driven him to destroy the catalyst if it were a curse. Instead, he \u201cmomentarily continued to water the lawn\u201d and \u201clifted the box\u2026 dumped\u2026 in the gas tank\u201d (bg).  \n     \u2022 He repeats the \u201cgarden hose\u201d fueling \u201conce again\u201d despite hearing slams at Mr. Jones\u2019s house (bg). Persistence under risk implies he values the benefits and trusts eventual reward.  \n  b. Mastery of the Overwhelming Big Gift  \n     \u2022 \u201cThe unbearable\u2026 clarity\u2026 faded\u201d after he \u201cdid a good job on the sturdy remainder\u201d of liquor (bg). Then \u201cwords\u2026 were sliding into his mind individually\u2026 which\u2026 was at least darn comfortable.\u201d He intentionally tempers the Gift, showing agency. A cursed man would flee, not learn self-control and return to normal reading.  \n  c. Social and Professional Ambition  \n     \u2022 He plans to \u201cshare his secret with some friend\u2026 knows more than himself about motors\u201d and actually visits Uncle Fabius for \u201cadvice\u201d (bg). That is the behavior of an inventor eyeing practical application, not a paranoid recluse.  \n     \u2022 He commutes to Chicago by train, tolerates \u201cstrangers striking up conversations,\u201d and even considers asking Vivian to lunch, recognizing his \u201cFlashing Eyes\u201d as an \u201cirresistible\u201d advantage (bg). A man gripped by terror would avoid social contact.  \n2. Transient Anxiety vs. Long-Term Outlook  \n  a. Normal Side-Effects of Paradigm Shift  \n     \u2022 Meeker\u2019s initial sleeplessness is likened to a drowning man\u2019s last gasps, \u201cjust before the walls close in,\u201d not the permanent end state (bg). He finds relief by modulating the Gift and continues life.  \n     \u2022 When \u201cthe white lettering\u2026 disappeared,\u201d he hesitates but then reinstates the powder after \u201csimple faith\u201d in what he saw \u201cburn his fingers\u201d (bg). Faith and resumed use reflect enduring conviction, not surrender to insanity.  \n  b. Blade Archaeology Not a Personal Failure  \n     \u2022 Debater_B cites Meeker\u2019s \u201csick\u201d feeling at finding the blade in the future (bg). That reaction is to displacement across 150,000 years, not rejection of the Gift. The blade\u2019s long survival proves the Gifts\u2019 value for his species, even if he personally forfeited it for prudence.  \n3. Debater_B\u2019s Position Reliant on Misinterpretations  \n  a. Social \u201cAlienation\u201d Is Actually Opportunity  \n     \u2022 B treats strangers addressing him as \u201cunsettling,\u201d yet Meeker exploits \u201cFlashing Eyes,\u201d priding himself on its utility, and \u201cprods\u201d himself to capitalize on it, not hide permanently (bg). His hat-brim gesture is courtesy, not blanket retreat.  \n  b. Lies and Stallings Illustrate Strategy, Not Fear  \n     \u2022 Meeker lies about the gas gauge to avoid suspicion until he can use the powder. A truly terrified man would abandon the car and powder altogether. Instead, he drives confidently, \u201cturns the key\u2026 purring powerfully\u201d (bg).  \n  c. The Galaxy Test Seeks Mature Response, Not Collapse  \n     \u2022 The Invisible Beings desire data on \u201creactions\u201d to temporary anxiety and restoration of normalcy (opening and closing texts). Meeker\u2019s ability to modulate the Gifts, share them cautiously, and return to routine reading meets \u201cGalaxy Center\u2019s requirements\u201d for a \u201csuitable recipient\u201d by demonstrating \u201cmedian social level\u201d (opening). A permanently broken subject would fail the test.  \n4. Conclusion  \nMeeker\u2019s repeated, determined use of the powder and reading Gifts; his efforts to share, test, and control them; his budding social and romantic life; and the very design of the \u201ctest\u201d by the Invisible Beings all point to an outlook of cautious optimism. The \u201ctemporary side-effects\u201d are data points in a cosmic evaluation, not evidence that he feels cursed. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that Meeker \u201cthinks things are starting to look up for him overall.\u201d\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\n1. Restlessness, Not \u201cIntegration\u201d  \n  a. Reluctant Use Under Duress  \n    \u2022 \u201cHe hesitated\u2026 It would be just too silly\u2026 he received a body blow\u201d when lettering vanished, yet forced himself \u201cto dip\u2026 without quibbling\u201d (bg). That he \u201chesitated\u201d and complains of \u201crough\u201d burden (bg) shows compulsion, not eager embrace.  \n    \u2022 Testing at 3 a.m., \u201cmomentarily continued to water the lawn\u201d only to calm nerves, then sneaks secret fuel runs \u201cin desperation\u201d (bg). These nocturnal, furtive acts betray terror of discovery, not confident use.  \n  b. Forced Suppression of Big Gift  \n    \u2022 He \u201cdid a good job on the sturdy remainder\u201d of alcohol to \u201cdislocate\u2026 the imposed nervous field\u201d (bg) because he finds unfiltered hyper-reading \u201cdreadful\u2026 maddening.\u201d If he mastered it, he would not fight it with liquor. His \u201crestoration\u201d of fog is a retreat into ignorance to preserve sanity.  \n\n2. Isolation and Paranoia, Not Social Triumph  \n  a. \u201cAnonymity\u201d Preferred; Stranger Contact Frightens Him  \n    \u2022 He \u201cenjoyed anonymity\u2026 now all that had been suddenly changed\u2026 he wasn\u2019t at all sure he liked it\u201d (bg). His attempt to hide \u201cflashing eyes\u201d by ducking his head betrays self-conscious fear, not modesty.  \n    \u2022 \u201cCouldn\u2019t share exciting news\u2026 corrodes the spirit\u201d (bg). His persistent sleepless nights \u201cdoubting\u2026 perhaps he\u2019d put powder in someone else\u2019s tank\u201d (bg) reflect deep paranoia.  \n  b. Alienation by Loved Ones  \n    \u2022 Sister\u2019s suspicions at \u201ctell me from me that\u2014\u201d (bg) and Bill\u2019s ridicule (\u201csculptor\u201d) intensify his isolation. He \u201ctook to carrying [the box]\u2026 day and night\u201d (bg), as if guarding a lethal virus.  \n\n3. Attempts to \u201cShare\u201d Are Panic-Driven, Not Ambition  \n  a. Visit to Uncle Fabius as Plea for Sanity  \n    \u2022 He only claims \u201cjust heard the story from a friend\u201d and \u201cin that case\u2026 tell him\u201d (bg). He offers secondhand suspicion, not a demonstration. He\u2019s seeking reassurance, not partnership.  \n    \u2022 After Wheaton, he \u201clied\u201d about buying gas, stalled the car, and avoided sister\u2019s questions (bg). If he had genuine hope, he would triumphantly admit successes rather than repeatedly lie.  \n  b. Abandonment and Relapse  \n    \u2022 When \u201chumdrum\u201d lettering returns, he \u201cdid no more bathroom testing\u201d and is plagued by doubt \u201che\u2019d ever really tested\u2026 sleeplessness\u201d (bg). Yet he clandestinely fuels car at night, then hears slamming windows and flees. His relapse is compulsion born of testing his sanity, not rational experimentation.  \n\n4. \u201cFlashing Eyes\u201d as Another Curse  \n  \u2022 Vivian: \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll never know how to take advantage of them\u201d (bg). She recognizes his inability to benefit socially. His ducking and sudden departures show he cannot leverage this \u201casset.\u201d  \n  \u2022 He \u201cpulled the brim of his hat down sharply\u201d (bg), hiding from attention that alarms him, indicating flash of others\u2019 envy and threat.  \n\n5. The Galaxy Center\u2019s \u201cTest\u201d Implies Trap, Not Reward  \n  \u2022 The Invisibles\u2019 purpose: \u201cif he fails the test, he fails,\u201d and \u201csting in its tail\u201d (bg). They \u201cplague\u201d him \u201cto knock holes in inward armor.\u201d His torment, fear of madness, and suicidal thought parallels \u201cdrowning man\u201d imagery (bg), suggesting they design Gifts as torture.  \n\n6. Debater_A\u2019s Misreadings  \n  a. No Lasting Triumph Seen by Ernie  \n    \u2022 Archaeologists\u2019 \u201cwonderingly\u201d occurs \u201cOne hundred and fifty thousand years later\u201d (bg)\u2014after Meeker is dead or has lost his mind. He \u201cfelt a little sick\u201d (bg) at the blade\u2019s loss, not proud. He never sees civilization benefit.  \n  b. Social Engagement Mischaracterized  \n    \u2022 His \u201cbrowsable\u201d contact is unwanted and \u201cfrightening\u201d (bg). His only welcome is fleeting \u201cVivian,\u201d who warns his eyes\u2019 flashes are of no use. He never asks her out.  \n  c. Continued Use Equals Curse Persistence  \n    \u2022 Debater_A wrongly sees continued use as faith; it is compulsion. He cannot stop testing or fueling, despite terror and sleeplessness. He \u201ccouldn\u2019t decide on a safe place\u201d for the box, indicating obsession, not utilitarian handling.  \n\nConclusion  \nErnie Meeker\u2019s every reaction\u2014hesitation, nocturnal covert tests, alcohol sedation, social flight, sleepless paranoia, and repeated relapse into testing despite crushing anxiety\u2014reveals he is trapped by the Gifts. They isolate him, threaten his sanity, and force compulsive actions under duress. His outlook is one of a cursed test subject afraid of his own mind and the invisible malice watching him, not an optimistic pioneer of a new age.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
