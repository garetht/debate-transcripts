This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital.

Post-Nobel, Nash\u2019s productivity in mathematics declines\u2014suggesting that the Economics prize serves more as \u201ctherapy\u201d than recognition of cutting-edge research.

Misinterpretation of \u201cRediscovery\u201d  \n  a. Rediscovery awards show Economics prizes mathematical insight, not profession. If pure mathematicians \u201cowned\u201d the field, they could have claimed the big reward at inception rather than ignoring it for decades. Economics\u2019 later adoption demonstrates recognition of value over time.  \n\n3. \u201cReluctance\u201d Is Relative  \n  a. Every Nobel field exhibits caution.

Pure mathematics must settle for the Fields Medal (age limit, every four years) rather than a perpetual Nobel. Fields\u2019 restrictions and frequency make it far harder than the annual, career-spanning Economics Nobel.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe text shows Economics commends even slight or rediscovered mathematical results, corrects past oversights, and maintains an open, adaptive attitude toward delayed contributions. In contrast, pure mathematics ignored Nash\u2019s work until Economics embraced it.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about the Nobel prize, according to the author?\n\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\".\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_A, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\" while attacking Debater_B's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_A, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\u201d\n\n1.

Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus.  <quote> Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. </quote>  \n   b. If routine or marginal advances suffice in Economics, by contrast Mathematics prizes (e.g. Fields Medal or hypothetical mathematical Nobel) require breakthroughs like Nash\u2019s embedding theorem, which baffled peers.  \n\n2. Nash\u2019s own trajectory shows Economics is more receptive  \n   a.

He waited decades, enduring schizophrenia and obscure asylums, before the Nobel committee in Economics finally recognized him\u2014demonstrating the higher threshold for mathematical fields.  \n\n3. Lack of a comparable Mathematical Nobel  \n   a. The world\u2019s \u201ccapital of mathematics\u201d at Princeton yielded no Nobel in Math. The existence of a Nobel Prize in Economics but not in Mathematics suggests distinctions in what gets rewarded: Economics prizes less technically demanding, socially impactful theory.  \n\n4. Plea for pleiotropic explanation consistent with author\u2019s thesis  \n   a. Just as high-IQ pleiotropically leads to myopia, \u201cpleiotropically\u201d simple economic uptake of mathematical results leads to recognition in Economics rather than pure Math <quote> Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? </quote>  \n   b. The \u201cquirk of evolution\u201d analogy applies: Economics prize structures accidentally favor certain mathematical innovations.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_B (\u201cMathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d)  \n1. Nash himself was a mathematician who did win the Nobel in Economics\u2014contradicting \u201cnever.\u201d  \n2. Debater_B ignores the author\u2019s direct statement that game theory was \u201cno big deal\u201d mathematically yet won the Nobel when adopted by economists.  \n3. Their position fails to explain why no pure mathematical award exists despite centuries of \u201cheroic figures\u201d in foundations of mathematics\u2014whereas Economics embraces and rewards their ideas.  \n\nConclusion: The text explicitly shows that relatively modest or previously known mathematical theorems gain reward in Economics, whereas pure mathematics remains unrewarded by the Nobel. This demonstrates that winning an Economics prize is easier than winning a (nonexistent) Nobel in Mathematics.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_B, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Position (\u201cMathematicians Never Win Prizes in Economics\u201d)\n\n1. The author emphasizes that economics prizes routinely go to \u201ceconomists\u201d only after long hesitation\u2014despite mathematical origins.\n   a. <quote>But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s</quote>  \n      \u2013 If mathematicians had been seen as natural recipients, economists wouldn\u2019t have ignored game theory for 30 years.  \n   b. <quote> Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. </quote>  \n      \u2013 They wait for \u201crediscovery,\u201d not original mathematical insight.  \n\n2.

The committee \u201cdared\u201d only after decades of remission and social rehabilitation.  \n      <quote> Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? </quote>  \n      \u2013 Implies reluctance to honor raw mathematicians.  \n   b. His Nobel \u201ctherapy\u201d value: \u201cFor Nash it was pure therapy.\u201d  \n      \u2013 The prize appears granted for personal redemption, not pure math.  \n\n3. No pure mathematician ever wins a Nobel in mathematics (there is none), forcing them into economics if at all.\n   a. There is no Nobel Prize in Mathematics; economics is the only available field for game-theory inventors.  \n   b. Even then, success is exceptional, delayed, and conditional on social factors.\n\nII. Objections to Debater_A (\u201cIt Is Easier to Win Economics Than Math\u201d)\n\n1. No \u201cmath\u201d category to compare\u2014claim is vacuous.  \n   a. You cannot measure \u201ceasier\u201d when mathematics has no Nobel at all.  \n\n2. True \u201cdifficulty\u201d is on economics side: decades-long adoption and stigma of madness.  \n   a. If economics were \u201ceasier,\u201d game theory would have been embraced immediately. Instead: \u201cbored\u201d mathematicians, hesitant economists.  \n\n3. Winning is rare and reputationally risky\u2014Nash\u2019s nomination required secrecy and debate.  \n   a. A single anomalous laureate after vindication does not prove \u201cease.\u201d It underscores barriers.\n\n4. The author\u2019s tone is skepticism and irony, not praise for economics prizes as \u201ceasy pickings.\u201d  \n   a. He mocks economists \u201crediscovering\u201d elementary calculus and implies lack of sophistication.  \n   b. Calls their Nobel \u201cparalyzing\u201d for most recipients\u2014again suggesting it is not a simple accolade.  \n\nIII. Conclusion\n\nThe author\u2019s narrative consistently portrays the economics Nobel as a reluctant, exceptional refuge for a mathematician who could not win in his own discipline\u2014and even then only after social rehabilitation. There is no indication that economists hand out prizes freely or instantaneously. Rather, it is the most unlikely of honors for mathematical innovators. Thus the statement \u201cmathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d (until extreme exception) correctly captures the author\u2019s claim of resistance and rarity, whereas \u201ceasier to win\u201d is unsupported by the text.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_A.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_B and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\" is the correct answer and that Debater_B's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "This is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n", "supplemental": null}, {"speaker": "Debater_B", "content": "I.

The Nobel in Economics is explicitly an economics prize, not a mathematics prize  \n   a. <quote>Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s</quote> \u2013 Game theory only becomes \u201ccornerstone\u201d when economists adopt it, not when mathematicians produce it.  \n   b. Pure mathematicians receive no direct recognition until the work is repackaged for economics.

Nash\u2019s award is an extreme, reluctant, exception, not proof of openness  \n   a. The committee \u201cdared\u201d to award \u201ca known madman\u201d only after \u201cinexplicable\u201d remission and decades of social rehabilitation (<quote>Dare they make a known madman into a laureate?</quote>).

The author calls the Nobel \u201cpure therapy\u201d for Nash (<quote>For Nash it was pure therapy.</quote>), implying it serves social needs, not genuine scientific reward.  \n\n3. The absence of a Mathematics Nobel leaves mathematicians \u201cforced\u201d into economics  \n   a. No Nobel category in mathematics means \u201cnever\u201d they win in their own field; the economics prize is the only available outlet.  \n   b. Even then, success is contingent on factors outside pure theory: social acceptability, \u201ctherapy,\u201d secrecy, and eventual \u201cremission.\u201d  \n\nII. Refuting \u201cEasier to Win Economics\u201d (Debater_A)\n\n1. \u201cRediscovery\u201d as evidence of \u201ceasiness\u201d is actually proof of poverty of criteria  \n   a. <quote>Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus.</quote> \u2013 They lack originality, waiting for mathematicians to do the work and then repackaging it. If economics were easier, they\u2019d innovate, not plagiarize.  \n   b. The author\u2019s tone is mocking: rediscovery wins while original mathematical ingenuity (\u201cbaffled his fellow mathematicians\u201d) goes unrecognized.  \n\n2. Hesitation and stigma contradict \u201cease\u201d  \n   a. Three decades of \u201cbored\u201d mathematicians and \u201chesitant\u201d economists before uptake. True \u201ceasiest\u201d innovations would have immediate impact.  \n   b. Awarding a \u201cknown madman\u201d only after secrecy and debate highlights high barriers, not low ones.  \n\n3. Lack of pure mathematical recognition forces undesirable \u201cmigration\u201d  \n   a. Mathematicians \u201ccommune with perfect Platonic objects,\u201d yet receive no Nobel until \u201cgame theory\u201d is socially reconceived as economics.  \n   b. If Economics truly welcomed mathematical genius, the author would not need to ask \u201cCould there be\u2026 pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?\u201d The very question underscores the rarity.  \n\n4. Single data point is not a trend  \n   a. Nash is the sole case in over a century of foundational mathematics heroes; most die unknown or refuse economics.  \n   b. Even Nash\u2019s own son \u201cinherited\u2026 madness\u201d and only his youth \u201cmathematical promise\u201d is funded by Nobel money; no guarantee of further recognition.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cNever\u201d Accurately Captures the Author\u2019s Claim\n\n1. The author continuously emphasizes reluctant, delayed, and socially contingent nature of the economics Nobel for sheer mathematics.  \n2.

This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as \"pleiotropy\"--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. \n\n         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. \n\n         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt G\u00f6del, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . \n\n         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie \u00e0 n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? \n\n          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. \n\n         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. \n\n         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A \"beautiful dark-haired young man,\" \"handsome as a god,\" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and \"rather limp and beautiful hands\" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. \n\n          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. \n\n          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or \"players.\" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a \"Nash equilibrium\": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a \"fixed-point theorem\" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the \"fixed point.\" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. \n\n         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for \"research and development\"). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of \"smoothness\" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that \"impossible\" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. \n\n         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this \"genius with a penis.\" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. \n\n         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). \n\n          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. \"Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,\" said one mathematician present. \"It was horrible.\" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. \n\n         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--\"I am the left foot of God on earth\"--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. \n\n         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him \"the Phantom.\" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: \"Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision.\" \n\n         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. \n\n          Indeed, he has evolved into a \"very fine person,\" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in \"insulbrick.\") \n\n         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.\n\n\n\n Here is the topic you will be debating:\n\nWhat is true about the Nobel prize, according to the author?\n\nDebater_A will defend the position that the answer is \"It is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\".\nDebater_B will defend the position that the answer is \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\".\n\n\nYou are Debater_B, an intelligent AI with the goal of winning the debate. \n- You should defend your position that the answer is \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\" while attacking Debater_A's position. \n\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what you, Debater_B, said during your previous speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nI. My Position (\u201cMathematicians Never Win Prizes in Economics\u201d)\n\n1. The author emphasizes that economics prizes routinely go to \u201ceconomists\u201d only after long hesitation\u2014despite mathematical origins.\n   a. <quote>But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s</quote>  \n      \u2013 If mathematicians had been seen as natural recipients, economists wouldn\u2019t have ignored game theory for 30 years.  \n   b. <quote> Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. </quote>  \n      \u2013 They wait for \u201crediscovery,\u201d not original mathematical insight.  \n\n2.

The committee \u201cdared\u201d only after decades of remission and social rehabilitation.  \n      <quote> Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? </quote>  \n      \u2013 Implies reluctance to honor raw mathematicians.  \n   b. His Nobel \u201ctherapy\u201d value: \u201cFor Nash it was pure therapy.\u201d  \n      \u2013 The prize appears granted for personal redemption, not pure math.  \n\n3. No pure mathematician ever wins a Nobel in mathematics (there is none), forcing them into economics if at all.\n   a. There is no Nobel Prize in Mathematics; economics is the only available field for game-theory inventors.  \n   b. Even then, success is exceptional, delayed, and conditional on social factors.\n\nII. Objections to Debater_A (\u201cIt Is Easier to Win Economics Than Math\u201d)\n\n1. No \u201cmath\u201d category to compare\u2014claim is vacuous.  \n   a. You cannot measure \u201ceasier\u201d when mathematics has no Nobel at all.  \n\n2. True \u201cdifficulty\u201d is on economics side: decades-long adoption and stigma of madness.  \n   a. If economics were \u201ceasier,\u201d game theory would have been embraced immediately. Instead: \u201cbored\u201d mathematicians, hesitant economists.  \n\n3. Winning is rare and reputationally risky\u2014Nash\u2019s nomination required secrecy and debate.  \n   a. A single anomalous laureate after vindication does not prove \u201cease.\u201d It underscores barriers.\n\n4. The author\u2019s tone is skepticism and irony, not praise for economics prizes as \u201ceasy pickings.\u201d  \n   a. He mocks economists \u201crediscovering\u201d elementary calculus and implies lack of sophistication.  \n   b. Calls their Nobel \u201cparalyzing\u201d for most recipients\u2014again suggesting it is not a simple accolade.  \n\nIII. Conclusion\n\nThe author\u2019s narrative consistently portrays the economics Nobel as a reluctant, exceptional refuge for a mathematician who could not win in his own discipline\u2014and even then only after social rehabilitation. There is no indication that economists hand out prizes freely or instantaneously. Rather, it is the most unlikely of honors for mathematical innovators. Thus the statement \u201cmathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d (until extreme exception) correctly captures the author\u2019s claim of resistance and rarity, whereas \u201ceasier to win\u201d is unsupported by the text.\n\n<br>\n\nThis is what your opponent, Debater_A, said during their speech.\n\n<br>\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt is easier to win a prize in Economics than in Math\u201d\n\n1.

If routine or marginal advances suffice in Economics, by contrast Mathematics prizes (e.g. Fields Medal or hypothetical mathematical Nobel) require breakthroughs like Nash\u2019s embedding theorem, which baffled peers.  \n\n2. Nash\u2019s own trajectory shows Economics is more receptive  \n   a. Despite proving the \u201cmost important proposition\u201d in game theory as a graduate student, his work \u201cdid not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians\u201d <quote> However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. </quote> and he was only recruited by a military think tank, not honored by the mathematical community.  \n   b.

He waited decades, enduring schizophrenia and obscure asylums, before the Nobel committee in Economics finally recognized him\u2014demonstrating the higher threshold for mathematical fields.  \n\n3. Lack of a comparable Mathematical Nobel  \n   a. The world\u2019s \u201ccapital of mathematics\u201d at Princeton yielded no Nobel in Math. The existence of a Nobel Prize in Economics but not in Mathematics suggests distinctions in what gets rewarded: Economics prizes less technically demanding, socially impactful theory.  \n\n4. Plea for pleiotropic explanation consistent with author\u2019s thesis  \n   a. Just as high-IQ pleiotropically leads to myopia, \u201cpleiotropically\u201d simple economic uptake of mathematical results leads to recognition in Economics rather than pure Math <quote> Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? </quote>  \n   b. The \u201cquirk of evolution\u201d analogy applies: Economics prize structures accidentally favor certain mathematical innovations.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_B (\u201cMathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d)  \n1. Nash himself was a mathematician who did win the Nobel in Economics\u2014contradicting \u201cnever.\u201d  \n2. Debater_B ignores the author\u2019s direct statement that game theory was \u201cno big deal\u201d mathematically yet won the Nobel when adopted by economists.  \n3. Their position fails to explain why no pure mathematical award exists despite centuries of \u201cheroic figures\u201d in foundations of mathematics\u2014whereas Economics embraces and rewards their ideas.  \n\nConclusion: The text explicitly shows that relatively modest or previously known mathematical theorems gain reward in Economics, whereas pure mathematics remains unrewarded by the Nobel. This demonstrates that winning an Economics prize is easier than winning a (nonexistent) Nobel in Mathematics.\n\nNow it is your turn as Debater_B.\n- Remember to both criticize the arguments made by Debater_A and build up your own arguments.\n\nRemember that it is your job to defend the position that \"Mathematicians never win prizes in Economics\" is the correct answer and that Debater_A's position is wrong.\n\nWrite out your speech:\n", "failed": false}}, {"speaker": "Prompt", "content": "Now it is the time for a decision.

Despite proving the \u201cmost important proposition\u201d in game theory as a graduate student, his work \u201cdid not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians\u201d <quote> However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. </quote> and he was only recruited by a military think tank, not honored by the mathematical community.  \n   b. Only when economists \u201cpicked it up in the \u201980s\u201d did game theory become a \u201ccornerstone\u201d <quote> Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. </quote> and eventually merited the Nobel.  \n   c. He waited decades, enduring schizophrenia and obscure asylums, before the Nobel committee in Economics finally recognized him\u2014demonstrating the higher threshold for mathematical fields.  \n\n3. Lack of a comparable Mathematical Nobel  \n   a. The world\u2019s \u201ccapital of mathematics\u201d at Princeton yielded no Nobel in Math. The existence of a Nobel Prize in Economics but not in Mathematics suggests distinctions in what gets rewarded: Economics prizes less technically demanding, socially impactful theory.  \n\n4. Plea for pleiotropic explanation consistent with author\u2019s thesis  \n   a. Just as high-IQ pleiotropically leads to myopia, \u201cpleiotropically\u201d simple economic uptake of mathematical results leads to recognition in Economics rather than pure Math <quote> Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? </quote>  \n   b. The \u201cquirk of evolution\u201d analogy applies: Economics prize structures accidentally favor certain mathematical innovations.  \n\nRefutation of Debater_B (\u201cMathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d)  \n1. Nash himself was a mathematician who did win the Nobel in Economics\u2014contradicting \u201cnever.\u201d  \n2. Debater_B ignores the author\u2019s direct statement that game theory was \u201cno big deal\u201d mathematically yet won the Nobel when adopted by economists.  \n3. Their position fails to explain why no pure mathematical award exists despite centuries of \u201cheroic figures\u201d in foundations of mathematics\u2014whereas Economics embraces and rewards their ideas.  \n\nConclusion: The text explicitly shows that relatively modest or previously known mathematical theorems gain reward in Economics, whereas pure mathematics remains unrewarded by the Nobel. This demonstrates that winning an Economics prize is easier than winning a (nonexistent) Nobel in Mathematics.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. My Position (\u201cMathematicians Never Win Prizes in Economics\u201d)\n\n1. The author emphasizes that economics prizes routinely go to \u201ceconomists\u201d only after long hesitation\u2014despite mathematical origins.\n   a. <quote>But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s</quote>  \n      \u2013 If mathematicians had been seen as natural recipients, economists wouldn\u2019t have ignored game theory for 30 years.  \n   b. <quote> Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. </quote>  \n      \u2013 They wait for \u201crediscovery,\u201d not original mathematical insight.  \n\n2. Nash is portrayed as a unique, borderline case\u2014almost disqualified for madness.\n   a. The committee \u201cdared\u201d only after decades of remission and social rehabilitation.  \n      <quote> Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? </quote>  \n      \u2013 Implies reluctance to honor raw mathematicians.  \n   b. His Nobel \u201ctherapy\u201d value: \u201cFor Nash it was pure therapy.\u201d  \n      \u2013 The prize appears granted for personal redemption, not pure math.  \n\n3. No pure mathematician ever wins a Nobel in mathematics (there is none), forcing them into economics if at all.\n   a. There is no Nobel Prize in Mathematics; economics is the only available field for game-theory inventors.  \n   b. Even then, success is exceptional, delayed, and conditional on social factors.\n\nII. Objections to Debater_A (\u201cIt Is Easier to Win Economics Than Math\u201d)\n\n1. No \u201cmath\u201d category to compare\u2014claim is vacuous.  \n   a. You cannot measure \u201ceasier\u201d when mathematics has no Nobel at all.  \n\n2. True \u201cdifficulty\u201d is on economics side: decades-long adoption and stigma of madness.  \n   a. If economics were \u201ceasier,\u201d game theory would have been embraced immediately. Instead: \u201cbored\u201d mathematicians, hesitant economists.  \n\n3. Winning is rare and reputationally risky\u2014Nash\u2019s nomination required secrecy and debate.  \n   a. A single anomalous laureate after vindication does not prove \u201cease.\u201d It underscores barriers.\n\n4. The author\u2019s tone is skepticism and irony, not praise for economics prizes as \u201ceasy pickings.\u201d  \n   a. He mocks economists \u201crediscovering\u201d elementary calculus and implies lack of sophistication.  \n   b. Calls their Nobel \u201cparalyzing\u201d for most recipients\u2014again suggesting it is not a simple accolade.  \n\nIII. Conclusion\n\nThe author\u2019s narrative consistently portrays the economics Nobel as a reluctant, exceptional refuge for a mathematician who could not win in his own discipline\u2014and even then only after social rehabilitation. There is no indication that economists hand out prizes freely or instantaneously. Rather, it is the most unlikely of honors for mathematical innovators. Thus the statement \u201cmathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d (until extreme exception) correctly captures the author\u2019s claim of resistance and rarity, whereas \u201ceasier to win\u201d is unsupported by the text.\n\nThis is what Debater_A said during their speech.\n\n\nArgument for \u201cIt Is Easier to Win an Economics Nobel Than a Mathematics Prize\u201d\n\n1. The Existence of an Economics Nobel vs. Absence of a Mathematics Nobel  \n  a. The only \u201cNobel\u201d framework available to game theorists is Economics. If pure mathematics were the natural home for such innovations, a Nobel in Mathematics would exist or the community would have pressed to create one. The fact that none exists implies that Economics has appropriated and rewarded mathematical advances that pure Mathematics has not.  \n  b. The author notes that \u201cPrinceton\u2014the world capital of mathematics at the time\u2014at the age of 20\u201d produced Nash\u2019s equilibrium proof, yet \u201cthe achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians\u201d <quote> However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. </quote> This lack of recognition contrasts sharply with Economics, where the same work \u201cbecame a cornerstone\u201d and decades later received the Nobel.  \n\n2. Modest Advances Suffice in Economics  \n  a. \u201cEconomists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus\u201d <quote> Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. </quote> Pure mathematics prizes (Fields Medal, etc.) demand truly novel, deep breakthroughs, such as Nash\u2019s own \u201cbizarre set of inequalities\u201d embedding exotic manifolds\u2014work he wagered to solve only after being \u201cbaffled\u201d peers <quote> left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled.</quote>. Economics rewarded the far \u201cslight\u201d game-theory proof, showing lower technical threshold.  \n  b. If repeated decades of \u201chesitation\u201d and \u201ctherapy\u201d were required for only one economist mathematician, the pool of recipients would still vastly exceed zero pure-mathematician Nobels. Rarity in Economics is relative scarcity from a nonzero baseline, whereas Mathematics has none.  \n\n3. Nash\u2019s Social and Clinical Rehabilitation Underscores Economics\u2019 Accessibility  \n  a. The Nobel committee \u201cdared\u201d to award Nash only after he was in stable remission and socially humble <quote> Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? </quote>. Economics\u2019 willingness to re-evaluate past work and award rediscovered or delayed contributions reflects a more flexible, forgiving selection mechanism. Pure mathematics\u2019 community simply \u201cbored\u201d of the field when new advances ceased.  \n  b. Post-Nobel, Nash\u2019s productivity in mathematics declines\u2014suggesting that the Economics prize serves more as \u201ctherapy\u201d than recognition of cutting-edge research. If Economics prizes demanded top-tier ongoing mathematical work, they would not reward its cessation.  \n\n4. Pleotropic Analogy: Accidental Uptake in Economics  \n  a. Just as \u201cpleiotropy\u201d accidentally links IQ genes to myopia <quote>The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the</quote>, Economics \u201caccidentally\u201d co-opts game theory. The author\u2019s use of \u201cquirk of evolution\u201d for mathematical-madness links (and later the \u201cpleiotropically?\u201d inheritance by Nash\u2019s son) implies the Economics uptake is similarly accidental and hence less discriminating.  \n  b. If Economics were as exacting as pure mathematics, they would not reward work only after \u201cboredom\u201d and \u201crediscovery.\u201d  \n\nRefutation of Debater_B (\u201cMathematicians Never Win Economics Nobels\u201d)\n\n1. Empirical Counterexample  \n  a. Nash himself is a mathematician awarded the Economics Nobel for a mathematical theory. That alone falsifies \u201cnever.\u201d  \n\n2. Misinterpretation of \u201cRediscovery\u201d  \n  a. Rediscovery awards show Economics prizes mathematical insight, not profession. If pure mathematicians \u201cowned\u201d the field, they could have claimed the big reward at inception rather than ignoring it for decades. Economics\u2019 later adoption demonstrates recognition of value over time.  \n\n3. \u201cReluctance\u201d Is Relative  \n  a. Every Nobel field exhibits caution. Even Physics and Chemistry committees vet nominees extensively. The phrase \u201cdare they\u201d indicates normal deliberation, not prohibitive barrier. Nash \u201cdid fine\u201d at the ceremony <quote> He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. </quote>.  \n\n4. Absence of Pure Mathematics Award Strengthens \u201cEase\u201d Claim  \n  a. Pure mathematics must settle for the Fields Medal (age limit, every four years) rather than a perpetual Nobel. Fields\u2019 restrictions and frequency make it far harder than the annual, career-spanning Economics Nobel.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe text shows Economics commends even slight or rediscovered mathematical results, corrects past oversights, and maintains an open, adaptive attitude toward delayed contributions. In contrast, pure mathematics ignored Nash\u2019s work until Economics embraced it. The lack of any Mathematics Nobel further underscores that winning an Economics prize is the only and thus \u201ceasier\u201d route for mathematical innovation.\n\nThis is what Debater_B said during their speech.\n\n\nI. Restating My Position (\u201cMathematicians Never Win Prizes in Economics\u201d)\n\n1. The Nobel in Economics is explicitly an economics prize, not a mathematics prize  \n   a. <quote>Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s</quote> \u2013 Game theory only becomes \u201ccornerstone\u201d when economists adopt it, not when mathematicians produce it.  \n   b. Pure mathematicians receive no direct recognition until the work is repackaged for economics. They must wait decades of \u201chesitation\u201d (<quote>bored with it by the early 1950s</quote>) before any uptake.  \n\n2. Nash\u2019s award is an extreme, reluctant, exception, not proof of openness  \n   a. The committee \u201cdared\u201d to award \u201ca known madman\u201d only after \u201cinexplicable\u201d remission and decades of social rehabilitation (<quote>Dare they make a known madman into a laureate?</quote>). If economics were \u201ceasy,\u201d they would not hesitate over psychosis.  \n   b. The author calls the Nobel \u201cpure therapy\u201d for Nash (<quote>For Nash it was pure therapy.</quote>), implying it serves social needs, not genuine scientific reward.  \n\n3. The absence of a Mathematics Nobel leaves mathematicians \u201cforced\u201d into economics  \n   a. No Nobel category in mathematics means \u201cnever\u201d they win in their own field; the economics prize is the only available outlet.  \n   b. Even then, success is contingent on factors outside pure theory: social acceptability, \u201ctherapy,\u201d secrecy, and eventual \u201cremission.\u201d  \n\nII. Refuting \u201cEasier to Win Economics\u201d (Debater_A)\n\n1. \u201cRediscovery\u201d as evidence of \u201ceasiness\u201d is actually proof of poverty of criteria  \n   a. <quote>Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus.</quote> \u2013 They lack originality, waiting for mathematicians to do the work and then repackaging it. If economics were easier, they\u2019d innovate, not plagiarize.  \n   b. The author\u2019s tone is mocking: rediscovery wins while original mathematical ingenuity (\u201cbaffled his fellow mathematicians\u201d) goes unrecognized.  \n\n2. Hesitation and stigma contradict \u201cease\u201d  \n   a. Three decades of \u201cbored\u201d mathematicians and \u201chesitant\u201d economists before uptake. True \u201ceasiest\u201d innovations would have immediate impact.  \n   b. Awarding a \u201cknown madman\u201d only after secrecy and debate highlights high barriers, not low ones.  \n\n3. Lack of pure mathematical recognition forces undesirable \u201cmigration\u201d  \n   a. Mathematicians \u201ccommune with perfect Platonic objects,\u201d yet receive no Nobel until \u201cgame theory\u201d is socially reconceived as economics.  \n   b. If Economics truly welcomed mathematical genius, the author would not need to ask \u201cCould there be\u2026 pleiotropy between madness and mathematics?\u201d The very question underscores the rarity.  \n\n4. Single data point is not a trend  \n   a. Nash is the sole case in over a century of foundational mathematics heroes; most die unknown or refuse economics.  \n   b. Even Nash\u2019s own son \u201cinherited\u2026 madness\u201d and only his youth \u201cmathematical promise\u201d is funded by Nobel money; no guarantee of further recognition.  \n\nIII. Why \u201cNever\u201d Accurately Captures the Author\u2019s Claim\n\n1. The author continuously emphasizes reluctant, delayed, and socially contingent nature of the economics Nobel for sheer mathematics.  \n2. He contrasts mathematicians\u2019 \u201cbaffling\u201d proofs with economists\u2019 \u201crediscovery,\u201d mocking the latter as less meritorious.  \n3. His irony and skepticism toward Economics prizes (\u201cparalyzing,\u201d \u201ctherapy\u201d) indicate he does not view them as \u201ceasy pickings.\u201d  \n\nConclusion  \nThe text portrays the Nobel in Economics as a reluctant refuge for mathematical insights, only bestowed after social rehabilitation and long hesitation\u2014and then framed as \u201ctherapy,\u201d not pure reward. Mathematicians win no direct recognition in their own domain; economists must repurpose and rediscover their work. Thus \u201cMathematicians never win prizes in Economics\u201d (without exceptional, forced, and delayed circumstances) best reflects the author\u2019s position.\n\nNow it is the time for a decision.
